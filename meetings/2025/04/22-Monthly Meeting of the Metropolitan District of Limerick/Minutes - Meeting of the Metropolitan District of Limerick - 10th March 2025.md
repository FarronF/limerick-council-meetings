**QUESTIONS**

**6.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many social, affordable***

***and private housing units have been delivered in the Metropolitan District of Limerick to date,***

***under our development plan housing targets, and how many units are expected to be delivered***

***annually over the lifetime of the plan.***

**REPLY**:

Table 1 below describes the total number of actual social, affordable and private housing units

(Column B) that have been completed in the Metropolitan District of Limerick from 2022 to 2024.

The Development Plan housing targets (as described under the Development Plan's Housing Needs

Demand Assessment) for each year from 2022 to 2008 are provided in column A below.

It is difficult to predict the overall expected number of units to be delivered in the Metropolitan

District over the lifetime of the plan to 2028. However, the Housing Directorate has a clear live

overview of the affordable and social housing pipeline up to 2028, as outlined in Columns C and D.
---

As of the end of January 2025, in Limerick City and Suburbs and Metropolitan Area, live planning

permission is in place for 5,182 units and construction has commenced on 1,879 of these units

since 2019. Permission is in place for 3,303 units, which have not yet commenced in the

Metropolitan District.

Planning permissions exist but do not guarantee development completions. However, State

subventions introduced in 2022 through the CREL/STAR schemes for cost-rental delivery and

AHF/First Home scheme for affordable sale delivery are now starting to show results in delivery

numbers in 2023 and 2024 within the Metropolitan District. See Column D.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council are liaising with Uisce Eireann to determine a solution and

funding source to address road defects that have been caused by the previous installation

of a watermain service at Greenfields, Rosbrien. Once agreed a road pavement repair and

surfacing strategy for this area will be determined.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick Council provide***

***an update on what is happening with The Horizon Site Dublin Road. The site has been left derelict***

***for years.***

**REPLY**: I am pleased to confirm that the owners of the Horizon Mall site (Kirkland) are engaging

with the local authority in relation to progressing their new masterplan for the

development of the site.

It is hoped that the developer will complete this work soon and move on to preparing a

**12.Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what is the status of the***

***dockless bike scheme for Castletroy/Annacotty and when will it be expanded beyond Castletroy***

***to Corbally and Castleconnell.***

**REPLY**: The dockless bike share pilot scheme which was operated by Tier-Dott concluded in

December 2024. Tier-Dott have since ceased operations in Ireland.

The TFI Bike Share scheme operating across Limerick City is not affected by the conclusion

of the pilot dockless scheme. The National Transport Authority has advised that the

operation of the TFI Bike Share scheme is expected to be re-tendered later this year.

Limerick City and County Council is working with the NTA to define an expanded

geographical operating area for the TFI Bike Share scheme. We do not currently have a

timeline for the roll out of the expanded scheme.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will ask at the next**meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, for an update on previous***

***engagements that took place between Limerick City and County Council, Limerick Animal Welfare***

***and local guards to crackdown on the numerous puppy farms located throughout the city and***

***county.***

**REPLY:**Under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, dog breeders are obliged to register their

premises with the Council. The definition of a dog-breeding establishment under the Act is

a premises where six or more breeding bitches are kept. Premises with less than six bitches

are not obliged to register.

Complaints regarding illegal dog breeding establishments are investigated by the Dog

Wardens, sometimes in conjunction with An Garda Síochána. Limerick Animal Welfare does

not have a statutory role regarding this process.

Some complaints received by the Council do not result in enforcement actions because the

premises are found to be already registered and have been inspected, or because there are

fewer than six breeding bitches on site. Dog Wardens ensure that dog licences are in place,

and, if not, issue the required Section 16 Notice.

The dog breeding establishment function of the Council is in the course of being taken over

by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine during 2025, and veterinary

surgeons within the Department will be enforcing the Act when this transfer is complete.

***the Limerick social housing list that have**a**disability.***

**REPLY**: There are 322 people (identifying as Main Applicant) over 55 with a disability on the social

housing waiting list. This figure covers Limerick City and County and includes those on the

transfer list.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if a site has yet been***

***identified for a community centre in Castletroy.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council have committed to developing a strategy for community

facilities based on the findings of the Community Facilities Audit already completed. The

strategy will assist in the development of improved community infrastructure across the

city and county. There is an awareness of the needs raised for the Castletroy area and this

will be considered in the development of the strategy.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a delivery timeline of***

***the proposed new Park in the Groody area as part of the Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy's***

***implementation.***

**REPLY**: There is currently no timeline for the delivery of a new Park in the Groody Valley. The

purpose of specifically mentioning this particular green space in the Blue Green

Infrastructure Strategy was to highlight its potential as a Park and to ensure that it is

retained as a green space for recreational and ecological purposes, given its proximity to

residential areas and the importance of green spaces for health and wellbeing.

The Council can consider the delivery of this project in due course and are cognisant of its

delivery as part of other development plans for the area. There is currently no funding in

place for the delivery of the project.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what process took place to***

***identify / assess the projects put forward for the Historic Structures Fund and what team /***

***directorate executed this.***

the Public Realm and Heritage Team, within the Planning and Place-Making Directorate.

The assessment panel consisted of:

 Maria Woods, Senior Planner

 Gráinne McMahon, Senior Executive Architect

 Shóna O’Keeffe, Executive Architectural Conservation Officer

 Nancy O’Neill, Assistant Architectural Conservation Officer

The assessment panel carried out a full review of each submission to ensure its eligibility in

accordance with the Circular Guidance Document for the Historic Structures Fund and the

panel visited each structure.

The panel carried out an assessment of each project against the criteria as set out in Section

4 of the guidance circular, issued by the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Housing. These criteria are as follows:

 Efficacy of the Grant in Achieving the Aims of the Historic Structures Fund.
---

 Quality of the Methodology and Technical Merit of the Works Proposed.

 Contribution of the Proposed Works to Keeping the Structure in Use, or Bringing it Back

to Use.

 Broader public or community benefit of the project.

Each project was assigned a mark corresponding to how it addressed each of these criteria,

and the top three scoring projects were recommended for submission to the Department

of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The recommendation was agreed by the

Senior Management Team in advance of the letter issuing to the Department.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the lighting***

***of the railway bridge on Childers Road as it was to be completed in May 2025.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council have recently completed repairs to the existing lighting

infrastructure adjacent to the Childers Road Railway Bridge. The Public lighting team are

also examining further additional lighting options which are dependent on approval from

Irish Rail and funding availability.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if this Council has a specific***

***staff member who holds the title of ‘horse warden’. If not, do they intend to fill this role. If there***

***is not someone in this role locally, where does the licensed officer who fulfils this role for Limerick***

***Council travel from.***

**REPLY**: The LCCC Veterinary Services section has responsibility for enforcement of the Control of

Horses Act 1996 and the Limerick City and County Council (Control of Horses) Bye Laws

2017. Section 3 of the Act allows the Council to appoint Authorised Persons who may

exercise any of the functions conferred under this Act, such as the seizure of horses

The Council has privately contracted pound services provided by ACS, located in Cork, who

are the appointed authorised officers for the Council. The LCCC Veterinary Services team

work in close collaboration with An Garda Siochána and ACS in the carrying out Horse

Control functions, responding to complaints, monitoring the green areas of the city,

scheduling seizures and engaging with horse owners.  The title of ‘Horse Warden’ is not a

role set out under the Act.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for this Council to please***

***clarify which department has responsibility for the removal of dumped waste/litter from green***

***spaces in the Metropolitan area.***

**21.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a timeline for the***

***installation of automatic red-light cameras to monitor road users who break red lights***

***throughout the Metropolitan area.***

**REPLY**: The provision of static traffic light cameras and their implementation is a project under the

supervision of the National Transport Authority.

At present there is no timeline regarding their implementation in the Metropolitan District

of Limerick.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***proposed 24 units at Barnakyle, Patrickswell and in particular the request by the elected***

***members whilst considering the Part 8 that 50% of these units be made available for purchase***

***under the Affordable Purchase Scheme.***

**REPLY**: The current unit mix for the Barnakyle development is as follows:



8 No. 2-bed units



11 No. 3-bed units



5 No. 4-bed units

In terms of project progress, the development is currently at Stage 3 under the Social

Housing Capital Investment Scheme. Tender drawings were fully completed in September

2024, and we are presently awaiting the Connection Agreement for Uisce Éireann before

advancing further.

A significant redesign was undertaken in March 2022, following initial approval of Stage 2 by

the Department. This redesign was at the request of an Elected Member to

incorporate provisions for elderly housing and homes suited for incremental

purchase (starter home purchase scheme targeted at working HAP/RAS tenants). A revised

Stage 2 submission was subsequently made and approved by the Department in July 2022.

The Part 8 planning process commenced on 3rd September 2022.

We note from the minutes of the meeting where the Part 8 was decided a specific query

seeking if Limerick City and County Council could apply to the Department of Housing to

allow for 50% of this development to be designated as affordable funding for this scheme.

The Housing Construction Unit are advancing this project through the Social Housing Capital

Investment Scheme. Should a review be undertaken to assess if 50% of the scheme would

be considered eligible for the Affordable Housing Fund would require a number of checks:



Eligibility check for Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) to meet a minimum of 15% reduction

involving an independent all-in cost estimate alongside an independent valuation.

Should that check above be deemed positive, the following steps are required:
---
10



Engagement internally and with the DHLGH on the matter to seek their advisory in the

context of our suboptimal delivery of social housing against our targets



Engagement with the Finance Section of LCCC to determine loan capacity



Engagement with the Local Government Auditor

An assessment of this will be undertaken as soon as the Connection Agreement is secured.

Elected Members will be updated in due course.

investigating options with TII to develop Clarina Roundabout under a proposed sponsorship

scheme. We will continue to follow up on this and provide an update once available.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, it was agreed to take Item No. 29 next.
---
11

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council urge***

***Limerick Libraries to adopt a home delivery service similar to that of other Local Authorities***

***around the country for residents who are unable to visit their local library due to illness, reduced***

***mobility or disability.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara, seconded by Councillor

Donoghue and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hickey-O’Mara highlighted the possible benefits of a home

delivery service and referred to a number of other Local Authorities in the country that were

providing the service.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Library Service provides a comprehensive library service to urban

and rural populations over an extensive geographic area. The service includes 16 no.

Library Branches and a Mobile Library. This level of service compares favourably with other

City and County Library services across the country.

In relation to residents who are unable to visit their local library we offer a “house bound

service” from their nearest convenient library or mobile stop. When a person requests this

service we ask them to nominate a friend or family member to collect their library items on

their behalf. It is a practical, simple and cost effective solution to this demand.

At national level there is no one-size-fits-all approach to providing this service. Each Library

Authority has adopted its own solutions to meet their specific requirements. The feedback

nationally is that there is not a high level of expressed demand for a home delivery service.

Our experience is that the current Limerick offer addresses the need for a house bound

service for Limerick, within the library resources available.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council undertake***

***a feasibility study on the Council owned site adjacent to Dooradoyle Mens Shed as suitable***

***location for a community centre.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Donoghue and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin referred to the significant increase in population in the

Raheen/Mungret/Dooradoyle areas, which has a mix of young families and elderly residents. He

highlighted the need to provide a hub for educational, sporting and community groups to support

the people living in those areas.

**REPLY**: The Council is currently looking at the best possible option for the Council owned site

adjacent to the Men’s Shed in Dooradoyle. If it is decided to make this available for a

Community Centre it is at this stage a feasibility study will be undertaken.
---
12

Members welcomed the Motion but expressed concerns regarding the necessity of conducting

another feasibility study for a community centre at this location.

In response to the members' concerns, the LCDC Chief Officer explained that a feasibility study is

needed for the Council owned site under consideration as a potential location for the community

centre, in order to assess its suitability.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council invite the***

***Land Development Agency to a meeting to brief members on the several sites in the city awaiting***

***housing planning applications in the city.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Secas and agreed.

Councillor Leddin welcomed the confirmation that the briefing had been scheduled for Monday,

7th April 2025. He highlighted the importance of the Land Development Agency providing a full

update to Members on the timescale for delivery of housing on the key sites in the city, especially

with the ongoing housing crisis

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with the Department of Housing to determine the status of the Tenant In***

***Situ scheme, as the delays from the Department are causing unnecessary stress for landlords,***

***tenants and Council officials.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan, seconded by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Gavan stated that confirmation of the allocated funding was

urgently required, as applicants were waiting a long time for a decision on the scheme.

Members expressed support for the Motion, highlighting the success of the Tenant in Situ Scheme,

and emphasised the need to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Heritage to stress the urgency of providing a Scheme for 2025 to support those in need.

**REPLY**: We are engaging weekly with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage

(DHLGH) in relation to the status of the 2025 Tenant in Situ Scheme. We have outlined the

urgency in providing a budget allocation for 2025 as we currently have a large number of

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Beasley**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council conduct an immediate Safety Audit of the Parkway Roundabout in Limerick.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Beasley, seconded by Councillor Reale and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Beasley highlighted the traffic volumes at the roundabout and

the difficulties for pedestrians and cyclists. She referred to the importance of the junction for public

transport and the need for a comprehensive traffic review at the location.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council is planning to undertake a comprehensive safety review

of several key junctions and roundabouts within the Limerick City area. This initiative spans

multiple Directorates and Departments within the organisation and must align with the

Council's travel and transport strategies. Notably, the Parkway roundabout will be included

in this review.

Following discussions, it was agreed to provide the Elected Members with an update on the

outcomes of the Parkway Roundabout review.

**30.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council ensures***

***that all dogs rehomed directly from Limerick Dog Shelter are neutered or spayed before being***

***released to their new owners.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara, seconded by Councillor Gavan

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hickey-O’Mara referred to the large percentage of dogs that

were successfully moved to sanctuaries. For those that were rehomed directly, he highlighted the

importance of neutering, which would prevent diseases and manage over population.

**REPLY**: Limerick Dog Shelter is maintained to accommodate dogs seized, accepted or detained

under any of the provisions of the Control of Dogs Act. The Council operate the shelter

under the functions of the Act in respect of the acceptance, detention, disposal and

destruction of stray and unwanted dogs.

The Dog Shelter operates within the following principles;

That dogs are housed in the Dog Shelter appropriately and that staff monitor the welfare of

any dogs being held in the shelter on an ongoing basis. That each animal has;

 A dry place to rest

 Access to fresh water and food.

 Adequate ventilation

 Adequate veterinary care

 The space necessary to assume normal postures such as lying, sitting, and standing.

 Protection from extreme weather whether hot or cold.

Stray dogs are kept in the Dog Pound for at least 5 days to allow the owner an opportunity

to reclaim their dog. Once this period as elapsed, where the dog has not been reclaimed,

it will be assessed by Council staff and will be rehomed or humanely euthanized. Dog shelter

staff undertake to rehome suitable dogs as quickly as possible whether directly to the public

or through charities.

Neutering or spaying requires a post-operative care period of 10-14 days following the

procedure. During this time, animals should be monitored closely particularly in the 24 hour

period following the operation and pain medication must be administered to the animal

regularly. Post-operative animals would need separated from other dogs in the shelter to

avoid the spread of infection. The cost of spaying and neutering varies between €200 and

€400 depending on the weight of the dog. The Dog Shelter is not resourced to cover the

cost of the procedures or to provide the level of post-operative care required. In addition,

the current layout of the building and kennels would not accommodate this type of activity.

**31.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Mayor and the***

***Director General liaise with UL and An Garda Síochána, to set up and chair a taskforce to address***

***car parking problems in residential areas around the University of Limerick.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Doyle and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the severe parking issues in the residential

areas around University of Limerick, which are causing difficulties for both residents and

emergency services. She emphasised that the establishment of a task force would provide a forum

for discussion and possible solutions.

**REPLY**: The University of Limerick (UL) community liaison group, which includes representatives

from Limerick City and County Council (LCCC), An Garda Síochána (AGS), UL, and local

residents, is actively seeking solutions to the ongoing parking issues. Despite the LCCC

Traffic Warden issuing tickets, the problem persists.

Previously, LCCC and AGS led the "Think Before You Park" campaign, with AGS patrolling the

areas last year. The parking problems are largely due to the high number of properties

rented to multiple residents. While private student accommodations have started charging

for parking permits, the public roads have limited capacity, and the demand for parking

remains high.

The Mayor has indicated his willingness to meet the community liaison group and is looking

forward to engaging with the Councillor on the matter.

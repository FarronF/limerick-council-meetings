Councillor McSweeney asked how the Mayoral Programme fits into to this SPC and requested that

policies in Mayoral Programme be brought to SPC.

Mr. Murray responded that the Mayoral Programme is new to Local Government, and it is a learning

process. Some of the objectives contained in the Mayoral Programme are policy related.

**Item 3: To receive a presentation for discussion on the Proposed Development Contribution**

**Scheme 2025**

Ms. Brislane gave members an overview of the proposed Development Scheme 2025 workshop with

the main points being:



Legislative Background

 The making of a contribution scheme is a reserved function.

 Primary objective is to offset a portion of the costs for public infrastructure.



Current Scheme Costs – January 2022



Proposed rates previously presented at workshop and concerns from workshop.



Proposed residential rates.



Proposed Non-Residential rates.



Comparison between previous schemes in 2013 and 2022 versus proposed 2025 scheme.

Inflation figures shown in slide.



How LCCC current rates compare with other Local Authorities.



IDA reduction – currently 50% reduction, proposed to be lowered to 25%.



Projected yield for commercial and residential development is €75.9m between 2025 and

2030. Total required is €168m as per project list.

The members thanked Ms. Brislane for her presentation and a discussion followed:



Councillor Pond asked if the residential charge per sqm includes the garage area. Ms.

Brislane confirmed that the charge is on the house only.



Mr. Joyce raised the constant rising costs of building houses, soft costs like Uisce Éireann and

development contributions are required upfront, and these costs are being passed on to

first-time buyers. Can LCCC look at charging the development contributions on a phased

basis or for the contribution to be paid at end of the process as it is harsh on developers to

pay these costs upfront? A number of members supported Mr. Joyce’s proposal to pay the

contribution at the end of the development. Ms. O’Connell clarified that LCCC does allow for

phased payments, especially in large scale developments. Mr. Murray advised that the

Department of Housing, Local Government & Heritage has paid the development
---
contributions for residential properties for the last 2 years. The development contributions

have paid for essential services such as playgrounds to build strong and sustainable

communities which has saved developers having to deliver them.



Mr. Golden echoed Mr. Joyce’s viewpoint and while he took the point of the Government

support over the last 2 years, there is no commitment that this will continue.



Councillor McSweeney asked why do the rural charges have to be more expensive and can

the proposed residential €35 per sqm charge be brought down to €25 per sqm in line with

City?



Councillor McSweeney also asked to look at cutting some of the projects on the list as some

of these are unrealistic – €30m for Adare? It was noted that some of the projects identified

by Elected Members are not included on the list. A number of the SPC members supported

Councillor McSweeney’s proposal that the projects list should be reviewed. Ms. Woods

advised that an updated Project List had been circulated that morning to the Councillors.

Councillor Keary said that a number of these projects shouldn’t be funded by levies and

funding should be sourced elsewhere e.g. TII. Mr. Murray responded that a number of

projects on the list require match funding e.g. URDF projects are only 75% funded so match

funding is required for the other 25%.



Councillor Donoghue asked in relation to table presented with the Local Authorities listed if

Limerick is currently placed where the yellow band is and where LCCC will place when

changes are implemented. Her constituents are looking for very basic maintenance works to

be carried out and asked if these were on the projects lists such as footpaths and potholes.

Ms. Woods clarified that LCCC will place middle of the list with proposed charges.

Councillor Donoghue supported the increase in levies and asked how other LA’S charge

more levies and still build houses and surprised that Limerick was not similar to other LA’s.



Councillor Galvin may not be supporting the increase in levies as he does not see benefit to

rural areas. He asked the Chair what benefit will one off rural development get from these

contributions? Councillor Doyle responded that the benefit is in the nearby towns with the

provision of libraries, playgrounds etc.



Mr. Thompson said that he generally agrees with the strategy and town and city centre

development. The housing crisis needs to be addressed in an urban setting where people

want to live. He agrees with increases, and they are fully justified.



Councillor Keary asked where the city centre zoning starts and finishes. A zoned map was

shown at the meeting from the Development Plan. Ms. Woods explained that the area

shaded in blue is zoned city centre and to change this would require a variation of the

current Development Plan or the next Development Plan. The Map shown will be circulated

to the members.



If members want to add projects to the list, they should contact Ms. Woods and Ms.

Brislane.

The Chair moved on to the next item and stated that another workshop with Members is required.

**Item 4: To receive a presentation for noting on proposed Shop Front Design Guidelines**

Ms. Wood updated members on the preparation of Shopfront Design Guidelines which is an

objective in the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 – Objective ECON 015 Active Street Frontage



Introduction

 Scope of guidelines



Historic Importance of Shopfront



Shopfront Principles



Shopfront Elements



Shopfront Checklist

The members welcomed the guidelines and had a number of questions:



Will there be funding to do up shopfronts? There are a lot of advantages to these guidelines.



Is this a statutory document and are these options rather than mandatory?



Do LCCC envisage any enforcement through planning and is there power to enforce this

retrospectively?



Are these guidelines for City & County?

Response from LCCC officials:



LCCC will try to encourage replacement signage through funding.



This is a guidance document that shows best practice. It is a non-statutory document.



The guidelines will assist the Planning Department with development management and

enforcement.



Guidelines are for City and County.



There are a number of architects in the Place-Making & Public Realm Teams who can

provide guidance on this.

Councillor Gavan said that this is an opportunity to coordinate colour and improve the general

aesthetic of the city centre in time for Ryder Cup and welcomed the document.

Ms. Woods circulated a copy of the document at the meeting. The presentation will be circulated to

members.

The Chair Cllr. Doyle sought an extension to the meeting at 3.50pm to continue with the remaining

agenda items. The members agreed and the meeting reconvened.

**Item 6: Notice of Motion**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (referred from the Meeting of the**

**Metropolitan District held on 20th** **January 2025 to the Economic Development, Enterprise,**

**Tourism and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council calls on**

**the Government to provide additional financial incentives and supports to encourage the owners**

**of unoccupied properties located in the city centre to redevelop for commercial and or residential**

**purposes.**

**The Notice of Motion was formally seconded by both Mr. Joyce and Councillor Reale.**

In proposing the motion Cllr. Leddin stated that there is a need to incentivise the redevelopment of

unoccupied properties in Limerick. The Chair agreed with Cllr. Leddin’s Motion.

Mr. Thompson said that the perception of obstacles placed in front of owners' stems from their lack

of understanding of building problems. Therefore, there might be 2 components to incentives - one

would be to aid the understanding of the building and what needs to be fixed and the second to

assist in the actual capital costs of the works required and that these be independent of each other.

He also agreed that zero % VAT rate on such works is a good start.

Mr Murray said that a written response has been done for this Notion of Motion by a colleague and

if the reply is supported it can be included in the SPC Chairperson’s Report for the full Council.

The Chair thanked Mr. Murray for the response to Cllr. Leddin’s Notice of Motion and that the

recommendation will be included in the SPC Chairperson’s Report.

**Item 7: Dates for SPC meetings;**

The Chair sought approval on the proposed SPC meeting dates for 2025: Monday 14th April 2025,

Monday 23rd, June 2025, Monday 13th  October 2025 and Monday, 8th December 2025.

The members agreed the proposed dates. Councillor Pond proposed that meetings start at 2.15 pm

going forward. This was agreed by consensus.

**Item 8: AOB**

Mr. Thompson mentioned that he attended a seminar on the RIAI ‘Irish Cities in Crisis’ which he

highly recommends to Members to look at and that he has some copies of an Executive Summary of

the original if anyone is interested.

The Chair concluded the meeting.

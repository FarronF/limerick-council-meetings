**Enhancement of Bus Services in Raheen and Mungret Areas**

We request that the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee of

Limerick City and County Council take the following actions to prioritise the earliest

possible delivery of proposed BusConnects routes 4a and 4b:

1. **Facilitate a Stakeholder Meeting**:

Organise a meeting involving all relevant stakeholders, including but not limited to: -

o Limerick City and County Council

o Bus Éireann

o National Transport Authority (NTA)

o Industrial Development Authority (IDA)

o Limerick Chamber

o Representative from the affected schools and their respective Parents’

Associations.

2. **Initiate Trial Services During Peak Times:**

As an initial step, implement trial runs of the 4a and 4b routes during peak

times from late August 2025. This trial will assess the feasibility, demand, and

operational considerations of the new routes, providing valuable data for full-

scale implementation for the full rollout of the BusConnects project.

Questions

7. Question submitted by Councillor O’Sullivan

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update on progress in relation to the take-over of the 9 apartments in the Old Convent
in Kilfinane and an allocation date update.

REPLY:

The Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) project for Elderly persons by Sophia Housing
Association at the site of St Pauls Convent, Kilfinane is near complete and ready for
occupation. A water connection is still required at the site and we were advised on
13/3/2025 that a connection offer has now been issued by Uisce Eireann to Sophia. Once
the offer is paid and the connection is in place, Sophia expect to be in a position to
allocate the units 1-2 weeks later. Sophia have advised us that the connection offer will
be paid immediately upon receipt. Limerick City and County Council's Allocations team
have identified potential tenants for the units and will progress this once the delayed
water connection issue has been resolved and once they have an accurate timeline for
completion,

In addition to the 7 no. 1-bed and 2 no. 2-bed apartments Sophia are also near
completion on a Communal Facility space within the building. This facility is aimed at
providing an area for residents to meet and engage in group activities and may
occasionally include visitors from the wider public e.g., active retirement groups etc.

8. Question submitted by Councillor Carey

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update on works re the Market House and the Old Creamery, Kilfinane and what are the
next steps for both projects.

REPLY:

Funding was sought for the redevelopment of the Market House in Kilfinane and the
master planning of the wider lands in community ownership under the Rural
Regeneration and Development Fund in 2024 and unfortunately was unsuccessful in
securing funding. The Rural, Culture, Community and Tourism Development Directorate
have committed to work with the relevant stakeholders to masterplan the lands in
community ownership and seek funding to develop the overall lands, in line with future
funding calls.

9. Question submitted by Councillor Conway

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update on the footpath on the R506, between Abbeyowney and Murroe village.

REPLY:

It is a priority for Limerick City and County Council to extend the footpath between the
Abbeyowney Estate and Murroe. This infrastructure requires land acquisition to allow
for construction works with agreement not forthcoming at present.

Limerick City and County Council is also exploring the possibility of re-designating the
road a shared space with equal priority for all road users. The Cappamore-Kilmallock
Municipal District will be liaising with the Limerick Active Travel Office to determine if
this approach would be feasible to secure funding from the National Transport Authority
in the future.

10. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update as to when the EV Charging points installed in the Municipal District will be in use
to the public.

REPLY:

Limerick City & County Council are continuing to progress the cabling of the EV charge
points in conjunction with ESB Networks and are at the final procurement stages to
appoint a Charge Point Operator in the coming weeks to install and manage the units. It
is anticipated that chargers will be available at the pilot sites by Quarter 3 2025.

two local tributaries namely Athea West and East streams. He gave an update to the

Members on Fluvial 1% AEP Flood Mapping, Environmental Constraints Mapping and the

proposed scheme for Athea village. He outlined the locations of the three pumping stations

which were identified. He referred to Sediment Management which would involve the

periodic removal of excess gravel deposits in areas which are particularly hydraulically

sensitive for example at Athea Bridge. Mr. Reid also gave an update to the Members on

Public Realm Enhancement for the scheme.

He outlined the next steps in the project which included landowner liaison and finalising

number of matters including the pumping stations identified, sediment control, where

sediment is being taken to and the cost of the project.

In replying to the Members, Mr. Reid made reference to some of the biggest complexities in

the scheme including ground conditions and environmental sensitivity around the River

Galey. He stated that the planning application included for the removal of gravel from the

River Galey for the period of planning when it will be resurveyed again with ten years being

the anticipated timeframe for removal of sediment. He stated that it is proposed that the

Fisheries would use the sediment for river enhancement. In conclusion, Mr. Reid stated that

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the pedestrian access to the Greenway at***

***Galvin’s road, Templeglantine and at Murphy’s Bend.***

REPLY:

The two access points at Galvin’s road, Templeglantine and Murphy’s Bend (Doctors Bridge),

Abbeyfeale have been identified for closure following a road safety audit that was completed

as part of the Limerick Greenway project.

**Galvin’s Road**

The landowner at this location came forward and offered their lands to Limerick City and

County Council so as to maintain an access point that is safe at this location. The landowner

where the proposed access point is to be located was met on site in 2024 and there has been

telecoms with Limerick City and County Council in 2025 also. Drawings and maps are being

finalised at present and will then be shared with the landowner for final approval. The

tourism capital project team will make a funding submission for the works to TII.

**Murphy’s Bend/Doctor’s Bridge**

It is proposed to review what options are available, if any, to create an alternative safe access

point at this location. There are no funds available to purchase lands either by Limerick City

and County Council or TII. If a viable option is determined and lands are provided by

landowners then a submission for funding to TII can be made. If no option is available the

existing access point will have to be closed as per the road safety audit.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***for a full detailed report on (a) new graveyard in Abbeyfeale***

REPLY:

**(a)**

The Council have identified a site for a new burial ground in Abbeyfeale. The

acquisition of the site will be subject to planning permission being secured prior to the

legal acquisition of the site. The burial ground site will also accommodate car parking

to serve the Greenway hub in Abbeyfeale. In this regard, the Council have appointed

Consultants to progress both projects and the burial ground design is being progressed

for a Part 8 application. The Council would like to advise that negotiations cannot be

concluded until planning permission has been secured. In any event, the Part 8 is being

progressed in parallel with negotiations and therefore there is no delay in progressing

the burial ground project.

**(b)**

The project which is the Limerick Greenway Hub at Abbeyfeale has had Part 8 planning

since March 2024, planning reference 24/8000.

of the public in relation to the delivery of planning services. Therefore, in addressing

correspondence, it is necessary to have a central point of contact in order to ensure statutory

requirements are met and tracked. All queries are acknowledged as per the Customer Charter

and referred to the relevant administrative or case officer best suited to address the request.

Newcastle West Municipal District has an assigned District Planner, who is a key point of

contact for applicants and agents in the facilitation of the planning application process.

direct them to the appropriate person.

***how many have used the Greenway since it has opened.***

REPLY:

Limerick Greenway has already been a major success in terms of visitor numbers, business

growth and positive feedback from the public/tourists. While still an amenity, Limerick

Greenway has transformed West Limerick into an area that people want to visit and stay in

and base themselves from while touring the West of Ireland and exploring the WAW, with

the long-term goal being to create a reputable and enticing tourism destination.

Limerick City and County Council research has found that:



Almost nine out of ten Limerick Greenway users are now more physically active as a result

of the Greenway investment. 29% of the local community stated that they are “extremely

more active” due to the ease of access to Limerick Greenway for exercise.



Limerick Greenway use exceeds national recreational walking averages, compared to

national walking data reported in the Irish Sports Monitor.

Demesne in Newcastle West. It is estimated that funding for an automated

toilet would be of the order of €25,000 to €30,000 per annum including

servicing of the unit. Once a funding source is identified, consideration can be

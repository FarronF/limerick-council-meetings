The presentation was well received by the committee.

**Item 4: Changes in the various Grant Schemes i.e. Housing Adaptation Grants.**

Mr. Gerard McNamara, Senior Staff Officer, Housing, gave a presentation on the changes in the

various Grant Schemes.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Stephen Keary asked if the presentation could be circulated to Full

Council. It was agreed to make information available.

Ms. Mary Hayes, Senior Executive Officer gave an update on the work of the private grants team,

informing the members that the allocation for 2025 will be similar to that of last year and advised

that the Department have given Local Authorities advance notice that there will not be additional

funding available as was heretofore the case in previous years. There will be a need to manage

budgets accordingly and to ensure there is sufficient funding ring fenced for priority cases.

Cllr. Noreen Stokes welcomed the new changes, she queried how many times one may apply for the

grant and will applicants get a second grant if they re-apply. Mr. Ger McNamara, replied there

should generally be only one grant type for each household application.

Cllr. Stokes queried the word “Remote” contained on the form as it was causing confusion and

suggested the use of tick box only to make the form more user friendly.

Ms. Hayes replied, to contact the team if households had difficultly using forms and that they would

review the wording on the form.

Cllr. Francis Foley queried the removal of fossil fuel burners from the grant scheme and noted cases

of older persons who were hoping to get an oil boiler installed. Under the present scheme, new

boilers don’t qualify. Cllr. Foley with the support of Cllr. Keary recommended that a query go back to

the Department to query as required. Mr McNamara confirmed that there are alternatives and

advised there is a list available.

**On the proposal of Cllr. Francis Foley seconded by Cllr. Noreen Stokes it was agreed that under the**

**present scheme, a recommendation be sent to the DHLGH to accommodate the installation of**

**New Fossil Fuel Boilers.**

**Proposed:** Cllr. Francis Foley **Seconded:** Cllr. Noreen Stokes
---
Mr. McNamara went onto to give a brief overview of what the scheme provides grant assistance

towards.

Cllr. Abul Kalam Azad Talukder posed a question on housing adaptation grants for private properties

asking, do they need to be registered with the Rental Tenancies Board (RTB) and who is the

applicant for that grant, the landlord or tenant.

Mr. McNamara noted that landlords need to be registered with the RTB, the landlord needs to give

permission to the tenant to apply for the grant. Works will remain in place if the tenant moves on

from the property. There is nothing in the regulations once works have been done and if tenant

moves on (however this will be some provision of support under the RTB Notice period). Ms. Hayes

advised that the Housing Grants Team will query with DHLGH and get back to Councillors with an

update. Cllr. Keary also added there should be min of 5 years rental and a clawback so there is no

waste of tax payers’ money.

Cllr. Keary asked, are any changes on VAT claims for bathrooms/wetrooms. Mr. McNamara in reply

advised that there are no changes.

Cllr. Keary asked if an elderly couple living in the house that is owned by a son or daughter is their

income considered as the income for the grant.

Mr. McNamara in his reply stated that income taken into account is that of the homeowner. Ms.

Hayes added that there needs to be clarity who is the legal owner of the property that can apply for

the grant. Mr. Kennedy added this needs to be further clarified.

Cllr. Keary also asked if a husband and wife can apply separately, husband one year the wife the

following year?

Ms. Hayes replied the general advice from the DHLGH is one grant per household.

Cllr. Stokes queried the delays with using Occupational Therapists (OT) and asked do Limerick City

and County Council have an OT and asked if the team were aware there is a 3-month waiting list.

Ms. Hayes in reply regarding OTs advised that there is a panel in place of a list of OTs that are used at

the request of the applicant. If an applicant wants an OT the grants team can facilitate.

Cllr. Elisa O’Donovan supports Cllr. Stokes query and advised that she did request same in her last

council term, having a panel is very different to have an in-house OT. Ms. Hayes replied that they

would review the matter.

**Item 5: Update on Tenant Purchase Properties**

Ms. Mary Hayes, Senior Executive Officer, Housing, gave a presentation on Update on Tenant

Purchase Properties.

The presentation was well received by the committee.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Tommy O’Sullivan asked how many 1 bedroom apartments are

projected over next few years.
---
Ms. Sarah Newell, Senior Executive Officer replied that they are looking at the possibility of the

Hidden Homes Initiative in derelict properties Limerick City and County Council are acquiring and

converting to 1 and 2 beds, she advised she can give a note to the Metropolitain District on

projections in.

Cllr. Catherine Slattery asked for a projection of schemes and social housing over the next few years.

Ms. Hayes in reply, added she will follow up.

Cllr. O’Donovan asked have we the figures of the people in the city area who availed of the

Tenant in Situ scheme.

Ms. Newell clarified that we delivered circa. 100 with a mix of Approved Housing Bodies (AHB’s) and

LA acquired tenant in Situ.

Cllr. O’Donovan also asked for the number of Tenant Purchase applications and Ms. Hayes replied,

the figures are updated in the DG report. Re. Tenant Purchase, approved 46 applications and

received 71.

Cllr. Benson asked would it be an option to transfer tenants if unable to purchase property they are

currently in, Ms. Hayes in reply added that yes it is a possibility.

Ms. Newell also added that tenants may also avail of the New Build Incremental Tenant Purchase

Scheme.

Cllr. Keary asked regarding constituents looking to purchase a house and on social welfare. He stated

that it was unconstitutional that persons who are occupied in an AHB property will never own the

house. Ms Hayes added that this was to ensure good Tenure Mix and further clarified the Tenant

Purchase process.

Cllr. Benson asked is the Tenant Purchase Scheme the only method a person can purchase a house

or can they purchase outright if they don’t qualify. Ms. Hayes in reply stated that this is the only

mechanism available.

Cllr. Talukder queried the status of tenant in situ scheme. In response Ms. Newell added that there

are a number of houses on hold until we await details of new scheme.

Ms. Newell added that there was a webinar from the DHLGH regarding the new scheme and need to

await the budget, will prioritise on hold units from last year.

Cllr. Talukder asked how long this will take and Ms Newell replied we will circulate next week after

circular has been received.

clarification on the reply to members.

The future disposal of vacant/derelict residential properties is currently under review. A number of

cross-directorate meetings (between Housing and Property Management) have taken place

regarding such properties. Due to increased resources in the Housing Directorate and an evidential
---
housing need, it has been proposed that many more properties from this source will be taken by the

Housing Directorate to be made available under various schemes.

Cllr. O’Donovan added regarding residential homes, the derelict homes bought on the open market

have an no works completed and were the houses in the city and in need a lot of work are they

going to housing or on sale on open market to be used by first time buyers. Ms. Knox in reply added

that Housing will take those houses if there is a demand depending on condition of the property.

Cllr. Keary added that the properties would be sold to first time buyer with housing need and not to

a vulture fund and must show proof of funds that they can refurbish the property.

*We will move at the next Meeting if a recipient of carers allowance is living with elderly parents who*

*are in receipt of the old age pension, their carers allowance adds to the rent of the social house they*

*are living in. We believe that this should be addressed by the Elected Members and the extra charge*

*on the rent account that is now incurred should be removed as we consider this to be unfair and*

*unjust.*

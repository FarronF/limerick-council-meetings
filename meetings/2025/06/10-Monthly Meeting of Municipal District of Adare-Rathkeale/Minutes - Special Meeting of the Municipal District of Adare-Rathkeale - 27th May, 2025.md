**Social Housing in Pallaskenry**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing

Construction to the Meeting.

Councillor Teskey advised he was informed of an issue with the bond to deliver the

completion of the housing development at Main Street, Pallaskenry, Co. Limerick and

expressed concern the developer would put the houses up for public sale.

The Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing Construction advised she was

not aware of any issue with the bond and the Housing Department are currently working

through nominations for allocations to having tenants in situ as soon as practicable. The

developer is providing final documentation in relation to Collateral Warranties - a key

requirement to ensure drawdown from the Housing Finance Agency.

The Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing Construction further advised

the Housing Finance Agency are closed for a period in June and July which may affect

drawdown of funds to the developer to close the sale and therefore enable allocation.

An option of a short term licence was tabled to expedite allocations in advance of

Housing Finance Agency drawdown. Otherwise the allocations will have to await till the

file can be reviewed by the Housing Finance Agency in July.

Councillor Teskey advised he would like to have the houses occupied but stated he

wished to distance himself from the Licence Agreement element. It was noted in any

case that this is an executive function.

Councillor Hartigan advised the entrance to the estate is dangerous and needs to be

addressed. The Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing Construction

advised the scheme is required to be taken in charge and the developer will be
---
responsible for making the entrance safe in accordance with the conditions of the

planning application.

Members requested a detailed programme on outstanding works (TIC, ESB etc). The

Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing Construction agreed to revert.

Councillor Hartigan queried if Councillors could make contact with the National School in

Pallaskenry to advise them of the age category of the tenants due to occupy the houses

prior to their school closure in June so the school can plan for the extra students that

will attend in the new school term. The Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA

Housing Construction agreed to revert with the age pattern of the children due to

occupy the houses.

Members requested the Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing

Construction would attend the July Municipal District Meeting to provide a further

update on the progress of the development. The Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and

Non LA Housing Construction advised she would attend the July Municipal District

Meeting with a representative from Focus Ireland to update Members in relation to the

development and the drawdown of funds from the Housing Finance Agency. Members

requested the Director of Service, Housing and the Mayor of Limerick also be in

attendance.

This concluded the Meeting.

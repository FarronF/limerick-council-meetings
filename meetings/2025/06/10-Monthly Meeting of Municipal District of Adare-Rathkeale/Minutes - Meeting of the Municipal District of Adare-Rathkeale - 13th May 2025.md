Mr. Murphy gave Members a brief outline of the background to the educational facilities

provided at St. Mary’s National School. He advised the school currently does not have an

assembly centre and access to sports amenities. He also outlined concerns in relation to

access to the school and advised he had met with officials from Limerick City and County

Council who informed him it would not be possible to upgrade the existing entrance to

the school and alternative access would have to be found.

Ms. O’Dea, Parents Association and Board of Management Member, informed Members

40 metres of roadway is required from the current road infrastructure adjacent to the

school property, however, the Department of Education have advised the Board of

Management that they can only fund works associated with the school and boundary and

not road access to the school. Ms. O’Dea advised Limerick and Clare Education and

Training Board (LCETB) have generously donated a site to allow a safe access road to the

school, however, she was of the opinion Limerick City and County Council have a duty of

care to provide safe access for all to the school.

Mr. Murphy concluded by asking all Members to advocate and support the Board of

Managements request to fund the construction of a new entrance for the safety of the

staff and children of Croom National School.

Discussion ensued and Members advised they were unanimous in supporting this project.

Councillor Keary added however the onus is on the Department of Education to provide

safety measures for all entering the school adding the Minister for Education has a role in

providing the remaining funding to deliver this project.

The A/Senior Executive Officer, Municipal Districts advised Vincent Murray, Director of

Service, Planning and Place-Making was unable to attend the Meeting and read the

following on his behalf into the record of the Meeting:

*“**I refer to Notice of Motion that has been submitted to the Council by Cllr. John*

*O’Donoghue in relation to CROOM DISTRIBUTOR ROAD* *- Camoge Park to rear of extended*

*boundary Croom National School and would advise you of the following additional*

*information in relation to the information provided in the Notice of Motion response.*

*In relation to the next section of new distributor road, I have had meetings with the school*

*principal Emmett Murphy and Councillors in relation to this proposed section of road of*

*circa 50 odd metres that the school needs to permit them to commence construction on a*

*large extension at the rear of the existing Croom National School. This section of roads*

*also open up the adjoining lands that are currently zoned community.*

*· There is a large school extension and upgrade works proposed to Croom National*

*School of circa €5m.*

*· Significant lands have been acquired and have been transferred from the ETB to the*

*Board of Management of the school to facilitate this new extension and upgrade*

*works.*

*· I am advised that the developer who owns the land where this short section of road is*

*proposed to be constructed has agreed in principle to consent to the construction of*

*the road on his lands or to transfer this land free of charge so that the road can be*

*constructed.*

*In relation to the funding to build the road I have spoken with Active Travel and this road*

*is not eligible for safe routes to school funding in 2025, however they have indicated that*

*they would be open to put in an application in 2026 to cover the cost of the active travel*

*elements (Footpaths & Cyclepaths).*

*This section of road would provide a direct access between the National School and the*

*new Secondary School the as well as all the new adjacent housing and lead to a significant*

*reduction in travel for school trips.*

*I have asked Active Travel to provide a costing for the construction of this road and they*

*have estimated a cost of circa €300,000 to €350,000 for this short section of road.*

*I am currently examining how this section of road can be funded and whilst no funding is*

*currently confirmed, I am hoping that it may be funded from a combination of sources*

*including;*

*1. A contribution from Active Travel towards the provision of pedestrian and cycle*

*facilities on the road for safe access to school (2026)*

*2. A contribution from the new Development Contribution Scheme 2025-2030. (Maybe*

*over 2 years)*

*3. A contribution from the Department of Education (The school has advised that*

*currently there is no money available from the Dept. of Education so this may not*

*happen, however it should be noted they are making a huge contribution to Croom*

*with circa a €5m investment at the school)*

*I will move to bring a Memo to Management Board with The Transport Director to support*

*the construction of this section of road to provide access to the rear of the national school*

*which will allow the school to make a positive decision to move ahead with a planning*

*application. In this regard and with the support of Management Board we can provide a*

*letter to the school to support their planning application once funding is agreed.*

*This would be subject also to getting confirmation that the land for the road will be made*

*available at no cost.*

*NOTE:*

*A number of people have identified that the remainder of the Distributor Road should be*

*developer led, there is a current issue in Croom with Waste Water Treatment Capacity at*

*the Waste water Treatment Plant and Uisce Éireann will not consent to any additional*

*large scale housing developments until the plant has been upgraded**”**.*

**Briefing from Tusla on the fostering process**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Ms. Jeanette Seymour from Tusla to the Meeting. Ms.

Seymour gave Members a presentation on the fostering process advising foster carers are

urgently required for all aspects of fostering as there are over 6,000 children currently in

foster care in Ireland and over 3,000 foster carers. She advised Tusla foster carers are

diverse and come from all walks of life and must possess the qualities and skills that can

make a real difference to a child’s life, giving them a safe and loving home.

Ms. Seymour concluded advising anyone who wishes to become a foster carer can

complete an application form on the Tusla website. Once they submit an application form

they will undergo an assessment to determine their suitability, this will include

background checks and an interview. All applicants are then required to complete a

foster induction course and training program prior to being approved as a foster carer.

She advised applicants can apply on www.fostering.ie or by phoning 1800 226 771.

Councillor Teskey thanked Ms. Seymour for her presentation adding the fostering process

is a huge success in Ireland and concluded by asking if Ms. Seymour could advise the Tusla

agency that Members have been unsuccessful in meeting with them to discuss the

behaviour of children under the age of 18 in the town of Rathkeale during the Christmas

period. Ms. Seymour agreed to take the request back to the Department dealing with

these issues adding Members also needed to contact An Garda Síochána to discuss their

concerns.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting that we write to the Department of Transport and ask**

**that anyone using an e-scooter or an e-bike in a public place should hold a valid theory**

**test that displays their knowledge on the rules of the road.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Teskey

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion Councillor O’Donoghue noted these modes of transport are

designed with good intentions however some users appear to not have sufficient

knowledge of the rules of the road to operate them safely, therefore, users should be

required to take a valid theory test and be licenced to operate same.
---

**REPLY:**

The concern for road safety is noted, especially with the increasing use of

e-scooters and e-bikes. While encouraging better understanding of the

rules of the road is a positive step, we would like to raise a few points for

consideration.

Firstly, the enforcement of e-scooter/e-bike user behaviour in a public

place is a matter for An Garda Síochána.

Secondly, the practicality of requiring all e-scooter and e-bike users to

pass a theory test could present enforcement challenges, especially given

the casual and spontaneous way many people use these modes of

transport. It may also disproportionately affect those who rely on these

affordable and sustainable options for commuting or short distance travel.

Finally, current legislation already treats many e-scooters as vehicles

requiring insurance and licensing, though enforcement varies. Perhaps in

tandem with / instead of introducing a new requirement for a theory test,

we could advocate for better education campaigns and clearer guidance

from the Department of Transport.

We would support a motion that encourages the Department to improve

public awareness of the rules of the road for these vehicles, but would

caution the introduction of regulatory burdens that may not be practical

to implement.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next Meeting given the fact the Council has honoured its obligations**

**with the Department of Social Protection in its two year contract at Bank of Ireland,**

**this premises be offered now for use in the provision of Library Services in Askeaton.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor Keary and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey requested the District write to Sonja Reidy,

Senior Executive Officer, Limerick Metropolitan District requesting she communicate

with the Property Department to transfer the use of the Bank of Ireland building in

Askeaton to Limerick City and County Council’s Library Services when it becomes vacant

later in the year.

Following discussion Councillor Teskey requested the relevant staff dealing with the

retrofit for both the Bank of Ireland in Askeaton and Rathkeale attend a future meeting

of the District to discuss their future uses. The A/Senior Executive Officer, Municipal

Districts agreed to follow up and revert to Members in due course.

**REPLY:**

The Carnegie Library in Askeaton cannot offer an expanded library service

on its current site. Accommodating a full passenger lift to the vacant

second floor is not possible. Therefore, universal public access, which is

essential for the Public Library Service, is not achievable.

The former Bank of Ireland building could provide an enhanced library offer.

a. In terms of location, the bank site has more prominence, is move visible and

accessible than the Carnegie Library.

b. It is within walking distance to pre-schools, primary and secondary schools.

c. It has secure gated grounds, allowing opportunities for outdoor Library activities.

d. It is a well-maintained building, with an open plan ground floor enabling universal

access. It has ample area on the ground floor to accommodate modern library

facilities and functions with an existing disability access ramp at the entrance

door.

The upgrade of the building completed in the last two years has enhanced its potential

as a Library, after its use by Social Protection. However, if the building were to become

available, its adaptation and fit-out as a modern public library would be subject to

capital funding from the Department of Social Protection; and Rural and Community

Development and the Gaeltacht.

**11.**

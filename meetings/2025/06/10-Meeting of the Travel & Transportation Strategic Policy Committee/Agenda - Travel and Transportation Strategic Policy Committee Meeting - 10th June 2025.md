***Note: The full delivery of the Greenway - from Rathkeale to Limerick City - should*

*be the primary objective given the substantial economic, social, and tourism*

*benefits to the region. If this cannot be achieved within the timeline, then at*

*minimum, the section from* ***Limerick City to Adare*** *should be completed before*

*the Ryder Cup, to align with the completion of the Adare Bypass and ensure*

*sustainable transport options for the event.*

*This motion is proposed in recognition of the opportunity to maximise national*

*and international benefit from the project in the lead-up to 2027.*

**9.Question submitted by Mr. F. Flaherty, Community/Voluntary Sector**

I will ask at the next meeting can the Roads Design Office provide a detailed update

on the current status and progress of the Rathkeale to Limerick City Greenway project,

including milestones completed to date, current stage of planning or design,

estimated timelines for construction, and any obstacles that may impact the project's

delivery ahead of the 2027 Ryder Cup.

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to the

Meeting and the Questions were therefore taken as having been dealt with.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting that a speed survey be undertaken on the R520 through***

***Ardagh Village.***

REPLY:

A speed survey can be carried out but traffic calming measures are already in

place within Ardagh Village.

10.Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting what, if any horse control measures, are expected to be***

***implemented in Newcastle West town.***

REPLY:

The Veterinary Services Department enforces the Control of Horses Act 1996 and the related

Bye-Laws in Limerick. The entire City and County of Limerick is designated a Control Area

under this legislation. It is an offence to allow a horse to stray in a public area, or to keep a

horse within the curtilage of a dwelling.

There is no bespoke plan in place for horse control in Newcastle West town. Veterinary

Services responds to reports from the public of straying horses wherever they arise within the

Control Area, and deploys the Pound service accordingly. So far in 2025, we have seized two

horses in the Newcastle West Municipal District, albeit not from the town. Horses are held in

the Pound for five days and, if not reclaimed, rehomed to a horse charity outside Limerick.

Persons concerned about straying horses in any locality should be advised to contact

Customer Services and the matter will be investigated by Veterinary Services staff.

approval and the provision of funding by TII.

Councillor Foley referred to potholes on the Killarney Road from the Fire Station to Dalton’s

**QUESTIONS**

**4.Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, Limerick has the second-***

***highest proportion of personal injury claims with 6.2%, second only to Dublin.***

***How many personal injury claims were made against Limerick City and County Council in 2023***

***and 2024;***

***How many of these personal injury claims related to the Limerick Metropolitan area in 2023 and***

***2024;***

***How many of these personal injury claims related to the O Connell Street area in Limerick in 2023***

***and 2024;***

***In the cases litigated in Court relating to personal injury claims in the O Connell Street area in***

***2023 and 2024 was there a finding of underlying cause and if so, what was the finding.***

**REPLY**: All personal injury claims are managed on the Councils’ behalf by I.P.B. Insurance.

The Member Quarterly Management Claims Trend Report for Quarter 4 2024 attached

provides full details on all personal injury claims for the period 2022-2024.

The level of detail requested above is not available from the I.P.B. system.

The report gives a breakdown of the different cause trends across all claim types.

Detailed information on individual judgements are not available.

The Member Quarterly Management Claims Trend Report for Quarter 4 2024 was circulated as

part of the reply.

**5.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council has actually***

***ever appointed consultants for the extension of the Castleconnell Playground as indicated in***

***September last year and if the €20,000 development levies allocation towards the consultants***

***has been spent.***

**REPLY**: The Council wishes to advise that sourcing funding for the construction of the Castleconnell

playground is proving very difficult. A funding application to the Community Recognition

Fund for Castleconnell playground was unsuccessful. As a result, the Council are making

every effort to retain funding where possible for the construction phase. As additional

resources have been provided to the Parks department, the project is now being progressed

inhouse; the €20,000 funding is still available for the Castleconnell project.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council has yet***

***identified an alternative way to deliver the Kilmurry Columbarium Garden Wall and provide a***

***timeline for the construction stage.***

**REPLY**: The Council has identified an alternative way of delivering the Kilmurray Columbarian

Garden. The Council investigated whether Monumental Sculptors could deliver the

hardscaping and civil elements of the projects, while the Parks department could assist with

the landscaping elements of the project. It appears that a number of the Monumental
---
7

Sculptors can deliver the hardscaping elements in addition to the provision of the

Columbarian Walls.

The Council proceeded to tender for the hardscaping and Columbarian walls. It is expected

that the contractor will be appointed in the next two weeks and construction works are

expected to commence in June/July of this year. The lead in time for the delivery

Columbarian walls is not known at this present moment in time.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many applicants are***

***currently on the housing waiting list in the Metropolitan area and length of time on the list.***

**REPLY**: The total number of approved applicants on Limerick City and County Council’s Housing

Waiting List that have chosen the Metropolitan District as an Area of Choice is 2,424 no. It

should be noted that not all applicants may reside in the Metropolitan District.

Breakdown in table below:

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if this Council has applied***

***for funding for a bus shelter and seating at bus stop 607891 on the Mulcair Road, Dooradoyle.***

**REPLY**: Bus Stop 607891 on the Mulcair Road which serves the current 304 bus route is not included

in the revised Bus Connects Redesign. Going forward, priority for bus shelters is given to the

proposed routes as part of the Bus Connects Redesign and will primarily have regard for the

frequency of route, nearest existing shelter, proximity to populous feeders (Schools,

hospital, urban Centers etc.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the number of applicants***

***for the Historic Structures Fund in 2024 and the number of successful applicants, including a***

***breakdown of use for residential or community use, and if located in the Metropolitan area.***

**REPLY**: A total of 22 no. applications were received for the Historic Structures Fund in 2024.

Of these, 7 no. projects were shortlisted and forwarded to the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage for consideration.

3 no. projects were offered funding by the Department – one private residence, and two

public/community buildings. One of the three successful projects was located in the
---
8

Metropolitan area.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can the Council advise in a***

***case of animal cruelty where an animal is left for weeks in terrible conditions, whose jurisdiction***

***is it to seize the dogs and place them in a safe environment. Can the Council also advise when***

***the animal is seized who pays for the animals**care and where is the animal placed.***

**REPLY**: Under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, 2013, the Department of Agriculture, Food and

the Marine (DAFM) has primary policy responsibility for the welfare of all animals. Since the

introduction of the Act, over 1,000 Department officials have been designated as

authorised officers under the Act and their responsibilities include the enforcement of

animal welfare legislation provided for under the Act. DAFM authorised officers in Limerick

are based in the Limerick Regional Veterinary Office. An Garda Síochána are also authorised

officers under the Act. The Department can recover the costs associated with housing a

seized animal as part of legal proceedings following a seizure.

The Council do not seize animals under the Animal Health and Welfare Act.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the Bike***

***Scheme that was trialled in Annacotty/Castletroy area in the last few years.***

**REPLY**: The dockless bike share pilot scheme which was operated by Tier-Dott concluded in

December 2024. Tier-Dott have since ceased operations in Ireland.

The TFI Bike Share scheme operating across Limerick City is not affected by the conclusion

of the pilot dockless scheme. The National Transport Authority has advised that the

operation of the TFI Bike Share scheme is expected to be re-tendered later this year.

Limerick City and County Council is working with the NTA to define an expanded

geographical operating area for the TFI Bike Share scheme. We do not currently have a

timeline for the roll out of the expanded scheme.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask a**t the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what*** ***the Director of***

***Housing’s plans are to curtail the completely disproportionate purchasing of new build houses in***

***Limerick City by Approved Housing Bodies and other entities supported by the State.***

**REPLY**: We acknowledge the findings of the recent Limerick Chamber report - 'Mid-West

Economic Insights 2025', which identified that 57% of residential property purchases in

Limerick in 2023 were made by non-household entities for all tenures - private and

affordable not just social housing. This was a matter of significant concern, particularly in

the context of maintaining an appropriate balance in housing tenure.

We note, however, that this figure has reduced substantially to 32.4% in 2024 - well

below the national average of 36.5% in the same year. This positive development is
---
9

attributed to the Council’s proactive implementation of a tenure mix policy developed

with the Elected Members aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance between social

rental, affordable purchase, cost rental and private market housing.

Further planning safeguards are also in place under the Ministerial Guidelines issued by

the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in July 2023 - Regulation of

Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing - Guidelines for Planning Authorities.

These statutory guidelines direct planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to apply

specific planning conditions in relation to residential developments comprising five or

more houses and/or duplex units. The purpose of these conditions is to prevent the bulk

purchase of new own-door housing by commercial institutional investors, thereby

protecting opportunities for individual purchasers and the delivery of social and

affordable housing, including cost-rental models.

The impact of both the local tenure policy and these national planning safeguards is

reflected in the reduction of non-household acquisitions in 2024, and the Council remains

committed to monitoring and managing tenure mix to support a balanced and inclusive

housing market.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many fines for dog***

***fouling were issued by Limerick Council in the Metropolitan District of Limerick in 2023 and 2024***

***and how much revenue was collected as a result.***

**REPLY:**

**2023**

**2024**

3 Dog Fouling fines issued

1 Dog Fouling fine issued

Revenue Collected €0.00

1 Court proceedings have been

initiated

2 Withdrawn

Revenue Collected €0.00

1 Court proceedings have been

initiated.

Under Section 22 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 it is an offence to allow a dog under your

control to foul a public place. A Litter/ Dog Warden can issue a fixed penalty fine for dog

fouling under the Act, however the burden of proof is high. Prosecutions can be difficult as

the Litter or Dog Warden must witness the incident and the dog must be connected to a

person at the time of the offense. Where member of the public reports an instance they

must be willing to give evidence in court, however many are reluctant to do so.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***proposed bus shelter planned for the Old Cratloe Road. Is it still proposed to be moved closer to***

***Caherdavin Meadows Junction rather than the bus stop’s current location.***
---
10

**REPLY**: A bus shelter is proposed for this stop as part of the Old Cratloe Road Active Travel Scheme.

In order to facilitate a bus shelter, it is proposed to move the bus stop closer to Caherdavin

Meadows junction. The Old Cratloe Road Active Travel Scheme is anticipated to go through

the Section 38 process in Q3 of 2025, with construction also anticipated in Q3 of 2025

subject to NTA approval.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what steps are typically***

***taken by Limerick City and County Council to engage with owners of vacant and derelict***

***buildings, in the Metropolitan area, to bring them back to occupation.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council takes a pro-active, place-based approach to identifying

and activating derelict sites and vacant homes for more beneficial uses in local

communities. The Council operates the activation programme under a number of

Government policies, in particular: Housing For All, Town Centre First, Our Rural Future, and

statutory legislation of the Derelict Sites Act 1990, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act

2015, and the Housing Act 1966. 

The Council also administers the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant on behalf of the

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Owners of derelict and vacant

properties can benefit from grants of up to €70,000 either to refurbish their property for

occupation as a principal private residence or to make it available to the private rental

market.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what the number of units***

***is in the city centre, across all social housing sectors including AHBs, LCCC-owned housing and***

***HAP Rentals.***

**REPLY**:

In order to determine the number of units in the City Centre, the Housing Directorate has used the

City Centre zoning boundary Map in the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 as the basis for

assessing the number of units in the City Centre. The map was extrapolated to Electoral Division

data which makes it easy for the Council databases to assess the level of social-rental households.

The total at this time is 2,331 social-rental/supported homes (25% of total residential homes).

The Council remains committed to monitoring and managing tenure mix to support a balanced and

inclusive housing market in the city, with the support of Elected Members.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***progress with the Columbarium Wall in Mount St. Lawrence.***

**REPLY**: The Council had previously received quotations for Consultants for the Columbarian Garden

for Mount Saint Lawrence Cemetery. The Council have amended requirements for the

project and are retendering on etenders for Consultants to design and deliver the project.

The previous preliminary design is being simplified in order to achieve better value for

money.

It is anticipated that a Part 8 will be lodged by October of this year.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**18.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Doyle (to be referred to the Economic**

**Development, Enterprise, Tourism and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***units*** ***like one year’s rates exempt for new retail premises and penalties for owners of vacant***

***retail premises that have been idle for over two years.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise, Tourism and
---

Planning Strategic Policy Committee.

**19.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council liaise with Government with a view to establishing a Driving Test Centre in***

***Castletroy/Annacotty to help alleviate the long wait times for tests.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan, seconded by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Gavan highlighted the long waiting times for tests and

emphasised the urgent need to introduce measures to reduce them.

**20.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council calls on Government to provide sufficient funding to allow the Council to honour***

***its housing commitments and to allow the Tenant In Situ scheme to function as was previously***

***established.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Gavan stressed that significant funding was needed for

housing, in particular with the reduction in funding for the tenant in situ scheme which was a very

successful initiative, and with the ongoing housing crisis.

**21.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council give***

***consideration to the provision of a community park in the Singland/Bloodmill area of Limerick.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Pond and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted the lack of community facilities in the area,

which had a large population, and emphasised the importance of providing sporting and other

essential services to support these communities.

**REPLY**: The Environment Department are in the process of engaging an Ecologist to undertake a full

ecological assessment of the Groody Valley Area. This is part of an overall process to

determine the suitability of this land for interventions where appropriate. The members

will be kept up to date on progress.

Councillor Slattery expressed disappointment with the response, noting that the proposed location

of Groody Valley area for a community park was not suitable for the people living in the

Singland/Boodmill area of Limerick. She emphasised the need to identify a more suitable location

closer to these communities in Singland/Bloodmill.

**22.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for this Council to look at***

***providing free parking permits to Health Care Workers who provide home support to people who***

***live in the City with parking restrictions outside their homes.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with the Cluid Housing Approved Body to examine what measures can be***

***taken, including blocking access from the Greenway, to alleviate the anti-social behaviour that is***

***occurring at both Apartment Blocks in Newtown Meadows in Castletroy.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor Slattery and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Pond referred to a number of emails he had received from

residents in Newtown Meadows outlining issues of anti-social behaviour in their area.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Road’s Department will engage on this issue raised

through the Planning department during the taking in charge process of Newtown

Meadows.

**Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing.**

With regards to anti-social behaviour at the Apartment Blocks in Newtown Meadows, it is

crucial to address the concerns of residents while also considering the broader community

that utilises the Greenway.

I would like to emphasise that anti-social behaviour is being actively addressed by An Garda

Síochána, who are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all citizens. The

Greenway serves as a valuable resource for walkers, cyclists, and families, promoting

healthy outdoor activities and community engagement.

While exploring potential measures to mitigate the issues faced by residents, we must

balance these actions with the accessibility of the Greenway, which many people enjoy.

Engaging with Clúid Housing through Limerick City and County Councils Housing Dept. to

discuss practical solutions is a positive step and I encourage collaborative efforts to find a

resolution that addresses the concerns of both the residents and the wider community.

**A/Senior Engineer, Active Travel.**

The provision of CCTV on the Greenways in the Castletroy Area is currently being considered

by the GDPR team.

**A/Senior Engineer, Travel & Transport Strategy.**
---
15

Members supported the Motion and highlighted the need for increased Garda resources in the

area and the provision of CCTV on the Greenway.

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

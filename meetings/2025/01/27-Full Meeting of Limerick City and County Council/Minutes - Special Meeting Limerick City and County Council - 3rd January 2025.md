The Príomh Chomhairleoir thanked everybody for attending the Special Meeting, explaining

that it was being held in order to pass a Vote of Sympathy for former Mayor of Limerick, Mr.

Ger Fahy, who had sadly passed away. Deep sympathy was expressed to his family and to his

friends, neighbours and community, for their loss.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir stated that Ger was a former Fine Gael Councillor and former

Mayor of Limerick, who leaves behind a legacy of dedication to his community. Born on

October 24, 1953, in Marian Avenue, Janesboro, Ger's life was deeply connected to the heart

of Limerick. He was educated at Janesboro National School and CBS Sexton Street, and then

began a career in hospitality that was more than just a job, it was Ger’s way of connecting

with the people of Limerick. Ger worked at the Mill Tavern (now Dolans) and later at the

Spotted Dog Bar, where he got to know the community inside and out. He used these

experiences to dive into public life and offered his service to the community.

He stated that Ger’s political journey began in 1985 when he was elected as a Fine Gael

councillor. Even after some setbacks, Ger's determination saw him regain his seat in 1999,

showing just how much his constituents trusted and respected him. In 2007, Ger hit the

peak of his political career when he was elected the 811th Mayor of Limerick, a role he

absolutely loved and called the highlight of his political life. But Ger wasn't just about

politics, he was devoted to his loving wife Maura who sadly passed away in February of last

year. May she rest in peace.

Ger also helped found the Limerick Marine, Search and Rescue Service and was a huge

supporter of local sports, with lifelong ties to Janesboro FC and Old Christians GAA Club.

Ger’s legacy is one of leadership, compassion, and pride in Limerick. He will be deeply

missed but fondly remembered by everyone who had the privilege to know him.

Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. They said that Ger was a very

wise, kind man who went about his business in a quiet manner and was instrumental in

guiding and helping some Members of the Council get into politics. Ger was a man of

integrity, was honest, had great wisdom and was hardworking and very generous with his

time and energy. They recalled that he had a great affection for the elderly and the friends

of the elderly and had the unique ability to be respected across all political parties. Members

remembered him as a man who always wanted to co-operate and build bridges and was very

committed to the people of Janesboro and beyond, he was a thorough gentleman who bore

his illness with great dignity over the last fourteen years.

The Director General, on behalf of Management and staff, paid tribute to the late Ger Fahy

and expressed his condolences to his family, community and friends. He remembered him as

a very engaging and generous person who had a great love and commitment to his local area.

Ger was a very practical politician who brought passion to his work and used his humour very

effectively.

Mayor Moran joined with the previous speakers in extending condolences on the death of

Ger. He noted that projects which had commenced while Ger was a councillor are now

coming to fruition in Limerick. His final meeting with Ger was in St. Camillus Hospital where

he placed the Mayor’s chain of office on Ger for the very last time and said it was a lovely

moment to share.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Príomh Chomhairleoir held a minute's silence and

reflection as a mark of respect.

Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

This concluded the Meeting.

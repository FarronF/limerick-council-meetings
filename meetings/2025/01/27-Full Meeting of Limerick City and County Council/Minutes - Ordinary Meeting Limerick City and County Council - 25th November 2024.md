target.

Once the backlog is under control, we will be implementing the performance

criteria which is outlined within the contract where ESL have 10 working days

to repair a reported fault. If the fault is not repaired in 10 working days, ESL

shall incur a penalty where the repair is within their control (e.g. non-

infrastructure related).

Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

***I will ask at the next Meeting why did Limerick City and County Council not provide an in-***

***person ceremony to switch on the Christmas lights in Limerick City.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has programmed a number of Christmas

events, throughout December, organised for Limerick for Christmas 2024,

including LUXE Christmas Procession on 1st December, 2024, Cruises Street

seasonal street shows, Christmas Couture in the Castle and many other events.

It was decided that there would be no switch-on event for Christmas 2024.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the procurement and installation of specific***

***dog waste bins across Limerick as I have been asked about this on numerous occasions by***

***residents.***---
14

**REPLY:**

The Cleansing Section operates a system of ‘any bag, any bin’ for dog waste in

Limerick City, meaning bagged dog waste can be placed in any general litter

bin. Requests for litter bins at specific locations are considered following an

assessment of the area in question.

Prior to bin installation, consideration is given to the following: (i) the proximity

of existing litter bins; (ii) suitable locations where a bin can be serviced by

Cleansing Section bin collection vehicles; (iii) the observed need for a litter bin

based on the presence of litter; (iv) the likelihood of increased litter in the

vicinity of a bin arising from misuse of bins, e.g. dumping of domestic waste in

or adjacent to litter bins (this will also be reassessed after any new bins are

installed); (v) the need to provide bins to cater for a significant demand to

dispose of dog waste on routes where dog walking is prevalent.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

***I will ask at the next Meeting what the projected budget for Riverfest 2025 is and what***

***percentage of the overall Festival and Events 2025 budget Riverfest will absorb.***

**REPLY:**

The projected budget for Riverfest 2025 is subject to approval by the Members

at their Budget Meeting and therefore no accurate budget figures are currently

available.

16.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

**I will ask at the next Meeting what policies, personnel and resources are in place to deal**

**with dereliction and vacancy across Limerick City and Limerick County.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council takes a proactive, place-based approach to

identifying and activating derelict sites and vacant homes in local communities

for more beneficial uses. The Council operates this activation programme

under a number of Government policies, in particular: Housing For All, Town

Centre First, Our Rural Future, and statutory legislation of the Derelict Sites Act

1990, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, and the Housing Act,

1966.

Key local plans guiding the approach include the Limerick Development Plan

2022-2028 and the Mayoral Programme: More for Limerick 2024-2029.

The multi-disciplinary Vacancy and Dereliction Unit is located in the Property

Management Services Department of the Rural, Culture, Community and

Tourism Development Directorate and comprises 11 staff in total – six

administration and five technical.

The Unit deals with derelict sites, vacant homes and vacant sites across all the

Municipal Districts. It advises and guides owners of unproductive properties---
15

on the various supports available to bring their properties back to more

beneficial uses.

The Council operates the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF)

– Call 3 Fund of €9 million in the Limerick City Centre and €1 million in

Newcastle West town area which supports a programme of building

acquisition by the Council to return them to use through the market with new

private owners to accelerate the provision of residential accommodation.

Also administered by the Unit is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant

which enables owners of derelict and vacant properties to benefit from grants

of up to €70,000 to refurbish them for occupation as a principal private

residence or to make available to the private rental market.

NOTICES OF MOTION

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to the Minister for Education urging***

***her to scrap plans to spend €9 million on mobile phone pouches and to allocate this funding***

***instead to special education provision.***

With the permission of the Meeting and at the request of Councillor Benson, this

Notice of Motion was withdrawn.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to the Minister for Health and***

***Taoiseach to ask them to intervene to ensure that the specialist nursing vacancies are filled***

***in the University Hospital Limerick Oncology Department as soon as possible.***

Councillor Leddin moved the Motion on Councillor Sheehan’s behalf. The Motion was

seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon and adopted.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors J. Scanlan and E. Ryan

***We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister***

***for Transport to remove the condition that a secondary land holding of one hectare***

***minimum should apply to enable qualification for the Local Improvement Scheme.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Scanlan, seconded by Councillor Sheahan and

adopted.

In moving the Motion Councillor Scanlan outlined his disappointment that two

landowners were still required to enable qualification for Scheme. He emphasised that it was

a big issue for people living in areas with roadways badly in need of improvement, and

stressed the importance of removing this condition to allow more people apply.---
16

It was agreed to write to the Minister for Rural and Community Development.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

**I will move at the next Meeting for a variation to the Limerick Development Plan to add the**

**following to Chapter 11 Development Management Standards, 11.7.2.1 Wind Energy: "In**

**addition to the above, the following local considerations will be taken into account by the**

**Council in relation to any planning application;**



**Impact on human health in relation to noise disturbance (including consistency with the**

**Word Health Organisations 2018 Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European**

**Region), shadow flicker and air quality."**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue

and adopted.

In moving the Motion Councillor Teskey outlined the impact wind turbines can have

on human health, and emphasised the importance of applying consistency across all wind

farms in Limerick. He referred to the current government guidelines, and stressed the

importance of bringing these guidelines and regulations up to date and in line with the World

Health Organisation’s advice.

Members welcomed the Motion and agreed new guidelines were required to ensure

assessment of wind farm planning applications is carried out in line with World Health

Organisation’s noise guidelines, and stressed this was important to avoid possible health

issues for people living near Wind Farms.

**REPLY:**

It is not considered necessary to vary the Limerick Development Plan as the

Plan currently includes an extensive list of aspects to be considered during the

planning assessment of any planning application for wind energy, including

noise and shadow flicker. These assessments are also required as part of any

Environmental Impact Assessment that would be submitted with any planning

application. Limerick City and County Council requires a lower fixed noise limit

for night that is below that set out in the 2006 Wind Energy Development

Guidelines for Planning Authorities. It would be unreasonable to include a

requirement that planning applications be consistent with the World Health

Organisation’s 2018 Environmental Noise Guidelines for wind turbine noise as

compliance cannot be tested and therefore not enforceable.

Following discussions, Members queried if a variation to the Limerick Development

Plan could be moved and what was required to carry the Motion.

In response to the Members’ queries, the Director of Planning and Place-Making

advised the Meeting the Planning Department operate under current 2006 Wind Energy

Development Guidelines, and advised a review of the current guidelines was underway to---
17

address key aspects, including noise. This review included a public consultation but he noted

the guidelines were not finalised yet by the Department.

The Director advised that a variation of the Limerick Development Plan comes under

Section 13 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and that the Members

of a Planning Authority may at any time, for stated reasons, submit a resolution to the Mayor

of the Planning Authority, requesting him to prepare a report on a proposal by them to initiate

a process to consider the variation of the Development Plan where three-quarters of the

Members of the Authority have approved such resolution.

It was agreed that further discussions would take place on this matter with the Mayor,

Members and the Executive.

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Beasley

***I will move at the next Meeting that communication take place with the Ministers***

***responsible for animal welfare regarding the request from Limerick City and County Council***

***for a six-month amnesty for XL Bully dogs that are being surrendered to local animal welfare***

***charities. This amnesty would facilitate the rehoming of these dogs to other countries, such***

***as Italy and Sweden.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Beasley and seconded by Councillor Hartigan

(T).

Following some discussion, at the request of Councillor Beasley and with the

permission of the Meeting, the Motion was withdrawn.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

***I will move at the next Meeting that we run a Limerick-wide campaign to highlight the***

***importance of Men’s Mental Health**through engaging with sports organisations, men’s***

***sheds, schools, and other organisations to promote connection and a sense of belonging in***

***our city and county.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara, seconded by Councillor

Donoghue, and adopted.

In moving the Motion Councillor Hickey-O’Mara emphasised the importance of Men’s

Mental Health and highlighted the need to encourage more men to talk about mental health

issues. He stressed the importance of supporting community organisations currently helping

men to engage, and asked the Council to consider running a campaign to promote more

participation amongst men.

Members fully supported the Motion and thanked Councillor Hickey-O’Mara for

bringing it forward. The Members outlined the need to encourage more men to engage in

various community based organisations that provide a space where men feel included and---
18

safe. They stressed the importance of this matter, outlining how supporting these

organisations will assist men to reach out and seek help as early as possible.

The Mayor acknowledged the need for leadership on men’s mental health within

Limerick City and County; outlining that Mental Health was part of the Mayoral Programme

and agreeing more needs to be done to support this area.

Emergency Motion

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir, Councillor Kiely requested to move

the following Emergency Motion and this was agreed:

“***I move at this meeting that Limerick City and County Council consider temporarily***

***opening the bus lane on O’Connell*** ***Street for the Christmas period, to relieve traffic***

***congestion and potentially encourage more footfall into the city.**”***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Butler, and

adopted.

In moving the Motion, Councillor Kiely referred to a presentation from a group of city

centre traders received at the November Metropolitan District Meeting. Following a

discussion on the reserved functions of Elected Members, the council was requested to

consider opening the O’Connell Street bus lane to all traffic for the Christmas period, to allow

more movement of traffic. In discussion some Members supported the Motion and

suggested the traffic congestion was discouraging people from coming to the city, while other

Members did not agree with the proposal, expressing concerns that the schedule of buses

running through the city would be severely disrupted. It was suggested that more buses were

also required to encourage more footfall into the City. Members queried if opening the bus

lane during off peak hours was an option, along with exploring the possibility of adding taxi

ranks to O’Connell Street at night-time to support the night-time economy in the City.

The Director of Transportation and Mobility advised the Members the bus lane on

O’Connell Street was essential for reliability in delivering a service to the people of

Limerick. He acknowledged the request of some Members to open the bus lane on O’Connell

Street, but advised that it was embedded in the Limerick Development Plan to move away

from the use of cars and move more towards public transport, highlighting this temporary

change would go against the policy of the Council

It was the view of some Members that opening the bus lane temporarily would not

interfere with the schedule of buses but would support the businesses in the city and it was

asked if it was possible for the Executive to approve the request. Other Members opposed

the request to open the lane indicating there were other ways of supporting traders.

The Members were informed that a consultation process was possibly required

before opening the bus lane and the short time frame to deliver on this was outlined. The

Mayor agreed to examine the issue with the Director of Transportation and Mobility,

including the need for a consultation process.---

MAYOR’S QUESTIONS

7.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

***I will ask the Mayor if the 100k over three years offered to the International Rugby***

***Experience can be offered to the LEDP to save the Markets Field given the fact that it has***

***been offered as a gift to Limerick City and County Council.***

**REPLY:**

I regret to say that what the Councillor proposes will no longer be possible

even though I have the highest of regard for what Ciara McCormack and Treaty

United contribute to Limerick.

The Councillor will be aware that my original gesture was made to cover the

shortfall of €100,000 for three years in the operating costs of the International

Rugby Experience. This was to supplement the already very generous offer of

the McManus Family to cover most of the very significant operating shortfall

for three years. With both offers covering the full operating shortfall, I had

hoped we might see the decision to close reversed and keep the attraction

open for the next three years and save the valuable jobs for the dedicated staff

and their families. It would also have helped small businesses in our city centre

by bringing visitors right to the junction of Cecil Street and O’Connell Street

and combat the high levels of vacancy which blight the nearby city streets.

The Councillor will also be aware that funds from my Mayoral Fund are only to

be used to progress items in the Mayoral Programme. A number of other

actions in the Programme are designed to similarly help bring footfall to the

city centre to help reverse those high levels of vacancy.

I believe Christmas offers us one such opportunity to show new leadership. As

someone who used to run a small retail business, I may be one of the best

positioned in this chamber to know that a key season for small retailers is the

Christmas season. That is why the mayoral programme contains the following

objective:

“ML121 – Enhance the offering of Limerick for Christmas by providing a

nationally significant Christmas market and other Christmas animation across

the city centre, encouraging occupants of Georgian buildings or other residents

and businesses of the city centre to make a special collective effort throughout

the city centre.”

To this end, the draft Budget booklet circulated this week allocates the IRE

funds of €100,000 from the Mayoral Fund along with an additional €25,000 to

begin to improve our Christmas offering. Many people have expressed their

disappointment to me with the plans for Christmas in Limerick this

year. Although I think we still have a very varied and rich programme, I share

their views that we can do better.---
20

But we all know that the best things need investment. The Christmas offering

this year had to be limited to match the funds of €150,000 allocated in the

budget this time last year – a budget which was approved by the prior council

of which of course the Councillor was a key member. A lighting up ceremony

would for example cost in the region of €100,000. So, with that limited budget

we would have had a lighting up ceremony and no lights. Planning for a great

Christmas also needs to begin early in the year so by the time the Mayoral

Programme was agreed it was already way too late to change direction

significantly.

I am sure that the Councillor loves Christmas as much as I do. With a new

Council we now have a chance to change direction and start afresh. We can

all agree that Limerick is not well served by restricting that spend to €150,000

while other cities like Waterford to which we look with envy spend up to

€500,000.

It is for this reason, I want us to use Christmas to create a more fun and

enjoyable Limerick and at the same time battle the crisis in retail in our city

centre and county towns. I am calling on Councillors to help me do that and

also increase their own allocation to Christmas by at least that amount.

That will almost treble the money we currently spend on Christmas activities

for next year and bring us more in line with other Irish cities.

Before anyone asks, this extra quarter of a million euro per annum is not just

for the city centre. I would like to see €50,000 of this additional funding spent

each year to improve Christmas in one or more of our county towns. Just like,

this year already, to deal with urgent repairs on the lights in NewcastleWest,

€50,000 or more was allocated to light up that town.

Before I finish, I want to come back to Treaty United. Since June, I have held a

number of meetings with Ciara (McCormack) and their investors, including a

multi-party call only two weeks ago. I am very impressed with and want to

support their work. It is regrettable that national government did not approve

any funding for their plans in the recent Large Sports Infrastructure Fund

decisions, despite the high priority Limerick through the executive including

myself gave their project.

I agree with the Councillor that it is now important for us all to support the

great work they are doing and support the transformation they are pushing

forward. I would therefore welcome any proposal from the Councillor and her

political group to identify another project they would offer to delay from 2025

so as to permit instead the reallocation of this €100,000 of capital funding to

the redevelopment of the Markets Field. If one is identified over the next few

days, I shall ask officials to immediately assess if that approach could instead

be agreed in time for our Budget meeting on Friday.---
21

**Suspension of Standing Order No. 4:** The Príomh Chomhairleoir drew attention to the time

which was approaching 5.30 p.m. and on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by

Councillor Teefy, Standing Order No. 4 was suspended in order to complete the agenda.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

***I will ask at the next Meeting wha**t are the Mayor’s plans now for the Designated Activity***

***Companies (DACs) following his recent legal advice.***

**REPLY:**

As a shareholder and Mayor of Limerick, I am uniquely positioned to influence

the future direction of the work of the DACs so that they best serve the

interests of the people of Limerick in helping to drive the outcomes of the

Development Plan and the Mayoral Programme and provide best value for

taxpayer monies. My dual roles allow me to balance the interests of our

community with the strategic goals of Limerick City and County Council and

the company. It is welcome to now finally put beyond doubt that the role of

“shareholder” in respect of shares owned by Limerick Council is indeed to be

exercised by the individual elected as Mayor with a democratic mandate to

deliver for Limerick.

**Strategic Vision**

My own vision for each of the DACs revolves around four core principles:

delivering for Limerick, innovation, community engagement, and pursuing

goals in line with the UN sustainable development goals. I now plan to develop

new shareholder representation letters, one for each DAC, setting out the role

they must play to align with Limerick’s core plans, the need for them to have

robust written strategic plans setting out what they will deliver and detailed

implementation/operating plans with clear deadlines for delivery of their

mission.

**Governance**

I propose next to carry out a short independent review of each of the DACs to

confirm that they are fully in line with best governance practice and the

applicable governance codes for state bodies. I have no reason to believe that

they are not but I think it is only appropriate to confirm that as we start out on

the next chapter for them. The review should also give clear guidance and

recommendations about the role for the shareholder, the board, the

management team of the DAC and the elected representatives, how to avoid

unnecessary conflicts of interest or perceptions of same, and ensure that the

oversight role of the elected representatives can be fulfilled.

The DAC boards have important responsibilities to carry out for each DAC and

we have to make sure that they are fully enabled and supported to do that. I

shall ask the reviewer to assess the range of skills on each board and the---
22

functioning of the boards up to now to guide me in the selection of new

directors to serve on the boards so as to ensure we have a diversity of

viewpoints and all the skills necessary. It is a principle of mine that board

directors should follow a system of rotation with five to six years being the

optimum maximum period of service (unless perhaps moving to the role of

Chair within that period). I shall shortly issue expressions of interest for

persons willing to serve as Directors in the DACs and in conjunction with the

Chair of the respective boards progress the necessary appointments to replace

retiring members or fill other vacancies.

I am aware that we now also have to fill the role of CEO at Limerick Twenty

Thirty DAC. I want again to thank David Conway for his service to Limerick. I

have already written to the Chair to ensure that the selection process takes

account of the approach set out here and had a meeting with the Chair of the

Remuneration Committee to that end. I anticipate having an exit interview

with David to learn what other improvements he believes we can make for the

future.

**Transparency and Accountability**

Everyone will know that I believe in maintaining transparency and

accountability in any public role. I believe the DACs in so doing can lead in

public disclosure in company documents and websites.

As a shareholder and Mayor, I will also ensure that open lines of

communication are established between the company, the local government,

and the community as represented by the elected representatives and myself.

I intend to ask the Director General and the Director of Finance to consider the

establishment for 2025 of a Shareholder Management Unit in Limerick City and

County Council (similar in role to that which I set up in the Department of

Finance or the role of New Era for other state bodies) to assist me in my duties

as shareholder and protect the interests of the taxpayers.

Regular meetings will be held between the responsible member of that Unit

and the management of each DAC to discuss progress, address concerns, and

gather feedback from all stakeholders. The Unit will also assist Councillors to

prepare for semi-annual (or more frequent if desirable) reviews by the Council

of the operation and delivery of each DAC.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, my plans as a shareholder and Mayor for each DAC will require

some transition. Great work has been done up to now but we are entering a

period of higher demands for delivery and therefore continuation of the

business as usual with which we have become accustomed may no longer be

the right choice. Furthermore, many of the plans for the DACs require---
23

considerable additional funding which has not yet been committed to by

national government, for example the new city library at Opera Square.

The DACs have a critical role in their work for Limerick and I believe that if we

do this next chapter well, we can achieve remarkable success for the company

while also fostering a prosperous and vibrant community.

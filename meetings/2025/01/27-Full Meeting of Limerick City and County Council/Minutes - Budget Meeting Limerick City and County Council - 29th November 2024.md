Circulated, (a) Draft Mayor’s Budget Report and Tables, including Capital Programme 2025-

2029; (b) Proposed Vacant Property Refund Scheme 2025; (c) Proposed Small and Medium

Business Support Scheme 2025;

The Mayor stated that the Members were required to consider the Mayor’s Draft Budget of

Limerick City and County Council for year ending 31st December, 2025, the Draft Budget

having been served in accordance with Section 103 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as

amended by the Local Government Reform Act, 2014, and the Local Government Rates and

Other Matters Act, 2019, as amended. He outlined the following:

**Budget 2025**

The draft Annual Budget for 2025 had been prepared in the context of using existing resources

to maintain the service provision at the same levels of 2024 despite the continued challenges

of rising costs while also enhancing resources in key priority areas identified during 2024.

New areas for focus identified for 2025 from the Mayoral Programme, where not capable of

being resourced from existing resources will be prioritised and resourced significantly from

the Mayoral Fund. All these key priority areas together will bring focus on local service

improvement with the aim to stimulate a More Liveable, a More Prosperous, and More

Healthy Limerick.

A key challenge is the ongoing inflationary pressures on all our services but particularly in the

areas of housing maintenance, street-cleaning, grass cutting and roads maintenance. While

this budget has increased resources across services, some elements will be eroded through

continued high construction related inflation and other input costs remaining high, e.g.,

energy costs.

Nonetheless certain key areas where additional resources for day to day operations are

needed are being recommended in the Revenue Budget. These reflect particular concerns

raised by elected representatives during the Mayoral Programme consultations. They

include:

 New Housing and Housing maintenance

 Housing Grants

 Homeless increased contribution---
3

 Local and Regional Roads own resources including public lighting

 Enhanced Small and. Medium Scheme to reflect commercial rate increase support

for SME’s

To fund increased demand, rising costs and the challenges of increasing pensions which are

not being covered by corresponding increases in central government funding without

imposing significant cuts in services year on year, the Budget seeks to maximise the available

income base in order to fund the above additional resources. It was recommended to

increase the Commercial Rate level by 4% the impact of which is incorporated into Draft

Budget 2025 as presented. It is understood this will impact on businesses at a time of

economic uncertainty. Accordingly, particular focus is taken to reduce this impact on small

and most vulnerable businesses. The impact of the rise will be mitigated (and sometimes fully

covered) through proposed enhancements in the SME support scheme. Additionally, in

identifying additional initiatives which could be funded from the increased revenues, targeted

proposals to increase the footfall in business areas of deal with areas of common concern to

employers and employees, like housing and security.

The budget also reflects increased income from increased commercial rates buoyancy,

differential rents, deposit interest and Local Property Tax.

The ongoing provision of new/upgraded amenity facilities (e.g. Askeaton Pool and Leisure/

Grove Island) and public lighting upgrades will have to be funded by loans raised and financed

through the revenue budget placing further pressures on our income base.

The Council is also pursuing an ambitious capital programme, focused on key priorities like

housing and infrastructure deficits while also maximising investment into the City and County

from a range of national programmes including URDF, RRDF, Outdoor Recreation Scheme,

Town and Village Renewal etc. All of these projects require co-funding from the Council.

Revenue funds from the Mayoral Fund are being prioritised to advance projects to alleviate

housing pressure, prepare projects for submissions to central Government Departments to

seek additional funding, to carry out assessments of existing facilities to help guide future

spending decisions, or in some cases to provide necessary co-funding thereby leveraging

resources – therefore utilising the Mayoral Fund most efficiently. Other smaller items

targeted will unlock projects long in gestation and identified in the mayoral programme or to

help small and local businesses.

**It was then unanimously agreed that the** **Mayor’s** **Report on the Draft Budget 2025, as**

**circulated to Members, would be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:**

**“Introduction**---
4

The Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December 2025 has been prepared,

circulated to Members and public notice of the Budget Meeting placed in the press, in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, the Local Government Rates & Other Matters Act 2019 as

amended and Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2024.

Circular Fin 11/2024 refers to the prescribed period that applies for the holding of the 2025

Budget meeting for Local Authorities as follows; 1st November 2024 to 6th December 2024. It

was agreed by the Members at the September Council meeting to hold the statutory Annual

Budget Meeting on Friday 29th November 2024 at 10am, at Council Chamber, Dooradoyle.

Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local Government Reform

Act 2014 and Local Government Rates & Other Matters Act 2019 as amended provides that

the Budget must be adopted within a period of 14 days beginning on the day on which the

local authority budget meeting meets. The Budget therefore must be adopted by 12th

December 2024.

**Budget Process**

The budget process for the preparation, consideration and adoption of the budget requires

statutory compliance with a number of steps, which can be summarised as follows:

***Step 1*** ***–*** ***Preparation and publishing of Mayoral Programme.*** The Mayoral Programme was

prepared and published as set out in Section 31 of the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick)

and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2024. The Mayoral Programme outlines the Mayor’s key

objectives and priorities for his term of office.

***Step 2 - Decision by the Council on the adjustment factor to the Local Property Tax (LPT)***

***following a public consultation process.*** This decision was made at the Council Meeting on

the 23rd September 2024 to leave the LPT adjustment factor at the 2024 levels for 2025.

***Step 3 - Allocation of the General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation (GMA).The Draft*

*Budgetary Plan was considered at the following meetings:*

Cappamore / Kilmallock Municipal District

17th October

Metropolitan District of Limerick

21st October

Newcastle West Municipal District

6th November

Adare / Rathkeale Municipal District

12th November

***Step 4 - Consultation with the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) and adoption of the Draft***

***Budget by Council.*** Initial CPG meeting held on 16th September. Budget Strategy presented

to CPG Meeting held on the 21st October with further meeting held on the 18th November.

The Statutory Budget meeting is scheduled for 29th November with budget workshops with

Councillors to be held on the 11th November and 22nd November.

***Step 5 - Consideration and adoption of the schedule of Municipal works by each of the***

***Metropolitan / Municipal Districts.*** These meetings will be convened in early 2025 following

the adoption of the Budget.---
5

***Step 6 - Consideration and adoption of the Service Delivery Plan.***The 2025 Service Delivery

Plan will be presented to Council at the January 2025 Council meeting.

Through consultation with the Corporate Policy Group and consideration of the views of

Council as expressed through the different stages of the budgetary process, in particular as

expressed through the meetings of the Municipal/ Metropolitan Districts, the budget as

presented considers this feedback in a reasoned and balanced manner.

At the Statutory Budget Meeting, Members are asked to make the following decisions:

 Adopt the Budget with or without amendment

 Determine the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV)

 Determine the vacancy abatement scheme on vacant commercial premises.

**Budget 2025 Context**

The draft Annual Budget for 2025 has been prepared in the context of using existing resources

to maintain the service provision at the same levels of 2024 despite the continued challenges

of rising costs while also enhancing resources in key priority areas identified during 2024.

income base in order to fund the above additional resources. I am recommending the difficult

decision to increase the Commercial Rate level by 4% the impact of which is incorporated into

Draft Budget 2025 as presented. It is understood this will impact on businesses at a time of

economic uncertainty. Accordingly, particular focus is taken to reduce this impact on small

help small and local businesses.

**National Economic Outlook**

Data provided in the Department of Finance Budget 2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook

supports the view that the Irish economy is in reasonably good shape at this point. There are,

however, two important caveats to this assessment. First, while the macro-position is fairly

healthy, there remains important sectoral imbalances – in the housing market, in other

strategic infrastructural areas (such as energy and water), in healthcare delivery – that are

weighing on economic and social progress. The second caveat relates to heightened levels of

uncertainty – in part the result of a more fractious geopolitical environment – that reinforce

the view that the future could be very different from the recent past.

Against this backdrop, a ***key macroeconomic objective of national Budget 2025*** is to ***support***

***the supply-side of the economy***, by increasing capital expenditure to address existing

infrastructural deficits, including the shortfall of housing output relative to population needs.

Government is allocating €14.9 billion next year by way of (voted) capital expenditure, the

highest level ever.---
7

In parallel with voted expenditure, the Government is allocating €3 billion from the proceeds

of recent share sales towards boosting public investment in housing (capitalisation of the Land

Development Agency), energy and water infrastructure.

***Inflation*** has retreated in the first half of this year, supporting the purchasing power of

household incomes. ***Employment*** has continued to expand, with the unemployment rate

hovering around 4½ per cent.

***Irish exports*** rebounded strongly in the first half of this year, following the post-pandemic

correction during 2023. While the headline figure was inflated in the second quarter (by the

one-off export of intellectual property assets), the underlying dynamic was solid, with strong

foreign sales of pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and, in particular, computer services. This

pattern is expected to continue in the second half of the year. Exports are projected to grow

by 8½ per cent this year.

On the ***building and construction*** side, investment within the commercial real estate sector

has been weak since the pandemic, with the structural shift in working arrangements

(increased work-from-home) reducing demand for office space. In addition, the rising cost of

capital has acted as an additional headwind over the past year or so. As a result, investment

within the sector is set to contract further this year. On the residential side, activity is

expected to accelerate in the second half of the year.

***Trading Enterprises in Ireland***: The concentration of economic activity in the Irish economy

has been well documented, as has the concentration of Ireland’s export portfolio within a

small number of sectors (ICT, pharma-chem). This sectoral-level concentration creates a clear

vulnerability for the domestic economy via employment, wages and corporate tax revenues.

Turning to the ***national*** ***budgetary situation***, a general government surplus of €23.7 billion is

projected for this year, the equivalent of 7.5 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI). This

figure includes the one-off transfer to the State arising from the Court of Justice of the

European Union ruling in September. ***Excluding the impact of this transfer, as well as the***

***Depar**tment’s estimate of windfall corporate tax receipts, there would be an underlying***

***fiscal deficit of around €6.3 billion (2 per cent of GNI) for this year.***

As the overall stance of macroeconomic policy adjusts – via a tightening of monetary policy

and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal support – ***global growth has slowed***. Ireland cannot be

immune from these trends, with trade a key transmission channel from the international to

the domestic economy. In other words, ***lower external demand is weighing on export***

***growth***. This impact is amplified by a number of sector-specific adjustments taking place in

some multinational-dominated sectors, such as reduced demand for Covid-related products

in the pharma sector. Sub-sectors such as semi-conductors have also posted lower foreign

sales, as have exports related to “contract manufacturing”. As a result, ***exports and GDP***

***growth are revised down for this year and next year***.

For ***domestic demand***, incoming data are sending mixed signals. On the one hand, the

domestic economy has proven to be remarkably solid, evidenced by an unemployment rate

that has stabilised at just over 4 per cent throughout this year. On the other hand, the level---
8

of Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) - a measure of the domestic economy - in the second

quarter this year was largely unchanged since the second quarter of last year, while higher-

frequency data (e.g. retail sales, consumer sentiment, payroll data) suggest a softening in

activity more recently. MDD is now expected to increase by 2.2 per cent this year, a small

downward revision of 0.1 percentage points compared to the spring forecasts. For next year,

MDD growth of 2.2 per cent is projected; a 0.4 per cent decrease in the projection (relative

to the spring 2023 forecasts) largely reflecting the headwinds associated with tighter

monetary policy working its way through the economy. ***Consumer spending***, the largest

component of MDD, is forecast to grow by 3.3 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent next year,

a downward revision in both years of just over ½ percentage point from the spring 2023

forecasts.

With ***underlying inflation proving to be more persistent*** than expected consumer price

inflation - as measured by the HICP index - is revised by just under ½ point to 5.3 per cent for

this year. For next year a rate of 2.9 per cent is forecast, as lower energy prices pass through

to consumer bills.

For this year ***employment growth*** of 3.4 per cent is projected, easing to slower rate of growth

of 1.3 per cent next year, consistent with the outlook for the domestic economy. An

unemployment rate of 4.1 per cent is projected for this year, increasing marginally to 4.2 per

cent next year. Almost all of the additional employment arose from increases in labour

supply. ***Net inward migration*** and ***increased participation*** – particularly female participation

– were the key drivers of this increase in labour supply.

Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are two-sided but tilted to the downside. A general

government surplus of €8.8 billion (3.0 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI)) is projected

for this year. For next year, the general government surplus is projected at €8.4 billion (2.7

per cent of GNI). Stripping out the Department’s estimate of ‘windfall’ corporate tax receipts,

a deficit of €2.0 billion would be recorded this year and €2.7 billion next year. Public

indebtedness next year is projected at €222 billion; pre-pandemic this figure was closer to

€203 billion.

To conclude, the experience of the last few years – the UK’s exit from the European Union, a

global pandemic and major war in Europe and now unrest in the Middle East – highlights the

major changes that are underway internationally and the impact geopolitics can have on

economic outcomes. Moreover, it is also clear that the geopolitical landscape is evolving,

with at least some decoupling of western economics from China now underway: several

multinational firms and some governments are de-risking their exposure to the Chinese

economy, inter alia by diversifying supply chains, in order to limit the impact of any shock

originating in that country, be it economic, geopolitical or other. A fragmentation of the

global economy along geopolitical lines is an important channel through which Irish living

standards could be held-back in the years ahead.

**Local Outlook:**

2024 marked a historic year for Limerick as John Moran was appointed Ireland's first directly

elected Mayor with executive responsibilities. The Mayor’s five-year Programme, *More for*

*Limerick*, sets out a transformative vision for the City and County through to 2029. The

Mayoral plan details ambitious goals across housing, infrastructure, and economic

development, all aimed at building a More Liveable, a More Prosperous, and More Healthy

Limerick.

In a backdrop of housing shortages and market rents rising sharply in Limerick (up 25 % year

on year according to most recent Daft.ie Rental price report) a key priority in the Mayoral

Programme is addressing the ongoing housing crisis. Recognising the need for innovative

housing solutions, I already have established a working group dedicated to advancing SMART

housing. This initiative includes delivering in a first phase at least 1,000 modular homes

locally, a move that will provide faster, more flexible housing options for Limerick’s growing

population and support sustainable urban development. It is critical that we find ways to

increase housing supply far above recent delivery levels and do that in the rental sector and

also in the longer term advance projects of scale for sustainable housing for purchase.

Despite acute ongoing shortfalls in investment in key areas for the Mid-West, the past year

has also seen significant progress in capital projects that are critical to Limerick’s economic

and social development. Limerick’s €80 million One Opera Square project has reached roof

level, and upon its completion in April 2025, will serve as a major employment hub,

accommodating over 1,000 jobs. This project will contribute to the revitalising of the city

centre with new business, retail, and leisure opportunities. In line with my commitment to---
10

see enhanced connectivity and infrastructure, phase two of the Limerick to Foynes Rail Line

is set to begin in 2025 and the Adare By-Pass is underway as is the floodproofing of homes

like those in King’s Island. This phase of the rail project will focus on installing a new signalling

system, level crossings, and track improvements at both Limerick and Foynes Port. With

completion anticipated by December 2025, the railway will be operational for freight in early

2026, also strengthening Limerick’s position as a key logistical hub and the business case for

passenger rail service as far as Adare.

Despite some uncertainties growing at the international level, Limerick’s appeal as an

attractive location for business and innovation continues to drive job growth and attract

major investments. Significant announcements from Eli Lilly, Mavarick, and Carelon Global

Solutions signal a strong commitment from established industry leaders, while new

investments from companies such as Whoop and North American Bancard highlight

Limerick’s growing reputation on the global stage. These investments demonstrate the

confidence investors have in Limerick’s skilled workforce, strategic location, and pro-business

status. As a result, Limerick is not only generating thousands of new jobs, but continues to

be recognised globally as a destination for high-value industries, further strengthening the

region’s economy and future prospects. This highlights the need for focus on retaining and

attracting talent to our region and opening up these opportunities to residents of all

communities in Limerick as well as getting ahead of new annual demand for housing so as to

see prices fall for everyone.

Looking ahead, Limerick’s economic potential continues to grow as we position ourselves to

capitalise on the renewable energy sector. Limerick is actively pursuing opportunities in the

offshore wind industry, which has the potential to create thousands of jobs and establish

Limerick as a leader in green energy production. Substantial investments in housing,

infrastructure, and renewable energy reflect a broader commitment to a sustainable future,

aligned with the strategic objectives of the *More for Limerick* programme.

**Implementation of the Mayoral Programme**

The implementation of the “**More for Limerick”** Mayoral Programme is designed to deliver

transformative changes across Limerick over the next five years through a rigorous, multi-

faceted approach. The programme sets ambitious actions designed to meet Limerick's

evolving needs. Recognising that a significant increase in national funding will be required, I

have committed to advocating for more resources for Limerick and building stronger

partnerships between Limerick and government departments to ensure the programme’s

success. The programme also introduces innovative governance structures, creating a new

delivery framework across local government and in partnership with private sector and

community stakeholders’ involvement.

Key to this approach will be the alignment of the Mayoral Programme with Limerick City and

County Council’s Corporate Plan 2024-2029, which serves as the operational document for

achieving the programme's objectives. The creation of the Mayoral Programme Delivery

Office within the Council will ensure ongoing coordination and tracking of all initiatives, with

quarterly updates provided to maintain transparency and accountability. This office will work

closely with the Mayoral Advisory and Implementation Committee, a newly established body---
11

that brings together representatives from public and private sectors, ensuring actions remain

relevant and adaptable to changing circumstances.

High Level Expert Groups, Task Forces, and the Limerick Mayoral and Government

Consultative Forum have all been introduced to provide expertise and support across a broad

range of areas including housing, transport, and economic development. These groups will

guide policy formation and alignment to the Mayoral Programme with broader national

frameworks, including the National Planning Framework and Project Ireland 2040.

**Budget Strategy & Objectives**

The Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the

overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory,

contractual, legal and other obligations. It incorporates the decisions made by the Council in

relation to the Local Property Tax and General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocations. Under

the Local Government Act, 2001 as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, Local

Government Rates & Other Matters Act 2019 as amended and Local Government (Mayor of

Limerick) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2024, the Draft Budget is required to set out the

expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the Council and the income estimated to

accrue to the Council.---

**Outturn 2024**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2025 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

The Annual Financial Statement of Limerick City and County Council for the year 2023 shows

the accumulated balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit position of €956,037. I have

reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to break-

even on the Revenue Account for 2024 despite challenges faced by the Council; however

there is pressure on a number of income heads and ongoing controls on expenditure are in

place. In particular, I am concerned with the significant increase in energy costs and other

inflationary pressures, which are affecting not only our own services but also those of our

subsidiary companies. The 2025 draft Budget reflects the need to continue a strong financial

management ethos while making every effort to meet the ever-increasing demands on the

services of Limerick City and County Council.

**Analysis of Expenditure Requirements 2025**

The total estimated expenditure included in the Draft Budget for 2025 amounts to €926.6

million, a decrease of €16.19 million on the adopted figure for 2024. The decreased activity

in the HAP Shared Service Center- accounts for the majority of this decrease. As this

expenditure is matched by a corresponding income, it has no net effect on the Budgetary

Provisions. The following Table 2 depicts Revenue expenditure by Division.

**Grants and Subsidies Income**

Grants and Subsidies income excluding HAP income for Draft Budget 2025 is €118.3m and is

noted in Table E. Some of the key income sources under this heading include:

 Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of

social housing by providing financial support to local authorities and Approved

Housing Bodies for the leasing of houses and apartments. Such long-term leasing is

noted at €13m for 2025 which is similar to 2024 provision.

 Road Grants are assumed to remain at 2024 levels.

 Compensation for increases in rates of pay and PSPR resulting from the unwinding of

FEMPI legislation and increases in pay and pensions relating to the Public Sector

Stability Agreement and assumed pay increases for 2025 (pending national pay-talks)

is noted at €18.96m in Draft Budget 2025 (increase of €4.68m compared to 2024 due

to pay increases in 2024 & 2025). ***The Department have not confirmed the actual***

***compensation amount for Retained Firefighters increased pay for 2025***, and it is

assumed for the purposes of Draft Budget 2025 such pay increases are fully funded by

the Department.

**Local Property Tax (LPT) Allocation and LPT Baseline Review 2025**

Local Property Tax (LPT) is a key funding source for Local Government replacing the General

Purpose Grant funding allocation.

Under the current LPT allocation model, every local authority is entitled to receive a minimum

amount of funding under the LPT allocation process, known as Baseline. Following a review

of LPT Baselines in 2023, local authority baselines were increased from overall €353m to

€428.4m for 2024 and will remain at this level again in 2025. Accordingly, Limerick City &

County Council’s Baseline for 2025 is €19,054,464.

LPT baseline allocations for 2025 are set in line with the methodology whereby 100% of the

estimated LPT yield is retained locally within the local authority area where it is collected, and

for Limerick to reach the baseline it’s a net recipient from the equalisation fund by the amount

of €3,378,010.

**Equalisation**

In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government – “Our Shared Future”; 100%

of the estimated LPT yield is retained locally within the local authority area where it is

collected. All equalisation funding will be met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities

receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline. The equalisation funding

requirement will be based on the total expected level of LPT in each local authority area and

will not be adjusted if the basic rate of LPT is varied.

Based on its shortfall position when expected 2025 LPT receipts are compared to the 2025

Baseline, Limerick City & County Council will be in receipt of equalisation funding in 2025.---
20

The Local Property Tax (Local Adjustment Factor) Regulations 2022 do not refer to yearly

decisions but instead to “a period as specified in the resolution”, meaning elected members

can now set a local adjustment factor for a period of their choosing. The Local Government

Reform Act 2014 and associated Regulations permits the Members of the Council to vary the

Rate by a maximum increase or decrease of 15%. In September 2024, the Council decided to

adjust the LPT rate upwards by 15% for 2025 equating to an increase of €2,351,468. It should

also be noted that after the 2021 property revaluation for LPT assessment over 50% of

properties in Limerick now fall into the 1st valuation category with a base value for Local

Property Tax of €90.

The 2025 allocation from the Local Property Tax and the calculation provided by the DHPLG

on the basis of this allocation is set out in ***Table 4*** below:

**Table 4: LPT Reconciliation 2025**

**Commercial Rates**

Commercial Rates is a significant contributor to the total budgeted income for the Council

and it is vital to the level of service delivery that income from this source is maximised. In this

respect it is critically important that the Valuation Office reverts promptly with new valuations

during 2025. Limerick City and County Council will continue to ensure that all commercial

properties in the City and County are included on the rates records and are properly rated.

Draft Budget 2025 is presented with a commercial rate increase of 4% for 2025 in order to

fund demands from rising costs in key areas and initiatives to help businesses.

**Vacant Property Abatement Scheme 2025**

The commencement of section 9 of the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019,

as amended, will allow local authorities to adopt schemes for the abatement of rates in

respect of vacant property for 2025. These schemes are to replace the refund of rates on

vacant property adopted annually. The Local Government Act 1946 are now repealed and

replaced by section 9. Vacancy abatement schemes under section 9 are a reserved function

to be approved at the local authority budget meeting. It is proposed to amend the scheme

so as to reward businesses moving into vacant premises more than those owning properties

which remain vacant. This will be a first step in such a process which will be enhanced over---
21

my mayoral term. Therefore I am proposing that there would be no abatement of rates due

to Limerick City and County Council by a liable person for vacant properties for the financial

year ending 31 December 2025. The vacancy abatement percentage would therefore be

reduced from 10% to 0%.

Separately the Council will be asked to consider the adoption of the Vacant Property Refund

Scheme 2025 to encourage the beneficial use of previously vacant commercial property in

accordance with Section 66 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended by Section 43 of

the Local Government Reform Act, 2014 as outlined in Table 5 below:

**Band**

**% Refund**

Up to €12,000 Annual Rate Demand (with payment of

Over €60,001 Annual Rate Demand (with payment of

100% required)

0%

**Table 5: Vacant Property Scheme 2025**

**Small and Medium Business Support Scheme 2025 (SME Scheme)**

The proposed Small and Medium Business Support scheme will pay a financial support to

occupiers of commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €31,200 (2024: €30,000) but not less than €1 in 2025. The proposed % support for

2025 rates is 17.5% (2024: 13.5%) subject to a maximum refund of €2,000 (2024: €1,500)

which will be subject to a number of terms and conditions.

I am also proposing that occupiers of formerly vacant commercial premises would get a 50%

refund of commercial rates in the first year of occupation subject to a maximum refund

amount of €10,000.

**Increased Cost of Business Scheme (ICOB)**

In 2024 the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced a package which

recognised the ongoing challenges businesses are facing which included the approval for the

Increased Cost of Business Scheme (ICOB), which is a once-off grant to benefit up to small and

medium businesses (SMEs). 2,894 customers availed of the ICOB grant in Limerick during

2024, with Euro 11.3m paid in grants to qualifying SMEs.

**Power-Up Grant**

The Power Up grant was announced by government in Budget 2025 which is being

administered by the local authorities and fully funded by central Government. It has a budget

of €170 million and is aimed at SMEs in the hospitality, retail and beauty sectors. This scheme

builds on the success of the Increased Cost of Business Scheme (ICOB) which has paid €244---
22

million to 75,000 businesses right across the country. The grant is available to qualifying

businesses as a contribution towards the rising costs faced by businesses.

The scheme opened for registrations on 24 October 2024 and to date 75% of eligible

businesses have registered for the grant. Qualifying ratepayers are being reminded of this

grant and to apply for same.

The deadline for registration has been extended to Friday 22 November 2024.

A business in the hospitality, retail and beauty sector must have received the second ICOB

payment and continue to meet the ICOB criteria in order to be eligible for €4,000 Power Up

grant.

**Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Transactional Shared Service Centre**

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is the principal platform for underpinning the

provision of housing support in Ireland and has been in operation for a number of years. HAP

is one of the largest non-capital financial support packages for housing in Ireland and is

provided by all Local Authorities under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. The

availability of HAP enables all Local Authorities to provide housing support to over 54,200

households with a long-term housing need, including many long-term Rent Supplement

recipients.

The HAPSSC will administer circa 8,800 new tenancies in 2025 and process in excess of €635

million in payments to HAP landlords and collect €157 million in differential rent from HAP

tenants.

**City Centre Response Team (CCRT)**

The CCRT (City Centre Response Team) is a newly established dedicated team specifically for

the city centre, providing additional support to the existing maintenance teams. Consisting of

four General Operatives and an Executive Engineer for the purpose of maintaining and

repairing minor maintenance jobs to improve the public realm of Limerick City Centre. The

team's primary responsibility is to provide fast additional support for the following services:-

1. Addressing litter black spots.

2. Footpath maintenance.

3. Painting of bollards, fences, kerbs, planters etc.

4. Cleaning of footpaths and pedestrianised areas.

5. Monitoring/repair/replacement of litter bins.

6. Repair and replace traffic bollards.

7. Minor capital projects in the public realm such as footpath replacement, resurfacing

and improvement of laneways.

8. Working closely with businesses/stakeholders/public representatives in the city

centre to address issues of concern.

**Climate Action**---
23

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that each

Local Authority must develop a Climate Action Plan. The preparation of the Plan commenced

in early 2023 and was completed and published this year. The plan includes details for a

proposed decarbonisation zone which includes much of the Newtown Perry are including the

Colbert Quarter. The Decarbonisation Zone will be a test bed that will not only demonstrate

what can be done and accelerate learning for other areas but also to help understand the

scale of the challenge in decarbonising the economy and wider society. It is hoped that the

climate action plan will harness and facilitate investment and funding into the council from a

range of sources including the Climate Action Fund.

**General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation (GMA) 2025**

Circular Fin 08/2015 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)

(Amendment) Regulations (S.I.363 of 2015), which amends the Local Government (Financial

and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 by providing that the meeting at which Municipal/

Metropolitan members consider the draft budgetary plan must conclude no later than 10

days prior to the local authority budget meeting.

The draft budget has included a general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocation of €1.652m in

total for district members, which will provide a focus and clarity as regards how the elected

members want to account for the expending of monies within their area. There is an objective

of moving towards equal funding per councillor (parity) over the coming years in how GMA is

allocated across the four municipal/ metropolitan areas, with overall GMA funding linked to

Local Property tax increases, any Commercial Rates increase, and contribution from revenue

budget process.

**Schedule of Municipal/ Metropolitan works:**

Following the adoption of the budget a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and

repairs to be carried out during 2025 in each Municipal/ Metropolitan District will be prepared

for consideration and adoption by the Municipal/ Metropolitan District Members.

**Water Services/ Uisce Éireann (formerly Irish Water).**

The Water Services budget now covers the payroll costs for 96 full time staff equivalents and

central management charges that will be recouped from Uisce Éireann**.** Materials,

equipment, services, plant hire and energy are now purchased through the Uisce Éireann

procurement system and, therefore, no longer appears on the Council’s expenditure system.---
24

**Capital Budget 2025-2029**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, a 3-year capital programme must be prepared and considered

by the member of the Council. Please find attached a report on the programme of capital

projects proposed for the 5 years 2025 to 2029 to correlate with the Mayor of Limerick period

of tenure. Given the fact that the capital programme as proposed is over a 5-year time-frame,

it would be unrealistic to suggest that these allocations are definitive and are subject to

funding being available in future years. Capital projects by their very nature are flexible rolling

plans which involve an annual review and possible adjustment and alignment to the Mayoral

Programme. An important evolution over my term will be the increase in allocations to

housing supply. Below please find a summary of potential recommended spend and source

of funding for the 5 year capital plan 2025-2029 as of this year.

**Conclusion**

The overall objective of the budget preparation for 2025 has been again to maintain existing

services to a high standard, implement Mayoral programme enhancements while also

enhancing resources in key priority areas identified during 2025, and ensure that Limerick City

and County Council fulfils its statutory and regulatory obligations in an environment of

increased costs and limited funding. The demand for services across Limerick continues to

grow and this is matched by an increase in public expectation.

In balancing the budget, I have tried so far as possible with limited resources to accommodate

members’ feedback particularly in relation to increased maintenance demands on our social

housing stock, the level of match funding for housing grants, continued investment in our

road infrastructure, and demands on our horticulture section with new and existing amenities

to be maintained.

During 2024, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events such as the continuing

humanitarian response for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, increased inflationary pressures

arising from the invasion of Ukraine and related high energy costs, which demonstrated the

professionalism, commitment and determination of staff to manage the impact of these

events.

The Mayoral Programme under Section 31 of the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) and

Miscellaneous Provision Act 2024 has now been finalised, and in 2025 work will continue to

ensure delivery of the key objectives and priorities as set out in this programme such as

Housing Delivery, and with the aim to stimulate a More Liveable, a More Prosperous, and

More Healthy Limerick.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Príomh Chomhairleoir and the Elected

Members, for their assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy

Group in preparing this budget.

I also wish to express my appreciation to the Council’s Management Board and their own

teams for their commitment and hard work in preparing this document. The coming year will

again be challenging, but it will offer significant opportunities.

I look forward to the full support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to be held

Friday 29th November 2024.

all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the corresponding Capital programmes.

Following the Financial Accountants overview of the Budget, the Príomh Chomhairleoir

division.---

**Councillor Sheahan**

Councillor Sheahan, speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Group, stated that this is a historic

day for Limerick and thanked the Mayor, the Director General and the Executive for the work

that had gone in to the preparation of the Budget. He acknowledged the challenges involved

in balancing a budget and complimented the Finance team on their work and input into the

Budget.

He raised concerns with the proposed commercial rate increase of 4%, which would greatly

effect a percentage of larger business. While he noted this would be offset for many

businesses with an increase in the Small and Medium Business Enterprise Scheme from 13.5%

to 17.5%, he queried if an alternative way of balancing the budget could be considered,

instead of an increase to commercial rates. He welcomed the proposed increases in housing

maintenance and housing grants, along with funding for road maintenance and public

lighting. While he embraced the increase to these key areas, he expressed concern over the

condition of Local Authority houses, and also enquired if the proposed road maintenance

increase was sufficient.

Councillor Sheahan referred to the Mayoral Programme as being quite ambitious and queried

oversight on the funding for the programme to show where value is added for the people of

Limerick. He pointed out that the Elected Members had voted in favour of the 15% increase

above base rate in Local Property Tax for 2025, to continue to enable the Council to deliver

services. He asked each Director of Service if they were satisfied with the budget for their

divisions, and if it will allow them facilitate the delivery of ongoing local services.

**Councillor Collins (M)**

Councillor Collins (M), speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Group, acknowledged it was a

historic day for Limerick with this being the first budget of the directly elected Mayor of

Limerick. He referred to the work that goes into the preparation of a Budget and thanked the

Mayor, the Director General, the Executive and in particular he thanked Irene Griffin and Pat

Murnane.

He noted the fact that there was a proposed 4% increase in commercial rates and stressed

concerns for businesses that cannot avail of Small and Medium Business Enterprise Scheme,

with the recent introduction of automatic enrolment scheme and increased minimum wage,

he outlined that this sector is already under pressure.

Councillor Collins (M) referred to the key objectives of the Council and welcomed the increase

to Housing Maintenance, Housing Grants, Roads Maintenance and the introduction of the

grant for hedge cutting, which will assist landowners maintain their own hedge grow. While

he was pleased to see a focus on these areas, he expressed disappointment at the condition

of our housing stock in the County, and hoped to see an improvement in the refurbishment

of houses in 2025.---

**Councillor Benson**

Councillor Benson, speaking on behalf of the Sinn Féin Party, welcomed the extra provisions

for housing maintenance, and praised the Director of Housing for her honest review of costs

to deliver housing services in Limerick. She expressed concern in relation to the outsourcing

of housing maintenance work to contractors, and queried if it was good value for money.

She commended the proposed increase to homeless services, which will be very helpful for

people in need of these services throughout Limerick city and county.

At this point in the Meeting, it was agreed to take a 30-minute break and the Meeting

was adjourned until 14.45.

**Councillor Teefy**

On behalf of the non-party Members, Councillor Teefy acknowledged the work of the Finance

team in the preparation of the budget and thanked all involved in presenting a balanced

budget. Councillor Teefy referred to the provision of increased funding for Housing

Maintenance and Housing Adaption Grants and welcomed these, noting they will greatly

assist the people of Limerick. She commended the proposed increased resources in the

budget for festivals and events and reminded the Executive to use these equally across both

the city and county. While she noted and welcomed the increase in road maintenance, she

stressed it will not cover the cost of the roads infrastructure in her Municipal District.

Members asked questions on several aspects of each Division which were responded to by

the Director General and the relevant Director of Service.

All divisions were considered by the Members and the following points were raised;

 Members referred to the bin waiver scheme and queried if the eligibility to the scheme

could be expanded to include other categories;

 Members expressed concern over the 2km section of the Foynes to Attflyn road that

is not included in the scheme and requested this to be looked at;

 Members queried the budget for school meals and asked for clarity on the budget of

130,000 for 2025;

 Members supported increase in provisions for Housing Maintenance but expressed

concerns in relation to the condition of a lot of our housing stock;

 Members welcomed the increase to Homeless Services and Housing Adaption Grants;

 Members referred to the cost of running the Fire Service, in particular the training

costs;

 Looked for more support for maintenance of burial grounds and particularly burial

grounds where the access road is not owned by the Council;---
28

 Members questioned why the Council is responsible for Coroner fees;

 Members referred to the HAP Shared Services Centre and if these accounts could be

presented independent of the Revenue budget;

In responding to the Members’ queries, the Director of Services agreed it was a challenging

budget with inflation playing a key factor, however, they welcomed the provision for

additional resources in key areas. They outlined that these provisions will allow them to

continue to work to deliver quality services in their areas in 2025, and agreed to work closely

with the Members in doing so.

The Director of Service for Housing and the Director of Service for Transportation and

Mobility, confirmed that both housing and roads were more demand led services with very

little discretion. While they noted these are areas where the budget is always overspent, they

did welcome the proposed increases for 2025, which will enable the Council to continue to

deliver quality services in these key areas across the city and county.

The Directors also welcomed the increase to the budget for Festival and Events, Public

Lighting, Parks and Open Spaces and the provision of costs to assist the Council in meeting

climate action targets. The Director for Rural, Culture, Community and Tourism informed the

Members that the School Meals Programme was an initiative by the Department of Education

and outlined that 50% of the funding comes from the Department, with the remaining 50%

coming from the Council’s budget.

In response to the Members concerns in relation to insufficient funding for burial grounds,

the Director of Service, Environment, Climate Action and Shared Services, pointed out the

proposed 10% increase in the budget for burial ground maintenance, but he agreed to review

this service with the Members in each Municipal District.

It was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Collins (M), to

take an adjournment to consider the proposed budget presented to the Members by the

Mayor.

Upon resumption, it was proposed by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Collins

(M) to extend the adjournment for another 45 minutes, and agreed.

When the meeting recommenced, Councillor Sheahan thanked the Mayor, the Director

General and the Executive for their engagement in the process and noted they had a final

proposal for the Members to consider.

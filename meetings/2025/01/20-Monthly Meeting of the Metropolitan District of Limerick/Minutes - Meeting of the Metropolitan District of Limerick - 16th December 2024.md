‘The Council have identified a number of sites for a new burial ground to serve the

Castletroy area and have completed a desktop exercise in relation to same. Each of the sites

require site investigation to determine ground conditions and general suitability of the site

for a burial ground. This process is underway and a preferred site will be identified in due

course.’

Since the date of our previous response, the Council have carried out further analytical

assessments and discounted a number of the initial sites identified for various reasons i.e.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick Council advise***

***why people in receipt of the bin waiver have to pay a subsidy to their bin provider if they go over***

***a certain weight.*** ***The weight allowance is very low if elderly people living alone have to pay fees***

***towards the second half of the year.***

**REPLY**: The weight allowance for Household Waste Subsidy Scheme is 120kg per bin, i.e. 120kg

General Waste, 120kg Mixed Dry Recyclables, 120kg Food Waste Recycling, a total of 360kg.

During 2022, Limerick City and County Council tendered for the establishment of four (4)

**11.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if road calming measures***

***can be installed at the junction of Willow Avenue and Woodbine Avenue, Caherdavin Heights, as***

***this junction has been flagged as dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists by local residents.***

**REPLY:** Active Travel will review road calming measures at the junction of Willow Avenue and

Woodbine Avenue, Caherdavin Heights with Limerick City and County Council Travel &

Transport Operations & Maintenance as part of NTA allocation for 2025.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council has plans to***

***improve footpaths on Caragh Avenue, Caragh Drive and Sheelin Road, Caherdavin, as part of***

***their ongoing footpath improvement works in the Caherdavin area.***
---

**REPLY:** Footpath improvements in the Caherdavin area will be prioritised based on need, resource

allocations and funding from the Department of Transport, the NTA and other sources of

funding such as General Municipal Allocation. The locations described at Caragh Avenue,

Caragh Drive and Sheelin Road, Caherdavin may be considered if deemed a priority over

other footpaths in need of refurbishment throughout the Metropolitan North area.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***Mayor’s Fund initiative that traditionally provides hampers from the Milk Market to Limerick***

***families in need.***

**REPLY**: The Mayor’s Christmas Coal tradition, once a gesture of goodwill, involved distributing a

bag of coal to the needy in Limerick City. This was an unadvertised gesture, offering

assistance to the very needy of Limerick city.

Over time, due to environmental concerns, the tradition was adapted, and the coal was

replaced by a food hamper, but the scheme remained unadvertised, restricted to Limerick

City, and without any clear process for the Mayor to identify the most needy citizens, or for

them to apply.

I understand that funds to purchase the coal, and more recently hampers sourced at the

Milk Market, came mostly from donations by the business community in Limerick City given

to the Mayor to operate the scheme.

Currently, funds allocated by the exchequer to the Directly Elected Mayor are subject to

strict public sector spending rules. These rules prohibit implementing such a scheme

without a fair and transparent process, as this would risk creating a perception of

patronage, given that the Mayor is directly elected and the beneficiaries, who are also

voters, might appear to receive benefits solely through the Mayor's arbitrary discretion.

Furthermore, it would be deemed inappropriate for a directly elected Mayor to solicit

donations from the business community to fund the distribution of hampers to a group of

people selected based on unadvertised criteria, while excluding those residing in the

County.

I nonetheless recognise the value of the tradition, and would be happy in my role as Mayor

to lend non-financial support to an initiative to continue the tradition in some more

appropriate form – perhaps led by the Príomh Chomhairleoir or the Chair of the

Metropolitan District or any group of Councillors. If so, I would suggest that the Councillors

wishing to maintain the tradition come up with rigorous and fair criteria for choosing the

recipients and funding the scheme.

In any case, I would advise anyone in need of support during the festive period to contact

Citizens Information or other charities supported by Council funds for sources of assistance.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**14.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**
---
8

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we engage with the***

***relevant Council Department and request that King John's Castle be lit up from the river side to***

***enhance the vista.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kiely highlighted the benefits of additional lighting at the

Castle, which would provide illumination and greatly enhance the area at nighttime.

**REPLY**: Specialist electrical design consultancy services have been procured and appointed by

Discover Limerick DAC for the preparation of designs for the feature illumination of King

John’s Castle including its river facing elevation. Design proposals are currently being

assessed for appropriateness. Funding will be required to support the installation of any

approved illumination scheme.

**15.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that Limerick City and***

***County Council would write to An Garda Siochana to ask that every effort is made to**ensure that***

***Chestnut Close in Elm Park and indeed all estates in the area are free from illegally parked***

***vehicles thus allowing service vehicles including bin trucks proper access to these estates.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor Secas and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Pond highlighted the ongoing issues in the area, with

emergency services, service vehicles and residents experiencing difficulties accessing the estates.

Members welcomed the Motion and agreed that immediate action is required to rectify this for

the residents living in these areas.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that in light of the***

***correspondence received from the Director General between Active Travel and the Fire Service***

***and Building Control that a full review be carried out on all constructed and proposed Active***

***Travel Schemes of the negative impact such schemes may have on emergency response times***

***and a full report be furnished to the elected members of the Metropolitan District.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor McSweeney, seconded by Councillor Butler and

agreed.

In moving the Motion, Councillor McSweeney outlined the need to take measures to ensure

emergency services are not negatively impacted by Active Travel Schemes in Limerick. He

requested that all constructed and planned Active Travel Schemes are reviewed, any issues

identified are rectified and that the report on the review is shared with the Elected Members.

**REPLY**: The Active Travel Department carried out a tender process in 2022 to review projects and

alignment with Emergency Responder.

Our Team has re-run this tender and awaits submission in January 2025, once this report is
---

completed and reviewed it will be shared with Elected Members.

Following on from discussions, it was agreed that a report on a scheme by scheme basis of Active

Travel measures would be prepared for the January, or at the latest February meeting. This would

be based on the submissions from the Fire Service, setting out how the schemes were modified or

adjusted to address the concerns raised in the submissions received. This report would be

circulated to all Members and a Briefing would be organised for the Members of the Metropolitan

District.

**17.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council installs***

***more public bins along the route of Cratloe Road, Sexton Street North and High Road, stretching***

***from Thomond Park to the River Shannon.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara, seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hickey-O’Mara highlighted the need for additional bins on this

important route, which had a lot of littering.

**REPLY**: There are currently ten Council serviced bins along the route from Moylish Roundabout to

the Bishop’s Palace on the eastern side of the River Shannon, including two adjacent to the

Treaty Stone. In addition, there two privately serviced bins at two shops along this route

and TUS service another bin at their entrance. Some bins are prone to being filled with

domestic waste or may have domestic waste left beside them, these are being monitored

and litter bins may be removed if they are resulting in increased litter in a particular location.

Between Thomond Park and the pedestrian crossing adjacent to the Treaty Veterinary Clinic

there is a significant distance between Council litter bins. To address this the Cleansing

Section will install an additional bin at the De Valera Park Bus Stop which is adjacent to the

new TFI cycle station.

Members supported the Motion and queried if the bin outside the Spar Shop on Henry Street,

which had been removed, could be replaced.

In response, Senior Executive Engineers, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing, outlined that the bin on

Henry Street was removed due to the volume of domestic waste left around the bin. He agreed to

review the area again and re-instate the bin if required.

**18.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Planning***

***Enforcement ensure that every enforcement complaint is acknowledged and responded to within***

***14 days in the Metropolitan area.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Hickey-

O’Mara and agreed.
---
10

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan stated that responses to complaints needed to be

issued as quickly as possible, particularly for those living close to construction sites.

**REPLY**: All complaints received by the Planning Enforcement Team are acknowledged as soon as

possible, and generally within a number of days after receipt.

Thereafter, the complaint is received and investigated, and in accordance with the

provisions of Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) the Planning Authority

seeks to determine appropriate action within a 6 week period.

The Planning Enforcement Team is a small team and deals with a large number, and wide

variety of complex cases. It would not be possible to acknowledge, investigate and respond

to complaints within a 14 day period.

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

This concluded the Meeting.

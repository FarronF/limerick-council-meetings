In the presentation, the Mayor gave the following overview of the Limerick DACs:

**Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC** – delivering large-scale commercial development in Limerick City

Centre such as Opera Centre, Cleeves, Gardens International; residential in Mungret and

modular housing in Mullingar. Limerick Twenty Thirty is currently awaiting funding for Office

of Public Works and Library/Offices in Opera Centre.

**Innovate Limerick DAC** – owner of Engine building on Cecil Street and enterprise facilities in

the county. It is involved in start-up incubation and Film in Limerick and is co-owned by

Enterprise Ireland.

**Discover Limerick DAC** – founded to own and run King John’s Castle. Since then it became

the owner of Lough Gur and the Adare Heritage Centre.

The Mayor briefed the Members on the Governance Framework of DACs, outlining that they

were legal companies, and accordingly, roles of Boards, Shareholders and Chief Executive

Officers followed Irish Company Law. They were funded largely through public funding so

were not mere private companies. He advised that Sole Shareholder DACs had slightly

different rules recognising that no protection of minority shareholders was required. The

Mayor referred to the ‘Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies’ and related

guidance that had been issued by National Government.

The Mayor outlined the potential of the three Limerick DACs as follows:

**Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC**

 Could become a major player in land management and housing delivery in Limerick

towns, villages or city sites not within the remit of the Land Development Agency;

 Possible vehicle for the funding of SMART homes directed at private sector rental;

 Limerick City and County Council owner of rental homes (Vienna Model) starting in

Abbeyfeale;

 Needed to be funded to drive faster and more valued outcomes in Cleeves and Opera,

especially Office of Public Works building;

 Possible co-ordinator of all commercial office space of scale, owned by Limerick City

and County Council.

**Innovate Limerick DAC**

 Work on a new strategy is required once minority shareholding of Enterprise Ireland

was resolved;

 Could become a major player in supporting the growth of Small and Medium

Enterprises (SMEs) in Limerick and providing work spaces for same;

 Development plan and funding needed for renovation of other units at the Cecil Street

lands;

 Possibility to divest of ownership and development of buildings to Limerick Twenty

Thirty DAC and concentrate on operating within.

**Discover Limerick DAC**

 Masterplan for King John’s Castle to be advanced and development to continue

thereafter;

 Decisions required around Adare Heritage Centre and related funding needs;

 Possibility to become a player in the ownership and holistic development of Lough Gur

and other heritage sites in East Limerick;

 Possibility to be the vehicle to drive on the Game Cube;

 Discover Limerick DAC is in serious need of funding.

The Mayor highlighted the key milestones reached to date and referred to the governance

review of the Limerick DACs that was currently ongoing as a positive approach to moving

forward, and he informed the Meeting that LBS Partners were appointed to carry out this

review. He pointed out the objectives and scope of the review and noted that the goal was

to improve decision-making, transparency, risks, performance and accountability. He

informed the Members that an interim Chair had been appointed to Limerick Twenty Thirty

DAC.

The Mayor advised the Members what the next steps were and these included:

 Finalise the Governance Review Initial Draft and bring to Corporate Policy Group;

 Issue Expression of Interests for Directors;

 Finalise CEO selection for Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC;

 The Members inquired about the selection process for the new board members and

meetings should be shared to the Elected Members.

He pointed out that the guidelines at a national level needed to be followed in relation to his

role as Sole Shareholder, and would clarify if it was possible for him to circulate the legal

advice he had received.

He acknowledged that the AGMs had not taken place but noted it was not unusual for

companies to hold their Annual General Meetings three months after the end of year. He

confirmed that meetings of boards had taken place stating that some Members are sitting on

those boards.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir, as a point of clarity, informed those present that the Members

had resigned from the DACs as of the day before this Special Meeting.

The Mayor highlighted the need for a governance review and outlined that this report would

be brought to Corporate Policy Group for further discussion once completed.

The Director General informed the Members that the DACs were established as local

development companies to look at local problems. He noted that the Executive of Limerick

City and County Council was satisfied that they were well governed. He acknowledged the

need for a review and highlighted that if the DACs moved to a national governance framework

they would no longer be considered local companies.

The Director Planning and Place-Making, informed the Members that the CEO of Limerick

Twenty Thirty DAC gave a good detailed update to the board members before he departed as

CEO of Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC.

The Mayor believed that if the Chairs of each DAC and the boards worked with the Executive

of the Council it would be a more collaborative approach to achieving outcomes, and that

changing the DACs to run under this proposed model would be helpful when applying for

funding.

The Mayor advised that the governance review will outline the skillset needed for an effective

board and further advised that an evaluation panel would decide on the suitable members of

the board for each DAC.

Following lengthy discussions, the Executive and the Members agreed it was very good to

debate the progress of the three Limerick DACs at this Special Meeting, and to understand

the potential for moving forward. Some Members still expressed their concern at the

possibility that Elected Members would no longer sit on the boards, stressing the local

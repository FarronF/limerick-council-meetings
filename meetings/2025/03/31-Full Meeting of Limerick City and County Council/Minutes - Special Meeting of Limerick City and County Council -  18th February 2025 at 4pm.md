The Príomh Chomhairleoir thanked all present for attending the Special Meeting which he

had called to pass a Vote of Sympathy on the passing of former Member and Chairman of

Limerick County Council, Eddie Wade, RIP. He said Eddie had represented the Castleconnell

Electoral Area and was Chairman of the Council on a number of occasions. He had also served

as a TD for the Limerick East constituency. He served as Vice-Chairman of Limerick GAA and

had attended all All-Ireland Finals up to the pandemic. He added that Eddie would be deeply

missed and his thoughts and prayers were with his family and friends.

Members thanked the Príomh Chomhairleoir for calling the Special Meeting on the sad

passing of their former colleague. They too noted that Eddie was first elected as a Member

of Limerick County Council in 1979 and had retained his seat at every subsequent Local

Election until his retirement in 2014. He was elected as Chairman of the Council in 1986/1987,

1988/89, 1989/90 and again in 2004/2005.

Members paid tribute to him saying that he was a great servant to his community and had

always advocated for the elderly and disadvantaged. He was a man of great faith and he

looked after those people he represented to the best of his ability. He was a true Gael who

was always interested in local affairs and he would be a great loss to his family. His three

loves were his family, the GAA and Fianna Fáil and he was deeply passionate about all three.

They went on to say that Eddie had derived huge satisfaction when he won his Dáil seat in

2007 and that he was great company, a great colleague and a great Gael who would long be

remembered in politics and in GAA circles.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir read apologies and condolences on behalf of the Mayor who was

unable to be present.

The Director General, on his own behalf and that of the Staff, offered his sincere condolences

to Eddie’s family, friends and neighbours saying that he was a larger than life character and

an incredible public servant who always had public service at heart.

The Meeting concluded with a silent prayer.

In addition, he noted the desperate condition of the roads in West Limerick due to the recent

weather conditions and pointed out the need for emergency funding from the Government

Department to assist with this.

Councillor Keary seconded the Motion.

Councillors M. Ryan and L. Galvin

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor Galvin.

Friendship Agreement between Limerick and Savannah

Circulated, report of the Head of Trade and Investment, dated 16th January, 2025

The report stated that a delegation from the City of Savannah would be travelling to

Limerick on 17th February, 2025, led by Mayor Van Johnson, with the intention of establishing

a Friendship City Agreement with Limerick. Savannah had a very rich Irish heritage and

ancestry dating back to the mid-18th century. Around the 1840s, the influx increased

dramatically as a large employment boom in Savannah attracted the Irish before and after

the Famine. Accordingly, recent census information stated that one in four Savannahians

claimed to have Irish origin. Savannah had many similarities with Limerick as it had similar

population size and was built on an Estuary linking the Savannah River to the Atlantic Ocean.

There were currently no formal agreements in place between the two cities. However,

there were active members of the Limerick-based Diaspora based in Savannah who often

invited officials from Limerick City and County Council to participate in their annual St.

Patrick’s Day Parade. The Savannah parade was the second largest in the world, after New

York City. Representatives from Savannah visited Limerick in 2023 and 2024 as part of

ongoing efforts to develop trade and investment links between the two cities.

The report went on to say that formal endorsement of a Friendship City relationship

would encourage further collaboration in business, education and culture. It would bring

opportunities for exchanges between business and community. The partnership was about

building friendships, business networks, strengthening ties and fostering mutual

understanding for the benefit of both cities. A Draft Memorandum of Understanding on the

establishment of Friendship Status between the two cities was included at Appendix A. The

City of Savannah administration had reviewed this document and was happy to move forward

on that basis. Accordingly, it was recommended that the Council approve the formal

establishment of Friendship Cities between Limerick and Savannah, Georgia.

Proposed by Councillor Teskey;

Seconded by Councillor Ryan (M);

And Resolved:
---

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the formal establishment

of Friendship Cities between Limerick and Savannah, Georgie.”

Members welcomed the Friendship Agreement and acknowledged the work carried

out by Marty Hogan, Savannah, in building the friendship between Limerick and Savannah.

The Members were informed that a delegation from Savannah would be visiting

Limerick in February and that the Mayor of Savannah would be invited to address the Council.

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir and prior to proceeding to Item No.

5 on the Agenda, Councillor Keary moved the following Emergency Motion:

***“I will move that Limerick City and County Council will write to the new Minister for***

***Transport, Mr. Darragh O’Brien,*** ***TD, and ask him to construct the additional two***

***kilometres of Motorway between Adare and Mount Earl to connect the existing***

***Motorway to the current proposal.”***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Teskey.

Members thanked Councillor Keary for bringing this Emergency Motion and, in doing

so, they welcomed the proposal to look for this additional two kilometres of motorway to be

constructed. They raised concerns about the plans to end the current proposal on a regional

road on the outskirts of Adare village, and stressed there is a need to connect to the existing

motorway to avoid any possible traffic congestion.

In response to the Motion, the Director of Transportation and Mobility, informed the

Members that his team are in active discussions with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) to

extend the current bypass proposal to connect to the existing motorway.

MAYOR’S QUESTIONS

7.

Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

***I will ask the Mayor at the next Meeting has Limerick City and County Council***

***communicated/liaised with Uisce Éireann regarding capacity to deal with increased***

***demand for water and waste facilities whilst roadworks will be carried out, to plan for the***

***future and Ryder Cup and ultimately ensure that we do not have one set of long term***

***roadworks followed by another.***

**REPLY:**

The Councillor's point is well made — you are completely right that proper

planning and coordination will allow disruption to be kept to a minimum.

I sought a response from the relevant team within the organisation and was

informed that Uisce Éireann is aware of the Ryder Cup in Adare and that, as

Uisce Éireann holds sole responsibility for the operational management and

capital investment in water services, the Councillor should direct this query to

Uisce Éireann.

I am also aware, however, that there will be a private workshop with senior

Uisce Éireann staff on 24th February, and this would strike me as an

opportunity for the Councillor to raise this matter, and to seek assurances that

Uisce Éireann will work closely with Limerick City and County Council, the ESB

and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that if the road is to be dug up, it is

dug up once.

As you will know, I am in regular contact with Uisce Éireann with regard to

other matters, but I would be happy to keep this issue on my agenda with Uisce

Éireann.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

***I will ask the Mayor at the next meeting for an update on the first 3 Expert Groups that are***

***being established, how stakeholders are being chosen to sit on these groups and what other***

***Expert Groups are being planned for the future.***

**REPLY:**

**Context: Purpose and Role of Expert Groups:**

The establishment of Expert Groups represents a shift in how policy is developed and

implemented in Limerick in line with the introduction of an Executive Mayor who is not the

head of the Council. Historically, policy was primarily developed by the unelected executive,

with drafts presented to ensure democratic mandate to the relevant Strategic Policy

Committees (SPCs) for recommendation to full Council. While effective, this approach

sometimes involved less early-stage input from experts, stakeholders, and community

representatives.

The revised model is more suited to an elected executive arm and council arm of local

government who both have independent policy roles. It also aims to address the gap

identified above by seeking broader engagement at the initial stages of policy formation.

The Expert Groups are structured to involve subject matter experts, committees, and

stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to contribute their insights and recommendations

from the outset but also to include council members who have an interest in the specific

subject matter. That helps ensure early alignment between the executive and legislative

electoral mandates. This model in conceived in line with best practices in EU institutions,

where as in Limerick now, policy is proposed by one arm with an elected mandate (EU

Commissioners chosen by national governments) and approved by another (the European

Parliament). There, policy development is often enhanced and informed by expert working

groups comprising outside experts, before being reviewed and approved by the European

Parliament. I myself co-led one such group “Finance for Growth” which led to

recommendations which were reflected in the Capital Markets Union proposals from the EU

Commissioner at the time.

Of course, Limerick is at the beginning of its new journey and I am sure that the current

approach will continue to evolve as we learn further but it underscores my commitment to

work in as inclusive and transparent a manner as possible.

**First Three Expert Groups**

 **SME Task Force:**

The work of this task force, established in September 2024, has been led by co-chair Cllr

Peter Doyle. It focuses on enhancing Limerick’s pro-business environment and supporting

small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
---
17

 A project initiation meeting was held in November 2024 to outline the programme of

work, to include an urgent review of the recommendations from my 2020 SME

recovery report, proposals for updating of the report and to re-establish a focus on

the delivery of these recommendations.

 Membership selection was carried out by Councillor Doyle and a member of the Trade

and Investment Team, ensuring a broad and diverse make-up.

 Findings and recommendations will in time be reported to the Economic

Development, Enterprise, and Tourism SPC.

 **Heritage and Public Nature Parks Expert Group:**

Co-chaired by Cllr Sean Hartigan, this group will inform a master plan to improve access to

heritage sites and public nature parks across Limerick.

 A Project Charter is nearing completion, and an Executive Parks and Landscape Officer

will join the team in February 2025.

 The group’s work will be initially informed by the Blue-Green Ring Master Plan and the

Limerick Biodiversity Action Plan, and on-going public consultation. This is expected to

be completed in Q1 2025.

 Stakeholder meetings and site visits will then begin in Q2 2025, with a final list of ideas

for a master plan presented in September 2025.

 **Homelessness and Addiction Expert Group:**

This group is being led by co-chair Cllr Sarah Beasley, and is tasked with addressing

homelessness and addiction as part of the Mayoral Programme.



Membership selection is currently being carried out by Cllr Beasley and a member of

the council’s Housing Support Services Team, and is expected to be finalised in the

coming days. The group will include statutory bodies, experts, and community

stakeholders.



The group’s inaugural meeting is scheduled for early February 2025.



The group intends to first produce a stocktake of the existing situation by the end of

H1 2025, which will be shared with the Home and Social Development SPC.



The group will then work to help inform the preparation of the Mid-West Region

Homelessness Action Plan 2026-2029, expected to go to SPC and Full Council by the

end of 2025.

 **City Centre Revitalisation Expert Group**

While not among the first of the announced groups, this group has been set up and I have

asked Cllr Maria Donoghue to be co-chair. This group will include representatives of trader

groups, Limerick Chamber, businesses, youth groups, sports facilities and residents in the

City Centre to monitor the implementation of the existing measures affecting the City

Centre and develop new actions to respond to new or on-going challenges. Membership

of this groups is being finalised by myself and Cllr Donoghue and the group is also expected

to have its first meeting in mid-February 2025.
---
18

You may be aware that I have already engaged with some stakeholders regarding their

potential involvement in this group. For example, before Christmas, I met with a

representative of the City Centre Traders to discuss their priorities. During our

conversation, I highlighted the importance of transparency and fairness for all members

participating in this group and that openly sharing information about membership would

be most helpful in building trust and equity among all participants.

**Future Expert Groups**

These groups have already proven to be a valuable way to begin to gather data and diverse

perspectives, informing my own thoughts on the relevant policies or actions to be proposed

to the full council for approval in line with reserved functions. As my term progresses, new

areas of focus may emerge, and I may establish additional Expert Groups to address these

needs. For example, I am already considering the creation of a similar group to help me and

advise me on actions that support a holistic development of the Ballinacurra, Rathbane, and

Toppins Field areas of the city.

Throughout my term, I have already envisioned the following additional groups as set out in

the More for Limerick Programme.

1. Mayoral Forum for local SMEs to connect with FDI companies

2. AI Smart Solutions Expert Group (government, academia, and industry collaboration)

3. Expert Working Group for Limerick’s creative sector growth

4. Medical Treatment in Limerick Expert Group

5. Colbert Quarter Implementation Committee

6. Limerick 2030 and Development Plan Implementation Committee

7. Local Implementation Subgroup for Limerick 2030 and housing projects

8. Working Group with the Department of Housing for modular housing

9. Steering Group for UNESCO Heritage status for Limerick’s residential and industrial heritage

10. Steering Group for a vibrant and safe night-time economy in Limerick City Centre

11. Countywide Night-Time Economy Implementation Group

12. Group for expedited planning processes for sustainable energy projects

13. Group with builders, developers, and construction professionals to address project delays

14. Working Group with hotels and short-term accommodation representatives to pre-plan

tourism needs for events like the Ryder Cup

15. Steering Group for city centre stakeholder representation (traders, businesses, youth

groups, etc.)

16. Task Force within Limerick PI 2040 Delivery Board to address blockages in primary health

care centre development

17. Mental Health Task Force

18. Preventative Medicine Task Force

A number of Councillors have already expressed a particular interest in one or more of these

subject areas. If others also come forward which they are invited to do, I shall endeavour as

new groups are set up to reflect their preferences and willingness to get involved.
---
19

Of course, I also expect other subject or geographical areas to warrant new groups over my

term but I would prefer to concentrate on getting the ones above established in waves which

can be accommodated by the staffing of my office and up and running before adding others.

During discussions, Councillor Benson outlined the following – (i) the need to include

the right representatives on the Group for Homelessness and Addiction Expert Group; (ii) she

requested that representatives across various sectors would be selected for the

committee; (iii) she stressed the need for a service user to sit on the group, and the

importance of ensuring this user representative would be supported following discussions at

these meetings;

In response to Councillor Benson’s question and concerns, the Mayor agreed that it is

important to get the right people on the export groups. He acknowledged that she has raised

valid questions and it was agreed that the Mayor, Councillor Benson and Councillor Beasley,

Chair of the Expert Group, would discuss these matters in advance of the selection process.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the agenda were circulated to all Members prior

to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

9.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

I will ask at the next Meeting what the Council's supplies of salt were at the start of the cold

period earlier this month and if all those supplies have been exhausted.

**REPLY:**

On 1st January 2025, Limerick City and County Council had a total of 2,200 tons

of salt stock in our depots. During the cold period from 1st January 2025 to 15th

January 2025, multiple surface treatments were carried out using a total of

2,150 tons of salt. During this period, salts stocks were also replenished. On

15th January 2025, there was 1,170 tons of salt in stock, with additional

deliveries expected shortly.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

I will ask at the next Meeting can you detail how Limerick City and County Council has liaised

with Clare County Council and UL regarding plans for the upgrade of the Black Bridge in

Plassey, in the context of the Plassey Bank Project, and outline the timeline for the

commencement and completion of these works.

**REPLY:**

The Limerick to Scariff Greenway project is being managed by Waterways

Ireland, which is currently at the route selection stage and The Black Bridge is

being considered as part of that process. Limerick City and County Council is

part of a project steering group for the project and has engaged with other key

stakeholders, including Clare County Council, as part of that group. Should The

Black Bridge be identified as being on the emerging preferred route for the

project, then further assessment will follow, and this will be driven by
---
20

Waterways Ireland who are managing the scheme for Transport Infrastructure

Ireland.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

I will ask at the next meeting for the official monthly head count of rough sleepers for the

past six months.

**REPLY:**

The Homeless Action Team report our rough sleeper numbers quarterly to the

Department. Below is a snapshot of the most recent submission covering July

2024 to December 2024.

It should be noted that individual persons can be counted in each 4 categories

of the return as there is a lot of crossover between the individuals on each line

and many of them are counted on all 4 lines of the return throughout the

quarter.

At our annual rough sleeper count which took place in December, we counted

21 rough sleepers which is close to the figure from our Quarter 4 return.

Our Outreach Team from Ana-Liffey have worked extremely hard throughout

the year building relationships with many of the people who are rough sleeping

and have encouraged them to contact the Homeless Action Team in an effort

to get them to avail of services. Many of the people rough sleeping have

serious challenges around addiction and mental health and the Outreach Team

find it takes time to build the level of trust before they will engage.

The Outreach Team will also signpost rough sleepers to other services that are

available, for instance, the Drop-In Centre managed by St. Vincent de Paul, or

towards the HSE for health issues, and they will continue to engage with them

in an effort to ultimately get them into accommodation services.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

I will ask at the next Meeting for resources available to Limerick Council for complaints of

animal welfare issues, including horses, during the recent freezing weather.

(Image omitted)
---
21

**REPLY**:

Animal Health and Welfare functions, as set out under the Animal Health and

Welfare Act 2013, lie within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food

and the Marine (DAFM). Where the Council receives complaints of suspected

animal cruelty or welfare issues, they are reported to the DAFM Vets unit on

the ground in Limerick.

The Council Horse Control Team operates under the Control of Horses Act

1996. Under the Act, the Council has the power to seize and detain any horse

found straying on public lands. Horses are detained at the Council contracted

Pound for five days to allow any horse owner to make themselves known to

the Council and reclaim them. If its owner does not reclaim the horse after five

days, it is re-homed to a horse charity. Seizures of stray horses are scheduled

regularly, in response to complaints, where Garda support is available.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

I will ask at the next Meeting (a) How much has been spent in years 2023, 2024 and 2025 on

renewal and maintenance works to Askeaton Swimming Pool, and (b) what subvention was

given towards the Pool’s operation in each of its last five years trading.

**REPLY:**

Breakdown of expenditure on renewal and maintenance works are listed as

follows: -

**Renewal and Maintenance Costs**

**Breakdown**

**Year**

**Value**

2023

€510,190.81

2024

€1,585,293.75

2025

€381,105.31

Subvention for the pool’s operation in each of the last five years trading is

listed as follows: -

**Subvention**

2018 € 100,000.00

2019 € 110,000.00

2020 € 140,000.00

2021 € 140,000.00

2022 € 140,000.00

14.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on any additional resources given by Government

for Limerick winter maintenance programme in 2025 and will additional resources be

required if needed later in year.
---
22

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has been collating the costs associated with

the last cold weather event and will be making funding submissions to the

Department of Transport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) shortly.

We have ongoing communication with the Department of Transport and TII in

relation to Winter Maintenance and throughout, if additional resources are

required, we will be making funding submissions to them as needed.

15.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

I will ask at the next Meeting that this Council provide a breakdown of the current number of

legally registered short-term lets (e.g. Airbnb’s) for each of the Limerick City and County Local

Electoral Areas.

**REPLY:**

It is not permitted to rent an entire property for short-term letting (less than

14 days) as all of Limerick City and County Council’s administrative area has

been a Rent Pressure Zone since 31st August 2023. Consequently, the Planning

Authority does not have a breakdown of legally registered short-term lettings.

The Planning Authority investigates cases of potential short-term letting

notified to it under the enforcement provisions of the Planning and

Development Act, 2000 (as amended).

16.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

I will ask at the next Meeting can Limerick Library Headquarters please provide a full annual

breakdown of the number of service users, and the number of library loans issued, at each

location serviced by the Mobile Library over the past five years since January 2020.

**REPLY:**

All 31 Library Authorities in Ireland use a single unified library management

system, hosted by Dublin City Public Library, which tracks service users and

loans across all library branches and mobile libraries nationwide. This system

offers significant benefits, including: (i) cost-effectiveness and efficiencies; (ii)

shared expertise; (iii) innovations such as the facility for patrons to use their

local library card to borrow and return their books at any branch library or

mobile across the country; (iv) the system also allows patrons access to a total

of 13 million stock items held in the Irish Public Library system.

The National Library Management System does not record statistics for

individual mobile library stops as it treats each mobile library service as a single

entity. Therefore, a breakdown of statistics for individual mobile stops is not

recorded by the library management system.

17.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue (to be referred to

Metropolitan District of Limerick)

I will ask at the next Meeting if sites can be identified for the construction of new Community

Centres for Raheen / Mungret / Dooradoyle, given the extent of new housing and the very

significant population increase in these areas.

This Motion was referred to the Metropolitan District of Limerick for consideration.

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council commit to using factual and accurate**

**information, based on credible sources, in this Council’s discussion and debates over the**

**length of its term. In making this commitment, this Council affirms its obligation as a Local**

**Authority, as per Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014,**

**to have regard to the need to: (a) eliminate discrimination; (b) promote equality of**

**opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services, and (c)**

**protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to whom it provides**

**services.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara and seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is committed as a Local Authority to its

obligations under Section 42 of the Human Rights Equality Act which places a

statutory obligation on public bodies to have regard to the need to eliminate

discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect the human rights

of their staff, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies

and plans. The Act states: 2(1) A public body shall, in the performance of its

functions, have regard to the need to—
---
24

(a) eliminate discrimination,

(b) promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons

to whom it provides services, and

(c) protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to whom it

provides services.

The national Guidelines for Local Authorities in the preparation of Corporate

Plans 2024-2029 state “This Duty places a statutory obligation on public bodies

to have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of

obligation and protect the human rights of their staff, customers, service users

and everyone affected by their policies and plans. Local authorities should

properly assess its obligations, and make a genuine effort to embed the human

rights duty within the activities of the local authority under the Corporate

Plan.”

This Duty will be further examined as part of the process to develop and

implement the new Limerick City and County Council Corporate Plan.

**Notices of Motion already dealt with**

The Príomh Chomhairleoir noted that Motions Nos. 20, 21, 22, 23 and 27 had been

dealt with earlier in the Meeting and therefore proceeded to Item No. 24 on the Agenda:

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council calls on employers throughout the region**

**to ensure that all staff in their employ have recourse to first-class menstrual and**

**menopausal care with a focus on best practice in order to set the highest standards and**

**ensure Limerick leads the way at national level with regard to these issues.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan and seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan.

In moving the Motion, Councillor Gavan looked for menstrual and menopausal policies

to be put in place by employers, including products and support for women in the workplace.

In supporting the Motion, Members thanked Councillor Gavan and agreed that more

discussions needed to take place on this matter.

The Mayor added his support to the Motion and outlined the great campaign currently

running in Limerick for breast-feeding and that consideration could be given to running a

similar campaign on this matter.

**respected at all stages of the procurement process.**

**REPLY:**

The Council has a Procurement Policy in place, which is based on the Public

Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU and the Office of Government

Procurement (OGP) Guidelines. Within the EU Directive, it clearly sets out

mandatory exclusion grounds, Article 57; *child labour and other forms of*

*trafficking in human beings.*

In the Procurement Policy it states:

Section 17 - Environmental/Green-Procurement/Social Considerations;

Social considerations, where feasible, will be included to support social

policies in relation to employment opportunities, compliance with

social and labour rights, social inclusion, equal opportunities and

accessibility.

Section 26 - Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty; The Council

has a legal obligation to promote equality, prevent discrimination and

protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users

and everyone affected by their policies and plans.

Contracting authorities shall exclude an economic operator (EO) from

participation in a procurement process where they have established that an

EO has been the subject of a conviction by final judgment for any one of the

mandatory exclusion grounds identified within the Directive.

Governance and Customer Services, would meet with Councillor Benson to discuss the matter

further.

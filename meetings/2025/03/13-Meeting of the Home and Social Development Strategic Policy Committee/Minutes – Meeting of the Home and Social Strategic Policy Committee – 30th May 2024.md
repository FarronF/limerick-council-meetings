case basis.

should be an onus on the supplier to sign off on them and retain the servicing contract.

much and asked if solar panels are considered. Ms. Berkery responded the tenants are very satisfied

following retrofit works and the property is much more energy efficient.

for Toppins Field. Mr. Forde-Bradley advised the trees are not in imminent danger of falling, a

maintenance plan will be put in place and as the trees are not now being removed & the council

does not see it as being a possible planning concern for the local residents.

advised that MMC are 10-50% quicker, there is often a higher quality of work and are broadly cost

neutral at the moment compared to traditional methods. The real saving is on the time perspective.

Bradley confirmed that there will no through road from East to West, and access will come in from

REPLY:

The contractor procured to carry out the footpath restorations works in Effin Graveyard last
year, withdrew his tender in the later part of 2024.

It is intended to retender the footpath restoration works with the view to having works
completed by the end of Q3 of 2025.

7. Question submitted by Councillor Carey

| will ask at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District for a progress update on the
Charleville to Patrickswell Greenway referred to in last year’s Schedule of Works.

REPLY:

Technical Advisors have examined the feasibility of providing a Greenway along the route of
the existing abandoned railway between Patrickswell and Charleville. The study, however,
identified significant delivery challenges for such a scheme, and following consultation with
Tl, it is not considered feasible to progress this scheme at this time.

Cycling and walking infrastructure is however to be provided as part of the N/M20 Cork to
Limerick scheme between Patrickswell and Charleville.

The Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District Office has not received any report on
accidents at Cleary’s Cross junction on the R513. The Roads Engineer has requested an
Garda Siochana to examine their database and advise of reported incidents.

The junction has also heen examined and there is no physical evidence of vehicles leaving
the road and impacting roadside boundaries. However, the Municipal District, as part of
routine maintenance, will upgrade the existing road markings and signage on all approaches
to the junction.

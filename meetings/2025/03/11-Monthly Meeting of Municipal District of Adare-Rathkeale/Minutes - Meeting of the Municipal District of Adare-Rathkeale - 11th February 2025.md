works were required to reduce burst water mains and water outages. He further advised

include twenty four hour road closures at various locations along the route of the scheme

of an operator for the Askeaton Pool and Leisure complex.

Limerick City and County Council would issue a formal statement with regard to the

status of the upgrade works and the appointment of an operator when the process of

securing an operator is complete in order to alleviate the frustrations of the local

community and surrounds of Askeaton.

Upgrade works to the Askeaton Pool and Leisure facility are not yet

complete but are nearing substantial completion.

The Council are liaising with a potential operator at the moment,

however, it is difficult to advise an opening date at this time given the

process is still on-going.

preferred option for flood defences along the River Maigue and Adare Stream. This option

has been shaped by extensive analysis of hydrological, environmental, heritage, and

archaeological factors, ensuring it provides robust flood protection while respecting

Adare's sensitive context. The next step is to seek Office of Public Works's approval to

proceed to planning. Once approved, a detailed planning application will be submitted to

An Bord Pleanála in the second quarter of this year. This submission is a critical milestone

towards implementing the necessary flood relief measures to safeguard the Adare

**5.Housing Directorate**

**Part 8 Procedure – Twenty No. Housing Units at Ballycummin Road, Raheen, Limerick**

Circulated, Report of the Senior Engineer, LA Housing Construction and Maintenance dated 11th

February, 2025 and enclosed Mayor’s Report dated 16th January, 2025 setting out details in

relation to the proposed development of Twenty No. Housing Units at Ballycummin Road, Raheen,

Limerick. The report had been prepared in accordance with Section 179(3)(a) of the Planning and

Development Act 2000 (as amended) and Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations,

2001 (as amended) and noted that it was proposed to proceed in accordance with Section 8 of the

report.

The Senior Executive Quantity Surveyor, LA Housing Construction & Maintenance, gave a

presentation to the Members on the proposed Part 8 procedure of Twenty No. Housing Units at

Ballycummin Road, Raheen, Limerick.

Members thanked the team for the presentation and raised the following observations on the

proposed part 8:

 Members welcomed the units designed for people living with disabilities, which will be

managed by Enable Ireland, and highlighted how these units will be of huge benefit giving

people living with disabilities the opportunity to live independently with support;

 Members supported the need for more Housing in Limerick;

 Some Members raised concerns over the height of the proposed developments, suggesting

it was out of context with the development in the area, while other Members welcomed

the development as proposed;

 They expressed concern over the number of car park spaces being removed as part of the

development;

 Members referred to the cost of the development and queried if there was a cost

implication if the height of the proposed development was reduced.

In responding to the Members queries, the Director of Housing outlined that if the proposed Part

8 Development was reduced in height then there would be a cost implication. She informed them

that the same fixed costs will apply to build the development at a reduced height.

It was the view of some Members that the Part 8 procedure should go ahead as proposed.

Following discussions, it was proposed by Councillor Talukder and seconded by Councillor

Donoghue to amend the Part 8 as follows:

“The density of the scheme is excessive at this suburban location and represents overdevelopment

of the site. The application is proposing circa 80 units per hectare almost twice the 45 units per

hectare prescribed in the City and County Development Plan for the delivery of housing in this area.

A reduced density could be achieved by reducing the overall height which is out of context with the

established pattern of development in the area. The proposal does not take cognisance of its

immediate context, an area of predominantly two-and three-storey buildings. We would ask that

the amendment includes a mirror sensitive response to the context by reflecting the adjacent

building heights”.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach and on the proposal of Councillor Butler, seconded by

Councillor McSweeney, it was agreed to adjourn the Meeting for 15 minutes.

On the resumption of the meeting Councillor Butler proposed to proceed with the Part 8 with an

amendment to remove the fourth and fifth floors from the proposed development at

Ballycummin Road, Raheen, Limerick, and this was seconded by Councillor McSweeney.

The Cathaoirleach declared that a vote be taken on the proposal of Councillor Butler, seconded by

Councillor McSweeney, to proceed with the Part 8 with an amendment to remove the fourth and

fifth floors from the proposed development at Ballycummin Road, Raheen, Limerick.

**REPLY**: The Council has held a number of discussions with internal departments in the Council in

relation to the proposal of a Sensory Garden at the Walled Garden site in Mungret. The

proposal has also been raised at the Senior Capital Group meeting. The matter is still under

consideration as there is also a request from the Housing Department for residential use of

this site.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the proposed bus route to***

***Mungret Community College, Gaelscoil An Raithín and Limerick East Educate Together be***

***implemented without further delay.***

Submissions from Design Teams are currently being assessed with a view to an appointment

of a Design Team to progress the Sports and Educational Campus at Kilmallock Road. This

follows the Stage 1 Approval received last year from the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage (DHLGH). Upon appointment of the Design Team, the Council

intends to progress a Stage 2 DHLGH application, and upon receipt of Stage 2 Approval, a

relevant Planning submission will be made. Progression to each Stage of the project’s

development is dependent on the appropriate DHLGH stage and associated funding

approval.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick Council advise***

***why the CCTV is not working on the Old Cork Road and when will it be reinstated.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council’s Digital Services CCTV team is responsible for the

installation and operation of Community CCTV cameras, with the primary objective of

maintaining public order and safety. Under Section 38 of An Garda Síochána Act 2005, the

Garda Commissioner has the authority to approve the presence of such cameras, ensuring

that each scheme or individual location is justified, proportionate, and necessary.
---

The CCTV infrastructure installed at the junction of Crossagalla and Bawnmore Road are

not operational. Following the Data Protection Commissioner’s review of CCTV in Limerick,

Limerick City and County Council and An Garda Síochána reviewed over 400 cameras,

including this location, to ensure compliance with An Garda Síochána Act, Data Protection

Act, G.D.P.R and The Law Enforcement Directive. It was determined that cameras at this

location did not meet the required criteria of being justified, proportionate, and necessary.

As a result, the CCTV at this location is not authorised for operation under An Garda

Síochána Act.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can the Roads Department***

the Limerick City and County Council Road operational team. Additional drainage gullies will

also be installed in this area where required once funding for this year’s drainage grant is

confirmed.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if sites can be identified for***

***the construction of new Community Centres for Raheen / Mungret / Dooradoyle, given the extent***

***of new housing and the very significant population increase in these areas.***

**REPLY**: The Council owned land that currently accommodates Dooradoyle Men’s Shed Group is

being explored. As part of the overall project a community group/organisation needs to be

identified which is prerequisite for the sustainability of any such centre. Provision has now

been made under the Development Fund Allocations 2024 to support the pre development

costs in certain areas including the Raheen/Mungret/Dooradoyle area which is essential to

progress such projects.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

Scheme. Limerick City and County Council is working in conjunction with the NTA Park and

Ride Design team to develop the project with the intention of applying for planning

permission in 2025. The M7 J28 Mackey Junction Upgrade Scheme will be developed once

funding is secured.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***Community Liaison Committee due to be established for the Mungret/Raheen/Dooradoyle area***

***as stipulated in the planning conditions in respect to Irish Cement.***

**21.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on all***

***environmental remedial work carried out in the Loughmore Canal and Common in last year and***

***what ongoing remediation works will be completed in 2025.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council received a complaint in June 2021 alleging pollution of the

Loughmore Canal, which initiated a comprehensive investigation under the Local

Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.

Initial investigations revealed elevated readings of Zinc and Phosphorus.

Over the past several years, LCCC has undertaken a variety of detailed investigations to

understand the source and nature of these elevated readings. These actions have included

site surveys, dye testing, water quality sampling, flow monitoring, and CCTV surveys. In

2024, LCCC remained proactive in tackling the issue, continuing their investigations and

introducing new measures to improve the sampling process.

The Council has continued to undertake monthly water quality sampling at two key

locations along the canal: at the outfall and downstream. In November & December 2024,

the sampling procedure was upgraded from grab samples to composite samples in order to

get an accurate reflection of the water quality entering and leaving the canal. This change

is expected to provide a more representative understanding of the water quality.

The water quality monitoring results from November and December 2024 showed an

improvement with no elevated levels of Phosphorus and Zinc, indicating a positive trend

that may reflect the effectiveness of the Council’s ongoing efforts.

Additionally, LCCC has been actively engaging with businesses both internal and external to

the business park linked to the storm sewer system. The Council has been issuing notices

under the Water Pollution Act 1977 when necessary. In 2024, 77 inspections of businesses

were conducted, and 26 notices were issued. The primary issues identified included the
---
12

improper discharge of wastewater from activities like power washing vehicles on-site,

discharges from ventilation equipment to the storm sewer, and other minor

misconnections.

The EPA has also been involved engaging directly with the licensed sites in Raheen Industrial

estate regarding their discharges into the storm sewer. The EPA are currently preparing a

report on their findings which we hope will be completed in the next few weeks.

Furthermore, landowners have submitted an independent report, prepared by Tetra Tech,

to assess the impact of the storm discharge on the Loughmore Canal and surrounding lands.

To ensure a thorough evaluation of this report, LCCC has appointed consultants to review

the Tetra Tech report, with the aim of assessing its findings and determining the

appropriate next steps for further action.

Looking ahead to 2025 we plan to continue the monthly sampling program, reviewing the

results regularly and adapting the approach as necessary. We will also be reviewing the

report from the EPA once it is received and will take appropriate actions based on its

findings. Additionally, with the completion of the review report from the appointed

consultants, LCCC will implement any necessary actions recommended.

LCCC remains committed to liaising with businesses discharging into the canal, ensuring

that they adhere to best practices. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and

adjust its approaches as needed.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many presentation of***

***bins warnings and fines have been given in Limerick city centre in the last 5 years.***

**REPLY**: In the last 5 years 114 warnings and 172 fines have been issued for Presentation of Waste

offences in the Metropolitan District of Limerick.

**23.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council provide a***

***status report on the 2GoCup scheme and whether there is any plan to extend it in 2025.***

**REPLY**: The current 2GoCup scheme is part of a wider National project i.e. MyWaste Green hub -

Phase 2. There is a further MyWaste Green Hub planned for Phase 3 in Limerick City Centre.

The objective of the MyWaste Green Hub projects is to –

(1) Promote the FREE www.mywaste.ie/business toolkit which assists the business

community to properly separate their waste and so promote the circular economy

(2) Minimise waste and encourage a move to reusable items instead of single use again to

promote the circular economy.

The MyWaste project is ongoing and progressing steadily with businesses being visited on

an individual basis by a waste advisor. A number of coffee outlets in Limerick have decided

independently to move to reusables in support of sustainability. This initiative is supported
---
13

by the ongoing distribution to the public of reusable coffee cups by Limerick City and County

Council throughout Limerick city and county

**24.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on any public***

***art works that have been approved and are scheduled for completion in 2025.***

**REPLY**: A three year biodiversity mural project in Limerick city and county has been approved for

funding from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This project is being developed and

delivered in partnership with Draw Out Limerick, Planning and Placemaking and Limerick’s

biodiversity officer. Work is continuing on identifying suitable locations and by the end of

2025 it is anticipated that a number of biodiversity murals in Limerick city centre will have

been completed. This public art project aims to create high impact, true to life, high quality

biodiversity artworks.

**25.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the motion***

***passed at the May 2023 Metropolitan District meeting "that this Council draft a maintenance***

***plan***

period expires this year.

**26.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***proposed new City Centre Library to include most up to date quantity surveyor costings and***

***details on any funding applications submitted.***

**REPLY:** In June 2015, Limerick City and County Council submitted an application to the Department

of Community and Rural Development for funding of €5m, which was the maximum grant

allowable under the **Libraries Capital Programme 2016-2021** for a new city library for

Limerick on the Opera site.

In February 2016, an initial sum of funding of €2m was approved and ring-fenced by the

Department for the design and development of the project.

In July 2018, Stage 1 Approval in Principle application was submitted to the Department

and subsequently approved in February 2019.

In May 2023, a comprehensive Stage 2 application for the planned Limerick City Library was

submitted to the Department under the **Libraries Capital Programme 2023** **–** **2027**.

In April 2024, the Department announced the approval of 11 capital projects for funding.

However, Limerick was not included on this list.
---
14

We were informed that, which the Stage 2 Design Plan submitted for the new Limerick city

Library was approved, the project was placed on a waiting list for future funding due to the

limited availability of current Library Capital Funding.

In November 2024, Limerick 2030 issued the tender for the New City Library and the

adjoining office development. As this is a live tender process, the projected costs for this

project are commercially sensitive.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council include:***

**a.*the section of road between the Mackey Roundabout and the Railway Crossing on the***

***Newport Road in the Consultants review being undertaken for the Park and Ride solution and;***

**b.*residents from Rich Hill Woods and Grangewood in Stakeholder Engagement as part of the***

***Consultant's review.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Reale and agreed.

**REPLY**: In conjunction with the NTA, the Council is preparing planning documentation for a Strategic

Park & Ride facility on lands to the West of Mackey Junction in accordance with the

objectives of the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS).

This project will identify and examine the best site and site layout to facilitate the various

sustainable modes within a new facility to facilitate modal interchange and in particular

access to the high frequency city Bus Services (Under Bus Connects) as well as other

strategic Bus Services to meet modal share objectives.

This project will not address any potential deficiencies in the existing hinterland road

network including the location identified above on the Newport Road.

However, we are exploring other options. Due to the constraints of the road curtilage,

providing a footpath connecting Rich Hill Woods and Grangewood estates would require

the acquisition of additional lands. This could be achieved either through a Compulsory

Purchase Order (CPO) or by agreement, along with a road realignment. The Roads

Department will engage with the Department of Transport to assess viable options in this

regard. An update will be provided once this process is completed.

In addition, the LCCC Active Travel Section has committed to funding a permeability

measure with the communities interlinking the estates which can also be advanced.

existing support services. The purpose of the proposed Humanitarian Hub needs to be

established and once this has been done it can then be considered having regard to the

existing community facility infrastructure in the area.

Following discussions, the Administrative Officer, Community Department, agreed to meet with

Councillor Slattery to discuss the matter further.

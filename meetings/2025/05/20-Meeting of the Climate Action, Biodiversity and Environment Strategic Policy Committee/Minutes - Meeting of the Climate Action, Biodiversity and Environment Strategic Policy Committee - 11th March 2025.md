members. He requested all members to familiarise themselves with the Standing Orders for

Strategic Policy Committees, he reminded members that the role of the SPC was in Policy, not

Item 1 – Limerick City and County Council Biodiversity Action Plan 2025-2030 – presentation - Ms. Sinéad

McDonnell, Biodiversity Officer.

Ms. McDonnell gave a detailed presentation on the draft of the new Limerick City and County Council

Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP) and requested that the Committee recommend the plan for adoption

at the Full Council on March 31st.

The Biodiversity Plan is based on Ireland’s 4th National Biodiversity Action Plan 2023-2030 (NBAP). The

draft plan has adapted the five objectives from the NBAP for Limerick. It consists of 66 Actions and

requires a ‘whole of Limerick City and County Council’ approach to Biodiversity. Seventeen policies feed

into the plan as well as seven different pieces of legislation. The engagement process in creating the

LBAP began in Quarter 2 of 2024 included public consultation on an LBAP discussion paper from April

to June 2024 and a public consultation on the draft LBAP between November 2024 and January 2025.

The Limerick Biodiversity Forum supported, informed and advised on the Discussion Paper and draft

LBAP and in February 2025, the draft was proposed and seconded during a meeting of the Forum.

Cllr. Leddin thanked Ms McDonnell for the presentation and acknowledged the hard work of members

on the Biodiversity Forum.

A discussion took place with regard to the engagement process and the value of the plan to biodiversity

and conservation programmes in Limerick. Members thanked Ms McDonnell for the presentation.

Cllr Collins proposed that the Plan be recommended to the Full Council for adoption. Cllr. Hickey O’Mara

seconded the proposal.

Mr. Finn outlined the Environment & Climate Action projects in the Mayoral Programme, in particular

the creation of high-level expert group to develop a masterplan for heritage and public nature parks

across the county. He highlighted some key objectives such as; investing in the public realm of key

towns in the County, developing community projects, promoting green therapy initiatives, leveraging

the natural assets across the county and city and other objectives such as reducing our carbon footprint,

tree planting and the provision of seed packs to promote gardening.

A discussion took place among members with regard to the breadth of function within the department

and members requested the presentation be circulated to the members for future reference.

A range of topics were further explored by members including;

Cemeteries - Cllr. Secas asked for an update on the columbarium wall due to be installed in Kilmurry

Cemetery. Ms. C Lynch advised funding was in place since last year but due to high consultancy costs

the issue is still ongoing. In addition alternative funding for the project has been sourced and it go out

to tender shortly. Mr. Finn advised there is minimal funding nationally for developing new/repairing

existing cemeteries and that other sources of funding including a loan were being explored to support

this activity.

Members queried the regulation of unauthorised structures in cemeteries. Mr. S McNamara responded

that a number of strategies were being pursued as the current regulatory system is not working. A

permit application system exists but is challenging to enforce. The Council have ongoing engagement

with communities, monument artists and suppliers in cases of unauthorised structures but the process

can be drawn out and largely ineffective. A national register is being considered with a view to

sanctioning sculptors nationally. A Graveyard Strategy for Limerick City and County Council is being

drafted and will be published this year.

Tree planting – Members discussed tree planting in general and the LCCC Tree Planting Policy. Cllr.

Collins then asked where we are getting the seeds for the tree planting initiative, are they native. Mr.

Finn advised that they are native seeds, there is a publication and media going out this week, which is

Tree Week. The Council will provide free seeds at three locations in the city/county.

Roundabout planting – Cllr Leddin raised the Shannon Bridge roundabout and the need for regular

maintenance. Ms. Lynch advised that we were actively looking for sponsorship for the Shannon Bridge

roundabout and that any suggestions would be welcome. She outlined the lack of funding available for

existing playgrounds, currently only €20,000 annually.

Bring Banks – Members raised problem illegal dumping at bring banks and the Mungret Recycling

facility. Ms. Hourigan responded by advising that six bring banks have been approved for the installation

of CCTV by the oversight committee and that cameras would be installed over the next couple of weeks.

Playgrounds -Members discussed playground maintenance and raised concerns around the lack of

national funding available for playgrounds. Cllr Leddin suggested writing to the relevant Minister to

lobby regarding the topic. Cllr Collins outlined her concerns which extend to funded pressure on the

upkeep of greenways and supported the suggestion of writing to the Minister to request funding for

the for upkeep and maintenance.

Item 3 – Irish Business against Litter, Update and Progress Report – Ms. Sinéad Hourigan, Administrative

Officer

Ms. Hourigan gave a detailed presentation on the results of the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL)

report for 2024. Limerick City and Galvone were both given a position of 37th out of 40 towns/cities

surveyed which was quite disappointing. Main areas of Limerick City received ‘A’ ratings including

O’Connell Street, People’s Park and Colbert Station whereas poor grades were reserved for some

laneways, vacant sites and basements in the city. Ms Hourigan then presented details of the work being

completed by Council staff to rectify litter blackspots. She described the work carried out in 2024 and

expressed frustration that improvements in certain areas were not acknowledged in the most recent

report – the vacant building between 30 Cecil Street and Engine Buildings being cited as an example.

Members welcomed the work being done on litter management around the City and County and

highlighted several challenges including management of the laneways in the city, bring banks and

persistent illegal dumping in certain locations. Members also highlighted and praised the work of

community and voluntary groups around the city and county and underlined the importance of the

work they undertake in cleaning their communities.

Item 4 – Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

Cllr. Hickey O’Mara (deputising on behalf of Cllr O’Donovan) proposed the Notice of Motion. Cllr Leddin

advised that non-members are entitled to bring Notices of Motion before the SPC and to attend.

I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a cost price municipal

refuse collection scheme be piloted in illegal dumping hot-spots in the city including St. Mary’s Park,

Ballinacurra Weston, Lenihan Avenue, Coonagh/Clondrinagh, Johnsgate and Kilmallock Road.
---
Response:

In October 2024, under the Anti-Dumping Initiative a free Bulky Waste collection was offered to all

residents in St Mary’s Park, Ballinacurra Weston and the Hyde road area. It is intended to repeat this

initiative in 2025.

In November 2024, the Minister for Environment, Climate Action and Communications asked the

Department to commission a comprehensive study to explore the feasibility and benefits of

transitioning Ireland's municipal waste collection market from its current model of side-by-side

market competition to a franchise tendering system for local authority areas or regions.

Study will include –



Comparative analysis with other jurisdictions



Legislative & policy changes required



Cost implications for both consumers and industry



Potential environmental impacts

Consultants are to be appointed in coming weeks and I recommend awaiting an outcome of this

report in advance of taking actions at local level that may be superseded by the recommendations of

the feasibility study.

This response is to be circulated to all members.

This concluded the business of this meeting.

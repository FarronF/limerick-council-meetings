The Príomh Chomhairleoir extended his deepest sympathy to her sons Timothy,

Morgan, Brian and Gregory, stepchildren Deirdre, Anthony, Desmond and Joan, her extended

family, neighbours and friends, her nephew, Councillor Joe Leddin, and relative Councillor Joe

Pond.

Councillor Leddin thanked the Príomh Chomhairleoir for calling the Special Meeting.

He also expressed his appreciation to his colleagues and the officials for their kind words on

the passing of his aunt. He referred to Kathleen as a very determined lady with a huge

appreciation for community organisations and events, includingFéile Luimnigh and the

Community Games. He said Kathleen loved to encourage young people to get involved in

Sport and the Arts. He echoed the sentiments of the Príomh Chomhairleoir and commended

Kathleen for her courage and passion in local politics. Some of her proudest moments were

being elected as the 817th Mayor of Limerick, an historic title as she was the last Mayor of

Limerick prior to the merger of Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council. She also

took huge pride in her son Brian’s election to the Council and subsequently to Dáil Éireann.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir noted that the Mayor sent his apologies as he was absent

on Council business and extended his sincere sympathies to Kathleen’s family, friends and

wider community.

The Members joined in the tributes paid and associated themselves with the Vote of

Sympathy, in particular Members noted Kathleen’s instrumental work and commitment to

the Westfields Wetlands. They, too, acknowledged her commitment and work ethic for her

community and said she was a trailblazer in leading the way for women in politics. They

described her as a very pleasant, warm and friendly person and considered that she was an

inspiration to many people and an example of what it meant to give back to the city; she was

a dedicated public representative, with a genuine empathy and compassion for people, and

had given years of public service to the people of Limerick. Members added that she was also

a great story-teller and a great people’s person who was a highly regarded and respected

politician, had represented Limerick with distinction, and would be a huge loss to her wider

community. Councillor Pond, in particular, fondly remembered his childhood visits with

Kathleen.

The Director General, on behalf of the Management and Staff, joined in extending his

condolences to Kathleen’s family, friends and former colleagues. He said her tenure as a

Councillor, and Mayor, was marked by her dedication to the social and economic

development of Limerick; and that she was as a dedicated and passionate public servant who

was always courteous in her dealings with staff.

Senator Maria Byrne, who was present in the Chamber, extended her condolences to

Kathleen’s family, referring to her election to Limerick City Council, with Kathleen, in 1999. In

paying tribute to her, she described her as a great lady and a great colleague who was very

knowledgeable and was also a very sincere politician. She acknowledged her commitment to

Limerick and, in particular, her community. She extended her sympathies to her family,

Councillor Leddin and Councillor Pond.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir welcomed everyone to the Council Chamber and stated that he

had been asked to call the Special Meeting following a request from Councillors Benson,

Gavan, O’Donovan, Hickey-O’Mara, Reale, Secas to discuss the issue set out in the Agenda as

follows:

“To discuss the budget and available funding for the voids programme this year, given

the fact that as of March 2025 there is already a €1.5M deficit in the projected cost of

refurbishing current listed vacant units.”

The Director of Housing informed the Members that the average cost to refurbish a void was

approximately €48,000. However, with only €11,000 in funding per property, and with

approximately 10 properties per month coming back as voids, it was very difficult to keep up

with demand.

The Senior Engineer, Local Authority Housing Maintenance, gave a PowerPoint presentation

to the Members on housing voids. He informed the Members that within Limerick City and

County Council housing stock of 6,192 of which 113 were awaiting minor repairs and 103 were

awaiting major refurbishment. As part of the presentation, he reviewed the voids over the

previous 12 months, the costs involved and the proposals going forward as follows:

The Senior Engineer referred to the initial two funding streams for voids - €50,000 towards

derelict properties under Category 3 and 4; and €11,000 towards minor repairs under

Category 1 and 2. However, he informed the Members that the €50,000 had been suspended

and the €11,000 had not increased despite construction inflation of 114% since 2014.

The Senior Engineer advised that in 2022, a €5 million fund was set up by the Council to

address deficits related to voids. This fund was financed through a combination of its own

resources and the repurposed Troy Studio Loan. He noted that the Fund was specifically set

up to deal with the shortfall in funding for voids but has since been depleted. He further

advised that, any additional funding outside the €11,000 must come from the Council’s own

resources.

The Senior Engineer provided an overview of the expenditure incurred to refurbish Void

properties between 2022 and 2024. He noted that, the DHLGH covered the full refurbishment

costs in 2023 for all Void properties completed by December of that year.

The Senior Engineer then presented the proposals for going forward, highlighting the

following key priorities:

 A business case for extra funding to be made before Quarter 4, 2025.

 Energy efficiency retrofit funding to include void works.

 Using Supplygov.ie framework to ensure better value for money was achieved.

 Bringing units up to minimal rental standards.

Councillor Benson thanked the Príomh Chomhairleoir for calling the Special Meeting. She

referred to the serious need for housing and the ongoing housing emergency. She stressed

the need for more help from the Department and emphasised that the €11,000 grant had not

increased in line with inflation.

Members welcomed the Special Meeting to discuss the available funding for the voids

programme this year and the urgent need for additional supports from the Department. The

following issues were raised:

 Members expressed their concerns at the lack of funding and asked if the Department

was aware of the Council’s current situation in relation to voids.

 Members expressed their disappointment at the length of time a house remained empty

after becoming vacant and asked for clarification on the turn-around time to get these

voids back into stock.

 Members queried how many tradespeople were employed by the Council and what type

of tradespeople.

 Members queried if other Local Authorities were in a similar situation.

 Members queried if it was more efficient to go for “3 Quotes” for minor works.

 Members suggested scoping work could be carried out prior to the tenant vacating the

property.

 Members queried if there was a minimum BER requirement for a re-let.

 Members sought a breakdown per district of the following – Schedule of Costs and No. of

Units.

In response to the Members queries, the Senior Engineer stated the Department is aware of

the lack of funding and the urgent need to return Voids to use to meet the housing demands.

He noted that the average re-letting time for voids is approximately 8 months, however, this

can vary depending on the condition of the void. The Members were advised that the Council

has a direct labour crew in the Metropolitan District and the Municipal Districts, which

includes carpenters, plumbers and masonry tradespeople responsible for both the day to day

maintenance and refurbishment of the Council’s housing stock. He noted that other local

authorities have a mix of direct labour and contractors, which is similar to Limerick.

It was agreed that a breakdown of stock would be given to the Members.

Members discussed the need to recruit tradespeople with the required qualified skillset to

actively work on voids as well as day to day maintenance in housing. They requested the

Council consider running a Pilot Apprentice Programme for tradespeople with an

administration element to the training programme. The Mayor supported this initiative.

The Senior Engineer informed the Members that the Council is currently in contact with TUS

to develop an apprenticeship programme and welcomed this initiative, acknowledging the

benefits this would have for the housing maintenance team.

On the proposal of Councillor Benson, seconded by Mayor John Moran the following was

agreed:

“That, we will write to and call on the Government to urgently review the funding

allocation to Local Authorities for voids and to consider the impact that construction

inflation has had on the ability of Local Authorities to refurbish these properties. We

also, call on the Government to review the 4 stage approval process for SHIP

renewals.”

The Mayor supported the Motion and highlighted the need for funding as the Council did not

have the capacity within its own budget. He referred to the need for more housing and how

Limerick must find alternative solutions to this issue. He agreed that some houses were

returned in a reasonable condition but this Local Authority must meet minimal rental

standards before re letting them.

The Senior Engineer advised the Members that the Council would be commencing an

inspection programme of all stock and any issues should be identified during the inspections.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir thanked the staff for their presentation. He referred to the

seriousness of the issue and the need to find solutions.

This concluded the Meeting.

MAYOR’S QUESTIONS

8.

Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

***I will ask the Mayor to work with the Director General and An Garda Síochána to lead a city-***

***wide traffic management campaign around our major education institutions and employers***

***for the wider benefit of local residential communities who are currently suffering from car***

***parking issues on a regular basis.***
---
16

**REPLY:**

The concerns you have raised are completely understandable, and it is clear

that the impact of inconsiderate parking continues to cause issues for many

residents around the city. As you will be aware, the issue of parking problems

in residential areas around the University of Limerick was also raised by

Councillor Elena Secas at the March Meeting of the Metropolitan District

through a Notice of Motion. In response, I agreed to meet with the University

of Limerick (UL) Community Liaison Group and Councillor Secas to explore

possible solutions to the parking challenges in the Castletroy area.

Since November 2023, a Traffic Warden has been assigned to patrol residential

areas in the city, including those near the main Third Level colleges and

University Hospital Limerick. While this increased enforcement has helped to

some extent in reducing parking problems, it is clear that the measures in place

have not fully achieved the desired outcome.

The Council’s Traffic Section remains in regular communications with An Garda

Síochána regarding parking issues in residential areas and during large events

in Limerick city. In 2024, the ‘Think Before You Park’ campaign was launched

by Limerick City and County Council in collaboration with An Garda Síochána

following consultation with a local disability group. This ongoing initiative

highlights the obstructions and hazards caused by improper parking across

Limerick City and County, emphasising the consequences for other road and

footpath users. As part of this campaign, An Garda Síochána continues to

enforce parking regulations across the city. Vehicles issued with fixed charge

notices for parking offences are often marked with information stickers, which

include a QR code directing motorists to the ‘Think Before You Park’ campaign

page on limerick.ie

I do recognise the value of such initiatives. However, I agree that more needs

to be done and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further

at a time that suits us both.

Councillor Galvin welcomed the reply and emphasised the need to make this a city-

wide campaign.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will ask the Mayor at the next Meeting of Limerick Council for an update on the***

***membership, status and priorities of the Limerick Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board***

to the appointment of an additional member with expertise in climate and

transport policy. It is expected that this appointment and others will be

considered at the next meeting of the Delivery Board scheduled for 2nd May,

2025.

The Transport Sub-Group, at its next meeting, will convene with the aim of

progressing a defined set of strategic priorities. These priorities include:

 Reviewing BusConnects Limerick and Connecting Ireland Plans.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the agenda were circulated to all Members prior

to the Meeting and were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

10.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***–*** ***since 1**st*** ***February, 2025, it is now illegal to own an XL Bully***

***Dog unless you have a Certificate of Exemption*** ***–*** ***(a) how many XL Bully Dogs were***

***destroyed; (b) how many exemptions were granted in Limerick; (c) what were the reasons***

***for the exemptions; and (d) what steps has this Council put in place to ensure that all XL***

***Bully Dogs are certified.***

REPLY:

Under the Control of Dogs (XL Bully) Regulations 2024, as of 1 February this

year, it has been illegal to own an XL Bully unless you have a Certificate of

Exemption.

(a) **How many XL Bully Dogs were destroyed:** as of 1 February 2025, 2 XL Bully

dogs have been euthanised in the Dog Shelter.

(b) **How many exemptions were granted in Limerick**: 38 exemption certs have

been issued.
---
18

(c) **What were the reasons for the exemptions:**  the requirements of approval

for an exemption cert were set out under the XL Bully regulations. The

following documents were required:

 Application form submitted within the deadline for applications -

31/01/2025

 Copy of valid Dog Licence.

 Copy of Microchipping Certificate.

 Copy of Veterinary Confirmation of Neutering Status Form.

 Photographic Proof of Identity (Copy of Passport, Drivers Licence,

public services card etc.).

 Proof of Address (Copy of Utility Bill or bank statement within previous

3 months etc.).

Applicants that supplied the required documentation within the deadline

for applications were approved for an exemption.

(d)  **What steps has this Council put in place to ensure that all XL Bully Dogs**

**are certified:** it is the responsibility of each dog owner to apply for a

Certificate of exemption for their XL Bully dog. In advance of the ban

coming into force the Council contacted all owners that had purchased a

dog licence in Limerick that noted the breed as an XL Bully, to remind them

of the requirement for an exemption. In addition, there was a nationwide

media campaign run by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs

to highlight in XL Bully ban and the steps owners were required to take to

exempt their dog.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor B. Collins

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many pre-planning and full planning permissions have***

***been refused or withdrawn since the adoption of the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028***

***based on applicants residing in Level 4 settlements.***

**REPLY:**

This Question was discussed with Councillor Collins. Details of pre-planning

meetings are confidential and therefore cannot be released.

The level of detail required in order to provide an answer for this Question will

require additional time due to the nature of the Question. Work has

commenced on the compilation of the data which will be further examined

once gathered.

***I will ask at the next meeting, (i) How many vacant Council properties do we currently have***

***(ii) What is the projected cost of refurbishing all of these properties (iii) What is this year’s***

***budget for refurbishing these properties and (iv) How much do we get from central***

***government towards the cost, per unit.***

**REPLY:**

The number of vacant properties as of 26th March, 2025, is 226 units, of which

119 houses are Voids.

For the current 119 houses, the projected cost of refurbishing these units is

€5,077,377. For units that will be returned from tenants throughout 2025, the

projected average cost based on 2024 is as follows:

---
20

€2,825,000 has been allocated in the Capital budget in 2025 for Void properties

and €767,672 in the Revenue budget for Pre-Letting Repairs. The total

allocated budget is €3,592,672.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will fund €11,000

towards any void which has not received funding before. For all other vacant

stock, which is not a void, an application for funding can be made.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

***I will ask at the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council has a dedicated fulltime***

***Access Officer, with appropriate seniority and training.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has a number of Access Officers in place, each

in a part-time capacity but with their own areas of responsibility in the areas

of Human Resources, public realm and Council buildings. The group meet on

a monthly basis to review access issues and are drafting an Accessibility

Strategy for the wider organisation in conjunction with their colleagues in

Community Development. The Council also runs regular Disability Awareness

sessions for staff on their responsibilities in this very important area.

15.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

**I will ask at the next Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that all paths and roads**

**maintenance costs for all required works are included in pre-budget workshops in a project-**

**by-project in Q3 and Q4 going forward.**

**REPLY:**

The Road Maintenance Works to be carried out annually are identified on the

Roads Management Database on a triennial basis, as required by the

Department of Transport, (2025-2027 currently in place). These roads are

identified mainly using the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) rating

system, which is a rating system to evaluate the condition of Regional and Local

Roads in Ireland and through representations by Councillors and members of

the public. Finalisation of that list is done by the presentation of the Schedule

of Municipal District Works to the Municipal District for adoption. Changes will

occur from time to time due to funding restrictions, identification of synergies

with other departments and representations. These elements are generally

finalised in January/February of the year in question and when budgets are

known and allocated.

16.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the Housing Department can set out its current projected***

***Per Cent for Art budget across all projects regardless of stage.***

Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney

***I will ask at the next Meeting of Limerick City and County Council for a full yearly breakdown***

***of expenditure on consultants by the Active Travel Team since it was established.***

**REPLY:**

The average percentage of design consultancy spending on Limerick City and

County Council Active Travel capital projects typically falls within the range of

5% to 10% of the total project budget.

These projects, which include infrastructure for cycling, walking, and other

forms of sustainable transport, often require specialized expertise in urban

planning, engineering, and environmental assessments.

Factors influencing consultancy costs on active travel projects include project

complexity, geographic location, and the specific requirements of local

authorities or government bodies.

Spend on design consultancy was as follows: -

2021 -

€ 699,566.81

2022 - € 722,052.45

2023 - €1,407,154.37

2024 - €1,627,209.69

**Total -** **€4,455,983.32**

The overall non-payroll costs for the same period and same schemes amount

to €63,495,994.75, so our consultancy fees account for 7.01% of the non-

payroll costs to date which is below the expected outturn of 10% not

withstanding fees are still being incurred as schemes are progressing.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many properties our Authority had agreed to purchase***

***in 2024 under Notice to Quit, Tenant in Situ and Rightsizing options, what the relating***

***purchase monies amount to, and when completions are expected.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) is ‘sale agreed’ on 14 Tenant-in-Situ

properties from 2024 in Limerick City and County.

Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) funded by Limerick City and County Council

are also ‘sale agreed’ on 14 Tenant-in-Situ properties from 2024.

Limerick City and County Council is ‘sale agreed’ on four rightsizing properties

from 2024.

Purchase monies are not approved by the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage at this time for the ‘sale agreed’ properties.

Therefore, completion dates are not known.
---
23

The sales relating to Tenant-in-Situ properties are on hold pending receipt of

the official Circular from the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Heritage which will detail the 2025 budget allocation for Limerick City and

County Council for all acquisitions including the Tenant-in-Situ Scheme.

Overall, Limerick City and County Council has 48 acquisitions on its tracker that

are approaching ‘sale agreed’ (i.e., at proposal stage).

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has advised all

Local Authorities that there will be no funding for the acquisition of properties

relating to rightsizing in 2025. Alternative options are being explored currently

for the four rightsizers identified above that Limerick City and County Council

is ‘sale agreed’ with.

Once the Council receives notification on the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage Circular and Budget Allocation relating to the

Acquisitions Programme for 2025, we will keep Elected Members informed of

the specific conditions associated with it.

NOTICES OF MOTION

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor N. Stokes

***I will move at the next Plenary Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that this Council***

***examine the possibility of securing funding for the Irish Chamber Orchestra's Education and***

***Community Engagement work. The funding is essential to enable them to continue their***

***offering of programmes free-of-charge to schools and community groups, providing access***

***to music and the arts for those who may require it.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Stokes and seconded by Councillor Hickey-

O’Mara.

**REPLY:**

The Irish Chamber Orchestra (ICO) provides free, inclusive music education to

children and young people in Limerick through its education programme. The

programme is offered to circa 500 children and young people on a weekly basis

and tuition is given in instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass.

All instruments are provided by the ICO, along with high quality tuition and

opportunities to perform.

Limerick City and County Council provides annual funding of €11,000 to the

Irish Chamber Orchestra under the Arts programme. In 2025, work in

cooperation with the Arts Office will be further developed, through the ICO

providing a small number of ‘Meet the Musician’ workshops for Transition Year

students in the Autumn. This will form part of the Limerick City and County

Council Artists in Schools Scheme 2025, which is also funded by the Arts

Council. In other supports, it has been agreed that quartets from the ICO will
---
24

be invited to play in two concerts under the Arts Office Excellence in Rural Arts

Programme 2025.

It is the view of the Arts Office that the Irish Chamber Orchestra’s education

and community programme is valuable and impactful. However, the Arts

Office does not have resources under its budget allocation to increase current

budgeted supports to the ICO in 2025. Consideration could be given to a

proposal or request for increased arts programme funding for 2026 as part of

the annual Limerick City and County Council budgetary process.

Members welcomed the Motion. They commended the ICO for the work they were

carrying out and queried if funding could be made available.

In response, the Director of Regeneration, Sports and Recreation outlined the support

that had been given through the Regeneration Directorate and agreed to engage further with

the ICO to see what other level of support could be looked at. He pointed out that it is an

important programme for schools.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call for Government***

***intervention to start the process of upgrading Newcastle West Sewerage Scheme***

***immediately; to also put interim/temporary measures in place so that development can***

***continue while the upgrade can take place.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ruddle and seconded by Councillor Galvin.

In moving the Motion, Councillor Ruddle outlined the lack of capacity in the

wastewater plant in the Newcastle West area which was affecting further growth and

development of Newcastle West town.

Members expressed concern at the lack of capacity in the plant and emphasised the

need for an immediate solution. They highlighted the number of planning permissions that

could not progress due to the lack of capacity and urged the Council to engage with Uisce

Éireann and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

The Mayor referred to the inadequacy of the infrastructure for Limerick and informed

the Members that this issue was discussed at his recent meeting with the Taoiseach,

requesting the Government to expedite the plan to upgrade Newcastle West.

In response to Members’ concerns, the Director of Planning and Place-Making pointed

out that a solution would take some time to put in place and noted the next stage was to

consider the implementation of a temporary treatment plant, highlighting that it was

important to keep it as a priority. In the meantime, a meeting with Uisce Éireann had been

organised to look at possible solutions. He referred to a scheme that had been implemented

as a temporary measure by other local authorities and noted it as a possible solution for

Limerick.
---
25

The Members thanked the Director for his response and expressed their satisfaction

at a possible temporary solution, and asked to be kept up to date on progress.

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council calls on the Department of Education to***

***fund all safety measures that are necessary outside all Schools in the interest of children's***

***safety, particularly national schools, i.e. crossings, lighting, speed ramps, signage, car/bus***

***parking.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Collins (M).

In moving the Motion, Councillor Galvin stressed the need for safety measures around

more schools as the safety of children must be a priority.

Members welcomed the Motion and agreed that the Council should call on the

Department of Education for funding.

NOTICES OF MOTION IN RELATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLAN:

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir, the following Notices of Motion -

Nos. 24, 27 and 33 - in relation to the Development Plan - were taken together:

24.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Mayor of Limerick immediately commence a review***

***of the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 to expedite the development of housing in***

***Limerick City and County.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Keary.

In moving the Motion, Councillor Sheahan outlined the need to expedite a review of

the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028, emphasising the immediate need for housing and

noting that the housing targets had not been met to date. He referred to the new Planning

and Development Act, which had now been enacted, and queried if the Council’s

Development Plan was aligned with the current legislation. He referred to current zoned land

and stressed the need for more residential zoning throughout Limerick city and county.

27.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council amend the Limerick***

***Development Plan 2022-2028 to include the following:*** ***‘For a positive planning application***

***for a one-off rural house outside a settlement, that the absence of affordable dwellings for***

***purchase within a settlement be included as qualifying criteria where a housing need is***

***demonstrated.’***
---
26

The Motion was proposed by Councillor B. Collins and seconded by Councillor M.

Collins.

In moving the Motion, Councillor B. Collins outlined that somebody born and reared

in a Tier 4 settlement was precluded from getting permission to build outside the settlement.

She emphasised the need for affordable schemes to be delivered within the settlement but,

if they did not exist, she noted that persons should be allowed to build outside the settlement

if a site was available.

33.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

***I will move at the March Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the Forward***

***Planning Section of this Authority immediately commence a review of the current Limerick***

***Development Plan 2022-2028 with a view to amending Planning Policies and a review of***

***the current list of Protected Structures.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Keary and seconded by Councillor O’Donovan.

In moving the Motion, Councillor Keary welcomed the other two Motions and agreed

that a review of the Limerick Development Plan was required.

**REPLY to Notice of Motion No. 24** **–** **Councillor John Sheahan**

In accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), work on

the preparation of a new Development Plan must commence no later than four years

after the adoption of the previous Development Plan. Therefore, the statutory

process for the next Development Plan will commence in Q2 2026 and be completed

within two years thereafter. The Section 28, Development Plan Guidelines for

Planning Authorities, recommend that the preparatory work begins at least one year

prior to the formal commencement of the Plan review. This work will begin in Q2 2025

resulting in non-statutory work commencing imminently.

This preparatory phase encompasses significant workloads, including for example the

surveying of all settlements, the gathering and analysis of data and cross-sector

engagement, the drafting of the Baseline Report, Issues Papers and working papers

for the Core Strategy and all chapters of the Written Statement, Housing Strategy,

Retail Strategy, Economic Strategy, Building Heights Strategy, the carrying out of the

review of the Record of Protected Structures and the drafting of Strategic Flood Risk

Assessments and scoping of Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate

Assessment.

**REPLY to Notice of Motion No. 27** **–** **Councillor B. Collins**

In accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), the

Development Plan must be materially consistent with the policies and objectives of

the National Planning Framework and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy for

the Southern Region, the Plan must also be in accordance with National Planning
---
27

Policy Guidance issued by the Government. The amendment proposed is not in

accordance with the rural housing policies and objectives of the National Planning,

Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy, or any Section 28 Planning Guidance and

would therefore be contrary to Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000

(as amended).

**REPLY to Notice of Motion No. 33** **–** **Councillor S. Keary**

In accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended),

work on the preparation of a new Development Plan must commence no later than

four years after the adoption of the previous Development Plan. Therefore, the

statutory process for the next Development Plan will commence in Q2 2026 and be

completed within two years thereafter. The Section 28, Development Plan Guidelines

for Planning Authorities, recommend that the preparatory work begins at least one

year prior to the formal commencement of the Plan review. This work will begin in

Q2 2025 resulting in non-statutory work commencing imminently.

This preparatory phase encompasses significant workloads, including for example the

surveying of all settlements, the gathering and analysis of data and cross-sector

engagement, the drafting of the Baseline Report, Issues Papers and working papers

for the Core Strategy and all chapters of the Written Statement, Housing Strategy,

Retail Strategy, Economic Strategy, Building Heights Strategy, the carrying out of the

review of the Record of Protected Structures and the drafting of Strategic Flood Risk

Assessments and scoping of Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate

Assessment.

Members welcomed the Motions and agreed that a review of Limerick Development

Plan 2022-2028 was required. Members queried the process around initiating a review,

requested clarity on the number of Members required to approve a variation to a

Development Plan and asked if the Mayor can commence a review.

In response to the queries raised by the Members, the Director of Planning and Place-

Making informed the meeting that the Council are beginning the review process, which will

include background research work as preparatory work for the new Development Plan, which

would take 9 months. This process must be completed to enable commencement of the

statutory work on the new Limerick Development Plan within the required statutory

timeframe. He advised that the Council will need new housing figures from the Department

before the formal process can commence.

The Senior Planner, Forward Planning and Public Realm, advised the Members that

the statutory process for the development plan takes 2 years and it is proposed that this will

commence in quarter 1 next year. However, the background preparatory work will commence

this year.

The Director of Planning and Place-Making advised that the commencement of a

variation to the Limerick Development Plan is an executive function. However, under Section

13 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) the Members of a Planning
---
28

Authority may at any time, for stated reasons, submit a resolution to the Mayor of the

Planning Authority, requesting him to prepare a report on a proposal by them to initiate a

process to consider the variation of the Development Plan where three-quarters of the

Members of the Authority have approved such resolution. The Mayor in response shall then

submit a report to the Members within 4 weeks.

Councillor Teskey referred to his recent Motion in relation to wind farms and

requested the Mayor to meet with the residents of Coolcappa to discuss the matter. In

response, the Mayor agreed to meet with the residents of Coolcappa.

The Executive agreed to organise a workshop with the Members to discuss the subject

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council process rent***

***assessments for people in Council properties in a timely manner to avoid tenants receiving***

***backdated bills for arrears.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery and seconded by Councillor Kiely.

**REPLY:**

The Rents Department of the Housing Directorate currently has responsibility

for 5,847 tenanted houses, which generated an income of €20.6m for 2024.

The Standard Letting agreement stipulates that it is the responsibility of the

tenant to immediately inform the Council of any changes to household

composition and/or to their income, as soon as any change occurs. This is

emphasised to tenants when they are i) allocated a house and ii) as part of the

quarterly rent statement process

However, not all tenants comply fully with this provision which can lead to

untimely delays and historic arrears accumulating.

In late 2023, the Rents Unit commenced a global rent review in trying to

update household composition and income details for all tenancies, to ensure

all households are dealt with on an equitable basis. In the majority of cases,

where all necessary documentation was submitted etc. a timely response was

forthcoming in terms of any changes accruing to amount of rent payable.

However, in instances where necessary supporting documentation was not

submitted, it was often the case that the Rents Unit had to pursue same

through letters, phone calls etc. and, in some cases, this could be a lengthy

process.

At this stage the vast majority of forms have been fully assessed and the new

rent has been notified to the tenant, including arrears and refunds of

overpayments if applicable. If any member wishes to raise any particular case,

with the consent of the tenant, the individual circumstances of the case can be

reviewed with the relevant Revenue Collector and Administrative Officer with

responsibility for the Rents Department.

Aside from the global rent review the Rents Department continually processes

tenant led rent assessments on an ongoing basis. All tenant led rent

assessments are processed without delay.

Following the completion of the global rent review, the Rents Department

will review its policies, processes and procedures in relation to future global

rent reviews in order to maximise efficiencies. The Rents Department is also

exploring the digitalisation of work processes including the global rent

review, in order to allow the tenant complete rent updates in an on-line

format; this should also provide further efficiencies.

In reply to concerns raised, the Director of Housing agreed to review the internal

process for the rent assessments.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Beasley

***I will move at the next Meeting that a space be gifted by Limerick City and County Council***

***for Limerick Lace to have a location where they can showcase their wares for tourists and***

***interested parties.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Beasley and seconded by Councillor Hickey-

O’Mara.

**REPLY:**

Limerick Museum holds the largest known collection of Limerick Lace in

existence. This includes the Florence Vere O’Brien Collection, the Maude

Kearney Collection and a significant collection of lace from the Presentation

Convent. The Museum also holds a comprehensive collection of lace patterns

from the above collections. It includes medals and awards won by Limerick

Lace over the years, including the 1851 medal from the Great Exhibition at

Crystal Palace London.

A substantial part of the Lace Collection is on permanent display in the

Museum and it is rotated on a regular basis to afford access to all, including

tourists and interested parties. Limerick Lace is a key element in the Museum

offer and the Museum highlights different aspects of the collection in its

annual exhibitions; for example, in August 2025, an exhibition showing a cross-

section of the collection, with additional modern pieces from present-day lace

makers, will be on display.

Limerick Lace is a fragile, unique and valuable collection which needs specialist

care, provided by the curatorial staff of Limerick Museum. A separate location

would require a considerable capital and revenue budget and a staffing

resource to provide a similar offer. It is therefore considered that Limerick

Museum affords the most appropriate and accessible location to showcase

Limerick Lace to all.

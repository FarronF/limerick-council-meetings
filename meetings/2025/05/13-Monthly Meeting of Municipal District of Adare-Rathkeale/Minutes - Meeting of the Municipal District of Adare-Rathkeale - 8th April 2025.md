**QUESTIONS**

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next Meeting does this Local Authority carry out independent noise**

**monitoring in areas in which wind farms exist, if so how often do these take place and**

**what repercussions are to be imposed on such a development if noise levels are**

**recorded as unsatisfactory.**

**REPLY:**

The Council does undertake noise monitoring where complaints are

received with respect to noise from wind farms. Since 2008 the Council has

investigated noise complaints regarding five wind farms in County Limerick.

The Council assesses wind turbine noise levels against relevant conditions

granted under planning, best practice and guidance where available. Where

wind farm noise is considered to be unsatisfactory the Council has a variety

of enforcement actions it can take under the Planning and Development

Act (2000 as amended) and Environmental Protection Agency Act (1992 as

amended), or in the most severe cases an application to the Courts for an

injunction. In all cases the Council will attempt to engage with complainants

and operators to find a satisfactory solution to a complaint.

**I will ask at the next Meeting what are the official speed limits now on the N21**

**who and who authorised such change.**

**REPLY:**

The Road Traffic Act 2004 introduced the provision for a County or City

Manager (now CE) to apply, by order, a Special Speed Limit in respect of

Road Works ( Road Works Speed Limit Order).

Temporary Works Speed Limits have been introduced on the N21 at

Smithfield, Croagh and at Gortaganniff, Adare following consultation with

An Garda Siochana and with TII. Temporary Speed limits have also been

introduced on Kildimo L1423 and Askeaton L1422 roads out of Adare.

These temporary speed limits are to facilitate the construction of new

roundabouts on the N21 as part of the Foynes to Limerick road- Adare

Bypass and associated site traffic entering /exiting the site. Similarly, the

temporary Speed Limits on the Kildimo and Askeaton roads out of Adare

are to facilitate works interfacing with local roads.

Specifically with respect to Croagh- heading in the direction of Adare from

Croagh, the existing 60km/hr zone is extended eastwards.

The 60km/hr zone is then reduced to 50km/hr zone until past the proposed

works area where the 50km/hr steps up to a 60km/hr zone and from then

up to a 100km/hr zone.

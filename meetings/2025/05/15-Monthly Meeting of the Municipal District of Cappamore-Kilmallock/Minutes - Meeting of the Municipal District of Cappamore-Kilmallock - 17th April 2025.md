to the Meeting. The City and County Librarian proceeded to give a PowerPoint presentation
to the Elected Members to update them on the 2025 National Famine Commemoration

is located within the historic Kilmallock Union Workhouse complex. The ceremony will be
attended by President Michael D. Higgins; Patrick O’Donovan, Minister for Arts, Culture,
Communications, Media and Sport; John Moran, Mayor of Limerick, along with other
dignitaries and invited guests.

He confirmed that it was the first time the State Commemoration has taken place in County

would provide an opportunity for the people of Co. Limerick and the surrounding counties
to honour the memory of those who perished or emigrated as a result of An Gorta Mor.

agreed that it was a significant honour for the District, and Limerick, that the ceremony

invited to the ceremony, so as to facilitate as many as possible in attending.

The City and County Librarian confirmed that the event was being co-ordinated between

national ceremony, that the number of invitations would be likely restricted to the capacity
and seating in the Famine Memorial Park, along with the requirements of the various

Notice of Motions

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

| will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that

Limerick City & County Council would roll out the use of CCTV cameras, or any other
initiatives in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District, to work on combating the
blight on our District of the illegal dumping of roadside rubbish.

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Cllr M. Ryan, seconded by Cllr Carey, and agreed.
REPLY:

In 2024, the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) published 2 Code of
Practice for Local Authorities for the use of CCTV in Litter and Waste Enforcement under
the Circular Economy Act 2022. It allows local authorities to install CCTV and process the
data for enforcement, where It is proportionate to do so. The Code sets out a detailed


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

process, which must be followed in order to install CCTV schemes lawfully for this
purpose. It includes;

¢ The preparation of a Business Case that demonstrates the necessity and
proportionality of each scheme and includes evidence of a specific operational
problem, e.g. inspections, enforcements, fines, clean-up costs;
The preparation of Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for each scheme;
The presentation of the DPIA to the LCCC CCTV Oversight Board for consideration;
Director General approval for each scheme.

CCTV can only be deployed for specific operational tasks in designated locations and not
used for general patrol/surveillance. i.e., CCTV Schemes are not to be used to routinely
monitor the movements of members of the public.

To date three schemes have been approved: Bring Banks (six sites), Litter Black Spots (3
sites), Dual Purpose Cameras (Regeneration 12 sites). A further three Bring Banks have
been recommended with more Dual Purpose cameras also in process.

Where there are specific sites in the Cappamore — Kilmallock Municipal District where
there is evidence of a persistent problem and that the installation of CCTV would be
considered proportionate, a business case can be drafted and brought to the CCTV
Oversite Committee. Proposals for CCTV should be sent to the Domestic Waste and
Litter team through a Dynamics case for investigation.

10.Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr Stokes

| will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that
consideration be given to the implementation of traffic calming measures at R513
Kilfrush Co, Limerick located near the entrance/exit along the stretch of road in front of
Hospital Tennis Club.

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Cllr Stokes, seconded by Cllr Conway, and
agreed.

REPLY:

This area is located within an existing speed limit and traffic calming measures, in the
form of a driver feedback sign, are currently in place. The Roads Engineer will measure
the current speed of traffic and determine if additional measures are warranted. In the
interim, the Roads Engineer will also liaise with An Garda Siochana, requesting that
increased enforcement of the existing speed limit is carried out.

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr Conway

| will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that a
traffic management survey be carried out on Sarsfield Street, Kilmallock with a view to
placing a pedestrian crossing near Friars Gate.

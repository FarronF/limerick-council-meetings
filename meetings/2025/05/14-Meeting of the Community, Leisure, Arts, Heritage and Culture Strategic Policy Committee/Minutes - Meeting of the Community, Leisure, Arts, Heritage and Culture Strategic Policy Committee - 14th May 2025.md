Item 1: Introductions/ Role and Responsibilities of SPC

This was the first meeting for the Community, Leisure, Arts, Heritage and Culture
Strategic Policy Committee.

The Chairperson Cllr Fergus Kilcoyne welcomed the members and officials and invited all
to introduce themselves. A round of introductions took place.

Director of Service Stephane Duclot gave a presentation regarding the roles and
responsibilities of Strategic Policy Committee (SPC).

The members were advised that SPC is set up to last for the lifetime of the elected council
and that one third of the membership should be from sector relevant to the committee
works. Currently CLAHC SPC consist 16 elected members and 6 sectoral representatives,
however four vacancies are to be filled by PPN election, bringing that number to 10.
Quorum to hold the meeting is formed by minimum one quarter of the approved
membership plus one.

The SPC Scheme for 2024-2029 was adopted in November 2024. In accordance with
guidelines meetings should be held at least four times a year and calendar of the
meetings should be agreed. SPC should have annual work program that should be linked
to local authority plans and should consider climate as a cross-cutting issue in their work
programmes.

SPC Chair should hold office for a minimum of three years which could be renewed by
the Council. Decisions are typically made by consensus, but voting can occur if necessary
and the chairperson has a casting vote in the event of a tie.

The Council is and remains the decision-making Authority and it is the task of the SPCs,
as committees of the Council, to advise and assist the Council in the formulation,
development and review of policy. The remit of the SPCs is to deal only with policy
matters and as such they are strategic in nature and have no remit in relation to routine
operational matters regarding the delivery of services. The SPC system is intended to
give Councillors and relevant Sectoral Interests an opportunity for full involvement in the
policy making process from the early stages.

By invitation from S. Duclot each section under Community, Leisure, Arts, Heritage and
Culture SPC remit gave a brief overview of their work.

Item 2: World Health Organisation — Healthy Cities Application- for Consideration for
recommendation to the Full Council

A presentation was made by Olivia O'Brien, Healthy Limerick Co-ordinator, giving the
members overview and context of WHO Healthy Cities Application.

The members were advised that The Healthy Cities Network, initiated by the WHO in
1987, emphasises the critical role of local governments in health and sustainable
development. The programme has grown to include National Networks in 20 countries
within the WHO European Region, connecting over 1,800 cities, counties, and towns.

The approach seeks to put health high on the political and social agenda of cities and to
build a strong movement for community led, evidence based health and wellbeing at the
local government level. It strongly emphasizes equity, participatory governance and
solidarity, intersectoral collaboration and action to address the determinants of health.
Successful implementation of this approach requires innovative action addressing all
aspects of health and living conditions. The approach recognises the determinants of
health (where people live, grow, play, learn, and work) and the need to work in
collaboration across public, private, voluntary and community sector organisations, This
way of working and thinking includes involving local people in decision-making, requires
political commitment and organizational and community development, and recognises
the process to be as important as the outcomes.

The Lead for the European Healthy Cities Network visited Limerick last September.
Afterwards an official request (EO!) was submitted to the WHO, and Limerick was invited
to apply for WHO accreditation. Drafted application was sent to members in advance of
this meeting. It is hoped that Community, Leisure, Arts, Heritage and Culture SPC will
recommend the application for consideration to Full Council on March 31st. If approved
application will be submitted to the Irish National Healthy Cities and Counties Network
meeting on April 1st for onward submission to the WHO.

Joining the network will provide broader opportunities for collaboration and visibility
internationally. It will also provide international recognition as a healthy city, making
Limerick a more attractive place to live and visit. Limerick's vision is to become a
healthier, more equitable, and sustainable city and county by addressing health

inequalities, enhancing community participation, and designing spaces that promote

“provide ambitious leadership and strive to deliver an innovative, vibrant, safe and
inclusive Limerick for everyone” and its stretches well beyond the boundaries of
Limerick. The main reason for creation of the site it to enable sharing of digital collections
with the public.

The previous site, established in the early 2000s was outdated and due to its technical
limitation could not be developed further. The aim was to create new site that would
have intuitive navigation, responsive design, engaging content and work well on any
screen size. Site that would reflect reach content and provide easy navigation, reflecting
the rich tapestry and content of the local studies collection, Dual purpose of the site
makes content sharing accessible for casual users interested in local studies and local
history but also researchers who appreciate access to primary material and massive
quantity of data.

Site proves to be popular not only in Ireland but also with diaspora nations with
obituaries being one of the most visited pages. User engagement statistics show how
important it was to make site friendly to access from other devices showing 49% users
accessing from mobile/ tablet.

Vast collection of materials can be found on the site including:
@ Decade of Centenaries -council publications, exhibitions, journals, films
recordings etc.
e Articles- aims to connect into the heritage history community and become a hub
of that community also invites submission of articles.

The main goal of the Plan will be to improve participation in sport and physical activity,
increase collaboration with sporting bodies and to assist key stakeholders, including the
Council and the Limerick Sports Partnership to leverage funding in the future for
enhanced sport and physical activities. In 2023, adult participation levels in sports was 43%,
and the objective is to get it to greater than 60% by 2027.

The initial phase was the launch of Get Ireland Active, an interactive database mapping
geographical areas for physical activity. Consultations were established through the City
and County Managers Association (CCMA). Four local authorities were selected for the
pilot: Carlow, Cavan, Clare, and Laois and national steering group was established,
comprising members from Sport Ireland, the Department of Sport, and all four local
authorities.

Funding has been received from Sport Ireland to procure a consultant. The request for
tender is out, and assessment is expected by the end of March. Following the
consultant's appointment, engagement with stakeholders will begin using My Point
platform but also with residents, community groups, and national governing bodies.
The process includes facilitated workshops to put consultation findings where key
actions and visions are set out. There will be development of a strategic framework
where focused interviews will be conducted to refine the emerging draft.
A final strategic framework will be developed, with a draft for consideration at the July
SPC for consideration for recommendation to full council. The aim is to have approval
from the full council and launch the plan in October 2025.

Item 5: Date of next meeting
The Chairperson Cllr Fergus Kilcoyne thanked all for the presentations made. The next
meeting of the Community, Leisure, Arts, Heritage and Culture SPC will take place on

Wednesday 14'* May 2025 in Council Chamber, Dooradoyle at 3pm and online. Dates of
the future meetings will be circulated to members.

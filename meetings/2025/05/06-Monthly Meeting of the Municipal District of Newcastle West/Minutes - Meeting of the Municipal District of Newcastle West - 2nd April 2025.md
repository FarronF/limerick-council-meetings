Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

REPLY:

To recap, Limerick City and County Council received correspondence from Uisce Éireann

outlining connection feasibility in November 2020. Following receipt of the Part 8 approval,

correspondence was issued to Uisce Éireann to regenerate the Connection and Development

Service offer and establish connection (May 2024). A number of emails were issued to Uisce

Éireann and as Limerick City and County Council were not receiving positive feedback,

Limerick City and County Council requested that the LGMA get involved. In July 2024, a

number of minor Uisce Éireann queries in relation to the connection were answered by

Limerick City and County Council. A number of emails were issued by Limerick City and County

Council to Uisce Éireann requesting an update between July and October 2024 without

response. Limerick City and County Council were contacted by the LGMA in December 2024

stating that a decision was about to be made and it would be a positive outcome, however,

some changes were required which would be designed out. No decision was received.

Following an online meeting with Uisce Éireann on 26th February 2025, we were advised by

Uisce Éireann that a decision was imminent, however it did not appear positive. On 26th

February 2025, Limerick City and County Council received correspondence from Uisce Éireann

stating that a connection could not be progressed as capacity was unavailable. Uisce Éireann

further stated that capital works are planned but are several years away. Therefore, the

proposed Sycamore Crescent housing development is now on hold until Uisce Éireann provide

a connection.

Councillor Scanlan expressed dissatisfaction at the response received and that the

development of housing is being held up in the District due to insufficient capacity in the

treatment plant.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to the
Meeting and the Questions were therefore taken as having been dealt with.

5. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed update on the bypasses of (a) Adare, (b)
Abbeyfeale and (c) Newcastle West. Please give potential time frames, costings to date,
next steps for each bypass and potential issues that may arise.

REPLY:

(a)

(b), (c)

The Adare Bypass is one element of the Foynes to Limerick Road project which is
a 35km road connecting Limerick city to the port of Foynes. The overall project is
seen as vital for the strategic development and expansion of Shannon Foynes Port,
for West Limerick and the Mid-West Region in general.

November 2023 marked the commencement of several enabling works contracts
which are currently being progressed along the entire length of the project. These
include for hedge clearance, fencing, an archaeological resolution contract, the
construction of three railway bridges, haul road construction in addition to the
diversion of numerous utility services.

On the 16 December, 2024, Limerick City and County Council announced that the
joint venture of John Sisk & Son (Holdings) Ltd and Sorensen Civil Engineering Ltd.,
known as Sisk Sorensen Joint Venture had been awarded the Adare Bypass Design
and Construction Contract, between the proposed Adare and Croagh junctions.
Works are scheduled to commence on site in January 2025.

There has been approximately €67 million spent to date on the project since it
commenced in 2014. A substantial portion on that is in recent times, due to the
commencement of the construction phase, land acquisition, archaeological works,
bridge contracts etc. While the Contract duration is 30 months, with a scheduled
contract end date of June 2027, there still remains a number of challenges for the
project team to achieve this very ambitious target.

The Council is continuing to progress the remaining elements of the overall project
through this construction phase.

Since our update to you on the N21 Abbeyfeale and N21 Newcastle West schemes,
for the November Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West we have
continued through Phase 3 of Til’s Project Management Guidelines which includes
design and preparation of statutory documents.

The design and environmental evaluation are substantially progressed to
incorporate additional design requirements including consideration of the active

travel facility cross section, the impacts of the 2023 speed limit review and the
results from additional environmental surveys and we have also carried out
additional archaeological test excavations at various locations.

We are on target to publish further design update early in 2025 and this update
will show the proposed mainline, side road realignments and junction designs as
well as whether the road is in cut or on fill. In addition, proposed access
arrangements, material deposition areas, watercourse diversions and the location
of drainage ponds etc., will be shown. As part of this update we will provide
timeline estimates for the progression of the N21 Abbeyfeale and N21 Newcastle
West schemes. Following the design update the project team will engage with
affected landowners in a series of one-to-one meetings to discuss the scheme
design within the lands affected.

Prior to submitting a planning application to An Bérd Pleandla both projects will
be subject to peer review by Til and the Department of Transport and a legal
review of the Environmental Impact Assessment documents. The outcome of
these approval processes can potentially result in programme delays.

The progression of the schemes is subject to the continued support of public
funding for the projects.

There has been approximately €1.9M and €1.8M spent to date on the Newcastle
West and Abbeyfeale Bypass schemes respectively.

6. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed update on (a) Devon Road Cross and (b) Dore’s
Cross, Templeglantine.

REPLY:

(a) In 2023, the Mid West National Road Design Office resubmitted a feasibility report to
Til recommending a staggered junction be constructed at N21 Devon Cross, to replace
the existing arrangement. Unfortunately Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TIl) refused
approval to proceed with the detail design process and preparation of tender
documents and they did not allocate the necessary funding to implement the
recommended staggered junction at Devon Cross.

(b) To date, Limerick City and County Council have been unsuccessful in securing funding
for this scheme. We are carrying out additional surveys to further support our
application and will resubmit to TIl for consideration.

Limerick City and County Council will continue to follow up on this scheme and provide
an update once available.

NOTICES OF MOTION

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council expedite the Flood Relief Scheme in
Athea particularly after recent floods nearly causing flooding in the village.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.
REPLY:
The preferred option for the Athea Flood Relief Scheme (FRS) has been identified and

environmental assessments are currently being reviewed by Limerick City and County Council
and finalised. The cost benefit of the scheme is proving challenging to achieve a value of 1 or


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
greater (i.e. where benefits exceed the proposed project cost of the FRS) and further work is
underway to maximise the benefits of the scheme whilst also refining the proposed capital
cost of the scheme.

Subject to achieving a positive outcome on the cost benefit assessment, Limerick City and
County Council will seek approval from OPW to submit the FRS to An Bord Pleandla for
planning consent under Section 175 and Section 177AE of the Planning and Development Act,
2000 at the earliest opportunity which is currently programmed for Q2, 2025.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that the Athea Flood Relief Scheme be
expedited and that temporary works be carried out in the meantime including dredging and
the clearing of debris from under the bridge. In replying, the Director stated that the Athea
Flood Relief Scheme is being finalised at present and following the approval of the Office of
Public Works, it is envisaged that this scheme will be submitted to An Bord Pleanala for
consideration in Q2 2025. It was agreed that a further update would be given to the Members
on the provision of temporary dredging works at the bridge in the meantime.

Dissatisfaction was expressed at the length of time taken to progress this scheme and in
replying the Director referred to the complexity of the scheme, the large amount of flood
relief schemes in the country and to the limited expertise in this area.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

1 will move at the next Meeting that the Council calls on the Department of the Office of
Public Works to draw up a Flood Relief Scheme from the Mart Bridge towards the rear of
Abbey United Soccer Club and that this includes the dredging of the river from the said
locations.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.
REPLY:

Following a review of the CFRAM study, which evaluated flood risk management options
nationwide, the only viable measures identified for Abbeyfeale were the baseline Measure
“Do Nothing” and the Non-Structural Measure “Public Awareness”. However, neither of these
measures were considered viable in providing the required 1%AEP event design standard of
flood protection. As part of our commitment to addressing flood risk, Limerick City and County
Council will engage with the Office of Public Works (OPW) to explore whether a reassessment
of the area can be undertaken, taking into account any recent data, developments, or
emerging risks.

Further to the above, it is important to note that due to the presence of the River Feale SAC,
dredging is unlikely to be viable due to concerns with regard to the long-term sustainability
and effectiveness in flood risk reduction of this measure in addition to the likely potential for
significant negative impacts on the SAC and surrounding environment.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to the substantial damage caused by the

extreme flooding event which took place recently in Abbeyfeale and to the damage caused
to Abbeyfeale United FC and Fr. Casey's GAA grounds and facilities. In replying, the Director
stated that Tranche 1 schemes for Limerick has been approved by the Office of Public Works
and that Tranche 2 schemes which includes Abbeyfeale is awaiting approval from the Office
of Public Works.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the District would write to the Minister of State at
the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with responsibility for the Office
of Public Works to advance a Flood Relief Scheme for Abbeyfeale.

14, () subm by Councillor J. n

| will move at the next Meeting that both lighting and shelter be improved at the
Westbound Bus Stop fronting the Longcourt House Hotel.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY: We will ask the National Transport Authority if the existing westbound bus
shelter fronting the Longcourt House Hotel can be upgraded. If this request is
approved, this location will be added to the 2025 Bus Shelter Enabling Works
Grant Application.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that the Westbound Bus Stop is extremely
exposed and requested that an upgrade of the bus shelter take place. Councillor Scanlan also
made reference to the provision of additional bus stops along the route.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will move at the next Meeting that the road lighting at Killoughteen school be adjusted
and placed on a timer to limit its levels of glare and intrusiveness on neighbouring
residential properties.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY: This issue has been highlighted in the past and an investigation whether we
could dim the lights, it was found that any effort to dim the light would
compromise the safety of pedestrians crossing the road at night.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the glare from the lighting affecting
houses in the vicinity of Killoughteen school and if a timer could be installed on the lights. A
brief discussion followed and in replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the
dimming of lights would compromise the safety of pedestrians at night but however agreed
to seek clarification on putting the lights on a timer.

The following items were also raised.


---

An update was sought on a clean-up and surveying of trees at Oakpark estate, Newcastle
West. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer agreed to revert to the Members on this
matter.

Reference was made to a stream which is clogged up with stones in Ballagh next to where the
Post Office was previously located. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that he
would contact the Office of Public Works to see if it will qualify for the Minor Works Scheme.

An update was sought on the proposed installation of a bollard at the top of Nash's Lane,
Newcastle West, to prevent traffic entering Nash’s Lane from the Square, Newcastle West. In
replying, the Senior Executive Engineer agreed to provide an update prior to the next
Meeting.

A request was made for the glass on the recently vandalised bus shelter across from the
Devon Hotel to be replaced and in replying, the Executive Engineer agreed to follow up on
this matter with Central Services.

Reference was made to St. Ita’s Day in Killeedy which takes place on the 15" January every
year and a Happy St. Ita’s Day was wished to all.

The issue of public lighting was raised and reference was made to various street lights not
working in the District. Following a brief discussion, it was agreed that the Members would
submit a list of street lights of concern to the Meetings Administrator who would then
forward this list to Central Services.

The Meetings Administrator referred to the holding of a Workshop on Limerick City and
County Council's Corporate Plan 2024 — 2029 and it was agreed by all that this Workshop
would take place on Wednesday, 29* January, 2025, at 10 a.m., at Aras William Smith OBrien.

**the regulations on the newest application forms for Housing Adaptation Grants for**

**older people and disabled people. Most notably the unavailability of a grant to**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Teskey

and agreed to forward for inclusion on the Agenda for the next Full Council Meeting.

In proposing the Motion Councillor O’Donoghue stated older house stock units are not

suitable for air to water installation and there will be huge cost burdens on home

owners as well as the Local Authority when they retrofit their social housing stock. He

further added following the recent electricity outages due to adverse weather

conditions these properties would not have heating or cooking facilities with air to water

installation. Councillor Teskey added there also is an extra burden on people with

medial conditions who are reliant on electricity and added the Housing Adaptation Grant

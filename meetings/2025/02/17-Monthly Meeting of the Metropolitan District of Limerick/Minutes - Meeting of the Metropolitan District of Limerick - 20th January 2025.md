***Hierarchy Map for the Metropolitan District of Limerick in place, and if not, when does the Council***

***anticipate generating such a map.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council is in discussions with the Roads Management Office (RMO)

regarding the creation of online mapping which would provide this information. The RMO

are exploring options for a national database which would be available to the public. We

are awaiting clarification from the RMO regarding confirmation that this service will

proceed and the timelines associated.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor P. Doyle**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick**when will the Greenway***

***path from the University of Limerick / Plassey be extended to reach Castleconnell**and Montpelier***

***and will there be a path linking the new planned Park and Ride parking facility at the Mackey***

***Roundabout with this Greenway**so that UL staff and students could cycle into work and study***

***after parking their cars at the Mackey Roundabout**facility.***

**REPLY:** The UL to Montpelier Greenway project is currently nearing the end of the route selection

process to identify an emerging preferred route. A number of key criteria are being used to

identify the route and these are being assessed in accordance with TII guidelines and

procedures. It is the intention to finalise identification of an emerging preferred route in

the early part of this year, after which key project deliverables can be completed and TII

approval sought to progress to Public Consultation. The proposed Park & Ride facility

planned for the Mackey Roundabout is known and being considered by the design team,

and connectivity between both facilities can be considered following the identification of

the preferred route of the greenway project.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what is the current update***

***with Our Lady Queen of Peace Community Centre.*** ***I am aware the Council have received funds***

**REPLY**: The Council has received provisional funding approval in relation to a refurbishment plan

for the Centre. The acquisition of the property has not been agreed but the Council will

continue to engage with the Diocese in relation to this matter.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick is there an update on The***

***Factory Youthspace Galvone in relation to them staying in the premises until a suitable location***

***is found.***

**REPLY**: Discussions have been ongoing in relation to extending the current arrangement with the

**9.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***decluttering of unnecessary street signage including the former car park signs which have not***

***been in use for several years.***

**REPLY**: 49 signs were removed as part of the de-cluttering element of the Wayfinding & Orientation

Signage Project and the pavement surface was reinstated.

Although the digital car park signage is not currently operational, there is potential for the

remaining infrastructure to be refurbished or repurposed in future to support objectives of

the new Limerick City Centre Transport Plan, subject to available funding for such a project.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the Council to clarify the***

***criteria for corporate sponsorship of city roundabouts given the significant differences in the***

***quality and maintenance of the roundabouts.***

**REPLY:** The criteria for roundabout sponsorship requires the Sponsor to enter into a three year

Service Level Agreement, where the roundabout must be maintained to an acceptable

standard. In return, the Roundabout Sponsorship Scheme allows the Sponsor to erect

signage on the roundabout to advertise their business for this three year period. The

Sponsorship can be extended for a further three year period but this is subject to the mutual

agreement of both parties.

In situations where a roundabout is not maintained to a satisfactory standard, the

sponsorship will not be extended by a further three year period and the Sponsor is required

to remove their signage. This allows for this roundabout to be included on the annual list

for seeking Expressions of Interest for future roundabout sponsorship.

effective on a phased basis over the next 2 years.

As part of BusConnects, work will commence on Sustainable Transport Corridors which will

**17.Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what portion of the 8 acre***

***Cleeves Site will be occupied by TUS. Is there any other community/cultural/residential plans for***

***the site.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick Twenty Thirty prepared a Master Plan for the 10 acre Cleeves Riverside Quarter site

(Cleeves) in 2023. The Master Plan identified five development zones:

 Flaxmill site

 Quarry site

 Salesians site

 Stonetown site

 Shipyard site

These development zones provide for a variety of uses including residential, commercial and some

community/cultural uses. The indicative range of accommodation set-out in the Master Plan is as

follows:

 250-300 homes

 35,000m2 of commercial space.

 5,000-6,500 mixed use space.

*Figure 1-Cleeves Development Zones*

Since the Master Plan was completed in October 2023, Limerick Twenty Thirty have progressed

with Phase 1 that includes the residential accommodation, public realm and heritage buildings. The

Definitive Project Brief for Phase 1 was completed in Q1 2024 with the formal design stages

progressing since then. The scheme has evolved in line with ongoing market engagement and now

includes a Purpose Built Student Accommodation development of 271 beds. The Phase 1 designs

provide for the following accommodation:

 230 homes

 271 PBSA beds

 1,050m2 of cultural/community/mixed use space

A further development during 2024 was the decision by the Technological University of the

Shannon Midlands Midwest (TUS) to develop a new City Centre Campus at Cleeves. While still at a

very early stage of development, an Options Appraisal has been completed, and this identifies an

indicative range of floor space for a new Higher Education Campus of between 12,000 and 13,000

m2. The new University Campus will be developed at 3 locations that include some of the heritage

buildings and other new build elements. Please see indicative sketch below in Figure 2 with the

proposed locations of the new campus outlined in red. The area highlighted in blue will be retained

for publicly accessible uses such as community space, food and beverage offering etc. The Strategic

Brief for the TUS Campus also provides for publicly accessible areas such as an event space/music

venue. The scale and nature of the publicly accessible spaces will be developed further during the

design stages and further stakeholder engagement is undertaken.

*Figure 2-Indicative location of TUS CRQ Campus*

The commercial spaces, which have the potential to be offices, hotel, health care, etc. will be

progressed during a later phase of the development and will be subject to further engagement

with the market to explore the options for delivery. The extent of commercial space is currently in

the region of 26,000m2 and is located primarily on the Shipyard Site on the southern end of Cleeves

Riverside Quarter.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council provide an***

***update on water quality at the Corbally Baths.***

**REPLY:** In relation to water quality monitoring at Corbally Baths, Limerick City and County Council

undertakes sampling fortnightly during the bathing season (June 1st to 15th September) and

has done so since May 2019. The Bathing Water Regulations require four years of

microbiological testing in order to perform an indicative assessment of the water quality at

this location for bathing. Currently the water quality is of “poor” quality and therefore not

satisfying the limits set out in the Bathing Water Regulations. However, an improvement

in microbiological results was noted in 2024 compared to previous years.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council provides***

***an update on air quality across Limerick City North.***

**REPLY:**

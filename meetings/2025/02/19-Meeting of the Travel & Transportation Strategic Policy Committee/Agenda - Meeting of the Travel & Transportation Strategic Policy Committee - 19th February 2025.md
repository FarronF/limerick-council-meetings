**AGENDA**

**1.Minutes:**

To adopt the draft minutes of the Meeting of the Travel and Transportation Strategic

Policy Committee held on the 23rd April 2024.

**2.Presentation: Hedge cutting policy**

Two Notice of Motions (a) & (b) to be taken as part of Item 2

**a.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely (referred from September**

**Council Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting that this Local Authority examine the possibility

of a Community Hedge Cutting Grant

**b.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond** **(referred from September**

**Council Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would adopt

a policy of cutting Hedges/Trees between the months of September to March that

are a danger to all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles owners,

thus preventing serious accidents from occurring on all our roads.

**3.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue (referred from Adare-**

**Rathkeale September Municipal Meeting)**

I will move at the next meeting that a plan for verge trimming on a year round basis

be implemented by L.C.C.C on all roads under the control of the Local Authority.

**4.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Doyle (referred from September Metro**

**Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that free

parking for one hour be allowed for cars on street parking currently designated as

loading bays from 14.00 PM to 18.00 PM Monday to Friday on a trial basis for three

months. The objective of this measure is to encourage shoppers into Limerick City and

increase footfall in William Street and Cruises Street and surrounding areas. The only

cost to this measure is amending signage on the poles with appropriate stickers.

**5.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (referred from October Metro**

**Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this

Council amend our traffic calming policy to allow the delivery of traffic calming

measures where an elected member provides the funding and the necessary petition

is signed and submitted by residents.---

**6.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Doyle (referred from October Metro**

**Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick

City and County Council would present to city centre retailers at no cost parking

ticket books in January 2025 provided the retailers have paid their 2024 rates in

full. I would suggest large retailers who pay more than €20K in rates receive a 100

book of tickets and all other retailers 25 books of tickets to distribute free parking

tickets to their customers in Limerick City centre. A provision for such a scheme

should also be included in the Councils 2025 Budget process.

**7.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas (referred from October Metro**

**Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the

Mayor and the Director General liaise with UL and An Garda Síochána, to set up and

chair a taskforce to address car parking problems in residential areas around the

University of Limerick.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas (referred from September Council**

**Meeting)**

I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council will introduce in its

forthcoming budget a Community Hedge Cutting Grant Scheme to assist communities,

groups of local residents and landowners with the cutting of dangerous overhanging

hedges/tree branches along public roads, similar to the schemes provided by

Clare/Leitrim/Cork County Councils.

**9.Update on provision of salt to** **Resident’s Associations during extreme weather**

**conditions**

**10.Update on Bus Connects programme.**---

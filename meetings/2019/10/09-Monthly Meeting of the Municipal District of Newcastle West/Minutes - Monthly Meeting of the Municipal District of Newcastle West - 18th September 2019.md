a national road with a high collision rate. The site was reviewed further by Mid

West National Road Design Office. A feasibility report was prepared

recommending the installation of a right turn lane on the N21 and TII Approval

was granted for construction of the right turn lane. A ground investigation and

10.Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the issues raised by the Cryle View Residents***

***Association at a recent meeting of the District.***

REPLY:

There has been multiple meetings on site at Cryle View with regard to the issues raised

by the Cryle View Residents Association.

In relation to the entrance, a site survey has been completed and a preliminary design

has been prepared that increases the site lines from exiting the estate. The design

involves a build out on both sides of the junction with raised kerbs and this will

increase the width of the footpaths.

The stop line is to be moved out approx. 2.2m from its existing location. This will

achieve the required sight distance of 160m either side of the junction. The centre line

on the road is not being adjusted. The estimated overall cost is around €72K. The

feasibility report is being prepared at the moment and will be submitted to TII for

approval in the coming weeks.

A design has been prepared by the Newcastle West office for the green area on the

right hand side as you exit the estate but this is dependent on agreement with

neighbouring landowners.

Irish Water and the Council’s Water Services Department are carrying out

investigations on the waste water system at the estate and in the interim the

manholes have been cleaned out.

There will also be an upgrade of the storm water network in the general area of the

exit roadway and the N21 junction.

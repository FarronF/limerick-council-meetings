**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask the Council to confirm what air and water quality monitoring is currently active in the***

***Limerick Metropolitan area. I would like to know where these monitors are placed, and the***

***reasons for their positioning at these locations. I would like to know how the findings from these***

***monitors can be accessed by the public.***

**REPLY:**

**Air Monitors:**

The Council operates a network of three sets of indicative air quality monitors in the

Metropolitan area. These are located as follows:

The Junction between O'Connell Street and William Street

•

Temple Mungret House, Mungret

•

Castletroy College, Newtown, Castletroy.

One was placed in O'Connell Street to assess the impact of the proposed

redevelopment of O'Connell Street on air quality. The monitors in Mungret and

Castletroy were located away from traffic to show ambient/background air quality

in these areas.

Each of the sets of sensors measure particulates: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide,

nitric oxide, ozone and carbon monoxide.

Real time data from these sensors can be viewed at www.airqweb.com

In addition to the Council network, the EPA has recently installed a high quality

reference monitor in the People's Park. This measures particulates, ozone and

nitrogen dioxide. It was placed in this location to measure background air quality in

the

city

away

from

traffic.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I am calling on the Government to increase the funding for early Childcare Assistants to the level***

***of the living wage which is 12.30 euro per hour.***

As Councillor Slattery was not in attendance, it was agreed to defer this motion.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that**Curragower House,**Clancy Strand be added**to the Record***

***of Protected Structures.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin (B), seconded by Councillor Hartigan and agreed.

**REPLY**:

Curragower House, Clancy Strand, Limerick is the subject of planning application

Reg. No. 18/752 for ‘1 no. private dwelling, 3 no. apartments, 1 no. café unit,

demolition of existing derelict dwelling and associated site works’. A notification of

decision to grant planning permission, with 18 conditions attached, was issued on

March 12, 2019. This decision is currently under appeal to An Bord Pleanala.

If it is in order to initiate the process for making the addition of this building to the

Record of Protected Structure, the Planning Authority will assess the said building

having regard to the eight areas of significance provided for under Part IV

(Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

These are: Architectural, Historical, Archaeological, Artistic, Cultural, Scientific,

Social or Technical interest. This will allow the Planning Authority to ascertain

whether the criteria of significance is met in any, some, or all of these measurements

of importance.

This formal process will also require notification to owner(s), prescribed bodies, and

the public, inviting observations or submissions on the proposal during a 6 weeks

consultation period. Thereafter, within 12 weeks of the closure of the consultation

period, the elected members will make the decision as to whether or not the

addition should be made.

In proposing the motion, Cllr Leddin referred to the contribution that Curragower House has made

to the visual amenity on Clancy Strand. He referred to the prominence of Curragower House, the

visual, architectural and heritage amenity that it contributes to and the importance of including
---

this in the Record of Protected Structures.

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Council declares a Climate and Biodiversity***

***Emergency and support**the Climate Strikes happening country-wide.***

In proposing the motion, Cllr O’Donovan referred to the need for the voices of the people of

Limerick to be listened to and that the Council recognise the Climate Strikes happening country-

wide and leads the rest of Limerick County by declaring a Climate and Biodiversity Emergency, as

other international states and Irish counties have done before. Cllr O’Donovan requested that no

Council meetings would be held during the Climate Action Strike in order to facilitate Councillors

to attend, if they so wished. This motion was seconded by Cllr Hartigan and agreed.

**REPLY**:

On 9th May, 2019 Dáil Éireann declared a national climate emergency during the

debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action. Ireland became

only the second country in the world to make such a declaration.

This declaration has informed national policy development, with the publication of

the national Climate Action Plan 2019 in June of this year. This plan, which deals

with climate change mitigation, sets out ambitious targets for all government

sectors, including local government, setting renewed targets for energy efficiency

and emissions reductions by 2030. Limerick City and County Council is in the early

stages of preparing for the roll out of actions from the Climate Action Plan.

As the Councillor will be aware, the Council has recently adopted a Climate Change

Adaptation Strategy which is designed to make the organisation more aware of and

resilient to the impacts of climate change.

The Council has signed up as a partner to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan, which

promotes the protection and enhancement of biodiversity, and the Council is

The Service Operations section of Limerick City and County Council mobilised when

alerted to the flooding situation in Coonagh on August 31st. The response focused

on the two key areas of the Physical situation in terms of the floodwater ingress and

the Welfare of the homeowners in the area flooded.

An emergency response was provided on the 31st in terms of the deployment of

crews in relation to sandbagging and the deployment of water pumps to reduce

water levels. This continued for a number of days to support the OPW efforts to

repair the breach in the main river bank/wall. This response is completed and the

OPW fix has held to allow water levels return to normal.

From Sunday the 1st of September, 3 of the 4 families who suffered flooding of their

properties availed of the emergency accommodation offered to them. This

accommodation is currently still in operation while the OPW continue to engage

families in the repair of their homes.

In Relation to Na Piarsaigh GAA, Limerick City and County Council had no direct

involvement in terms of an emergency response. We have been informed that the

OPW have engaged the Club and are dealing with the concerns raised in terms of

specialist pitch reports and investigation of electrical issues caused the water

damage.

Regarding the Council’s out of hours service, a total of 25 calls were logged by

Voxpro relating to the flooding, the first at 21:13 on 30th August, the last at

16:44pm on the 1st September. (There were 53 calls to Voxpro during the same

period with the 25 just relating to flooding at Coonagh, the rest related to other

issues).

From Friday evening, the 30th at 9:35pm when calls started to come in to Voxpro,

up to 3am on the morning of Saturday 31st August, the average time customers

were queueing before calls were answered was 1 minute. The longest queue time

was 5 minutes.

Also during this period, there were only 2 abandoned calls. (These are calls that ring

but do not stay on the line to be answered). The average time they stayed on the

line before hanging up was 20 seconds.

There are a minimum of 2 agents available at all times to handle our out of hours

calls and on Friday night when the calls started to come in, additional staff were

brought by Voxpro to answer our calls.

We are currently reviewing the out of hours service with Voxpro to enhance service

provision during periods of high call volumes.

Following further discussion, the Members requested that the Regional Manager of the OPW be

invited to attend the October Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***In line with section 4.3.2 of DMURS to ask the Council to design and implement future crossings***

***as 'uncontrolled'*** ***in Limerick city centre with the objective to:***

***1. To reduce the visual clutter of overdominant flashing beacons and excessive road markings***

***carried out on controlled crossings to date.***

***2. To use a simple palette of materials to denote a crossing to allow the buildings and shopfronts***

***in the city to be the focus, respecting the city's unique architectural setting.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin (B), seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and agreed.

**REPLY**:

Controlled Pedestrian Crossings are used at locations where pedestrian desire lines

are strong and/or crossing users are placed at increased risk because of the nature

of the road. They are frequently used to facilitate school crossing points, where

large numbers of pupils avail of them, or at major city centre pedestrian desire lines.

Controlled crossings are required to meet defined standards, i.e., flashing belusha

beacons, red approach paving and specific road markings.

Where appropriate, uncontrolled crossings are used and these have less restrictive

markings.

It is important to note that uncontrolled crossings are not always appropriate for the

reasons referred to above, but will be considered where site conditions allow.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr O’Hanlon**

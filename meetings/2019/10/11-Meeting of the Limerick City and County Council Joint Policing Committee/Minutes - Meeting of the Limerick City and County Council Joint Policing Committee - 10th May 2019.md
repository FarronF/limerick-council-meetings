**4.RECEIVE UPDATE FROM CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT**

The Chief Superintendent informed Members that there are seventy probationers in Limerick at

present. He introduced the new Superintendent in Newcastle West, Superintendent Aileen Magner,

who replaced Supt John Deasy. Interviews are presently being organised for traffic corps, sergeants

and gardai.

The Senior Crime and Policing Analyst then gave a brief overview on statistics under the following

headings for Limerick City and County per divisional area :

Property Crime (down 13%)

Crimes against persons

Traffic Crimes

Assaults (down 4%)

Traffic Policing

Collisions and Lifesaver Offences

The Chief Superintendent replied to Members queries as follows :

The traffic corp have increased the number of checkpoints and target specific areas. Drug driving is

also being checked and he said he would like to see this expanding. The times of checkpoints have

been spread out and extended. It is hoped to run ‘Operation Cais Lean’ once every month. This

provides high visibility of policing, increase in drug and drink driving tests and supply of drugs. He

agreed to obtain statistics in relation to same for the next meeting.

Training is presently taking place in relation to dealing with drugs and once this is done Gardai will

be more active in relation to the detection of and sale and supply of drugs. The Gardai act on

intelligence most of the time and detections have increased in the last few months. A lot of work

has been put into this area of policing and it is hoped to continue this process.

40% of cases in relation to assaults are withdrawn as a lot of assaults take place while intoxicated

and when the individuals sober up they do not wish to press charges as they usually know the

individual concerned. He added that the Gardai check back with individuals who withdraw assault

cases in relation to domestic crime, however, peoples’ rights not to proceed have to be respected.

There is an increased presence, as much as possible, of gardai on the streets at night.

The issuing of penalty points has been successful to a certain extent but are not the answer to

everything. People modify their behaviour and it is important to ensure that this modified behaviour

continues. He agreed to submit the statistics on check points in the mornings where alcohol from

the night before is still in the persons’ system. He added that 1100 cars have been seized so far this

year and most have not been collected.

He informed Members that there are two people profiling in Limerick for CAB and there are 64 cases

ongoing. There were sizeable seizures in the last twelve months which has resulted in a significant

reduction in the number of flashy cars and huge steps are being taken to ensure anything that

comes to light is followed up on. The number of armed incidents in the city has reduced significantly

also resulting in a quieter more peaceful city.

He stated that the new courthouse building on Mulgrave Street has taken up extra garda resources.

The prison area underneath the courthouse is dealt with by the prison services, however, the gardai

look after the court room and custody area. He added that he contacted the Minister for Justice

recently on this matter and will update Members in due course.

The Chief Superintendent confirmed that crime figures in the city centre have improved and crime

has reduced. The number of gardai patrolling the city centre streets have increased when possible.

He added that he met with Limerick City and County Council recently and identified areas that are

**11.NOTICE OF MOTION SUBMITTED BY COUNCILLOR JOE POND (REFERRED FROM MEETING**

**OF METROPOLITAN DISTRICT OF LIMERICK HELD ON 21ST** **JANUARY, 2019):**

**‘FOLLOWING ONGOING ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IN ANNACOTTY, CASTLETROY, CASTLECONNELL**

**AREAS AND THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW PERMANENT GARDA SERGEANT TO THE**

**CASTLECONNELL GARDA STATION PROVIDING COVER TO ANNACOTTY, CASTLETROY AND**

**CASTLECONNELL AREAS, I MOVE THAT LIMERICK CITY AND COUNTY COUNCIL WOULD ENGAGE**

**WITH THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND THE GARDA COMMISSIONER TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY**

**FUNDING TO ALLOW THE CASTLECONNELL GARDA STATION TO OPEN 24 HOURS DAILY TO SERVE**

**THE NEEDS OF THIS VAST AREA’.**

In reply to Members the Chief Superintendent stated that the provision of a garda station to cover

the areas of Castleconnell/Castletroy/Newtown/Annacotty/University of Limerick is being looked at.

A health and safety report was done on Castleconnell and he accepts that more Gardai are required

in this area. The present premises in Castleconnell is in a very poor condition so this is being looked

at also. He stated that he wrote to the Department of Housing and the Office of Public Works

inviting them to come and examine this building with a view to providing funding as there is no

budget there to rent another premises. What needs to be considered is if there should be two garda

stations to cover the above areas or should they be amalgamated and have just one garda station to

cover all these areas. Discussions are taking place at present.

Superintendent (Mr. D. Smart) stated that there are four guards attached to Castleconnell Garda

Station and when they are off duty the area is covered by Henry Street. Increasing the number of

gardai in this area is presently being looked at and it is intended to have more gardai on the beat in

Castletroy.

Superintendent (Mr. E. O’Neill) stated that there has been a surgence in violent crime in the Roxboro

area and a number of people have been arrested. He pointed out that a lot of hard core policing is

required in the area which requires experienced gardai and also the road network does not help

when dealing with burglaries. He added that the detection of drugs from community policing has

increased significantly.

In reply to Members the Chief Superintendent stated that he would like additional garda stations,

however, these would need additional staff to operate. Glin and Athea Garda Stations have been

done up and are manned with a guard in each one.

**IT WAS AGREED TO TAKE ITEMS 9 AND 12 TOGETHER.**

**9.QUESTION SUBMITTED BY NIALL COLLINS, T.D.:**

**‘I WILL ASK AT THE NEXT MEETING OF LIMERICK’S JPC FOR A REPORT ON THE PREVALENCE AND**

**USE, ILLEGAL OR OTHERWISE, OF QUADS, SCRAMBLERS, ALL TERRAIN BIKES AND SIMILARLY**

**SOCIAL USE, IN PARTICULAR BY MINORS, THE NUMBERS OF SAME SEIZED, IMPOUNDED AND/OR**

**HOUSING ESTATES, PUBLIC PARKS OR CAR PARKS AND FOOTPATHS, THAT TOUGH ROBUST LAWS**

**TO COVER QUAD BIKE AND SCRAMBLER USE BE INTRODUCED TO COVER THE ILLEGAL USE IN THE**

**ABOVE COMMONLY USED AREAS’.**

Superintendent (Mr. E. O’Neill) stated that a lot of offenders who drive quad bikes and scramblers

are children and parents/guardians have to take responsibility. The Gardai are looking at

enforcement and education and are using the CCTV network in dealing with this issue. There have

been five detections in Roxboro and warning notices have also been issued. He added that

Information Stands are going to be set up in Communities highlighting this issue to raise awareness

among parents and children. He pointed out that there is a national debate going on in relation to

skate boards.

This concluded the Meeting.

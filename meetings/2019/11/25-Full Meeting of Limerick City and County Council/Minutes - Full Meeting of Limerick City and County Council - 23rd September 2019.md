QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to

the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

8.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will ask at the next Meeting what is the up-to-date position on the rental equalisation measures**

**due for implementation in the final Quarter of the current financial year.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is continuing the back-office administration to

harmonise two existing schemes in the City and County. In particular, this involves

poverty proofing in excess of 5,000 rent accounts, in addition to linking of I-house

and Agresso systems. In addition to the Limerick City and County Council rent

accounts, it has come to our attention that HAP (Housing Assistance Payment) and

RAS (Rental Accommodation Scheme) tenancies are required to be calibrated also,

and this requires a manual update as they are not configured in the same manner as

Limerick City and County Council’s tenancies. At present, there are approximately

1,200 RAS tenancies and approximately 2,200 HAP tenancies in Limerick.

Given the high number and the manual process required to adjust these, the likely

end-of-year completion, the timing of the prior communication to all tenants and

Elected Members, it is envisaged that the Single Differential Rent Scheme will be

formally introduced in February 2020 by way of Chief Executive’s Order.

A Workshop on the detailed parameters of the new Rent Scheme will be

workshopped with the Elected Members in Quarter 4, 2019, and a date for this will

be advised in the coming weeks with adequate notice.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will ask at the next Meeting what is the scheduled timing of the next Development Plan for the**

**County and City.**

**REPLY:**

The Local Government Reform Act, 2014, made provision for the extension of the

lifetime of both the Limerick City and Limerick County Development Plans pending

the making of a National Planning Framework (NPF) and Regional Spatial and

Economic Strategy (RSES). In accordance with this provision, both Development Plans

were extended with no defined expiration date. The 2018 Planning and Development

(Amendment) Act requires the preparation of a new Development Plan to commence

within 26 weeks of the making of the initial Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy.

The NPF was published on 16th February, 2018, and the RSES, based on current

information, will be adopted by the end of 2019. Therefore, the preparation of the

Limerick City and County Development Plan legally must commence within 26 weeks

of that date. However, given the outdated nature of both plans, it is proposed that

the review will commence with the publication of an Issues Paper in Quarter 2, 2020.

This will commence the statutory 99 week process of preparing a new Development

Plan. The preliminary work will commence in advance of this date and briefing

meetings with the Elected Members will take place in early 2020.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin

**I will ask at the next Meeting that the Council provide details of any traffic studies performed by**

**the Council in 2018/2019 and any traffic volumes collected directly by the Council.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has undertaken traffic counts during 2018/2019 at

the following locations: (i) Golf Links Road, (ii) Grove Island; and (iii) Mungret R510.

Given the amount of data arising from these traffic counts, which would take some

time to collate, it is proposed that if any Member wishes to view the data, access to

same could be facilitated at a time convenient.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin

**I will ask at the next Meeting for a progress report on** **the Council’s plans to develop a cycle lane**

**between Mary Immaculate College and Limerick Institute of Technology.**

**REPLY:**

RPS Consultants have been retained to undertake preliminary design of the cycle

lanes for both Mary Immaculate College and Limerick Institute of Technology to the

city centre routes.

RPS are currently progressing the Limerick Institute of Technology route and Limerick

City and County Council intend lodging Part 8 mid to late October. The Mary

Immaculate College route will follow and it is intended to submit Part 8 before year-

end.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to provide examples of how it adheres to its**

**obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, to incorporate**

**accessibility and universal design for all into planning processes.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council rigorously applies requirements of *Technical*

*Guidance Document M* *–* *Access and Use,* to all developments and includes provision

for people with disabilities. Compliance with Building Standards is set out in law

under the Building Control Acts. Reference documents and standards referred to,

and legislation upheld in the preparation of *Technical Guidance Document M* *–* *Access*

*and Use,* are fully listed at the back of that document.

It is worth noting that among those documents listed are publications produced by

the National Disability Authority. The National Disability Authority is a Statutory

Authority that provides information and advice to the Irish Human Rights and

Equality Commission in its role as the official monitoring body for Ireland’s

compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
---
17

The National Disability Authority’s work includes the development and provision of

statistical information to assist the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in its

review of the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to

the protection of persons with disabilities.

In addition, Limerick City and County Council is liaising with the Older Persons’ Forum

on Public Realm Works in relation to appropriate street furniture specification,

selection of appropriate materials to support ease of movement, location of

accessible car parking spaces, etc.

NOTICES OF MOTION

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Authority review its policy on the forward sale of**

**gravespace within its burial grounds in Co. Limerick.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan emphasised the importance of buying a grave

in advance and referred to cemeteries where this practice is not adhered to. This motion was

seconded by Councillor Teskey. Members referred to various graveyards throughout the County.

Director, Community Development noted their comments and confirmed the mapping of each grave

will be completed as part of the process.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council currently only permits the pre-purchase of

gravespaces at Castlemungret and Ballinagaddy Cemeteries. Limerick City and

County Council is in the process of developing a draft Burial Grounds Strategy and, as

part of the consultation, this policy will be examined further with the relevant

Strategic Policy Committee and Elected Members.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council provide a direct public reps support desk, for**

**example similar to Irish Water, in light of difficulties with the current system; also, that reps made**

**by Councillors to various Departments contact should be made directly by phone or email.**

Councillor Galvin stated that, with the permission of the Mayor, he wished to withdraw this

Motion. This was agreed.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Leddin (to be referred to Travel

and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will allocate 10% of its**

**Transport budget to Cycling.**

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I call on Limerick Council and all relevant Council departments to support the Make Way Day**

**Campaign on September 26th which draws attention to the needs of people with disabilities in**

**public spaces.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan referred to the significance of the campaign

to be held on September 26th and outlined the objectives of the campaign in order to highlight the

barriers that are put in place for people with disabilities when trying to access public footpaths and

walkways. This Motion was seconded by Councillor Donegan.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council declare a Climate and**

**Biodiversity emergency.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan referred to the climate and the serious

implications for the future of our citizens. Councillor Hartigan acknowledged the large crowd who

supported the climate strike march to Merchants Quay last week . This Motion was seconded by

Councillor Scanlan.

**REPLY:**

On 9th May, 2019, Dáil Éireann declared a national climate emergency during the

debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action. Ireland became only

the second country in the world to make such a declaration.

This declaration has informed national policy development, with the publication of

the national Climate Action Plan 2019 in June of this year. This Plan, which deals with

climate change mitigation, sets out ambitious targets for all Government Sectors,

including Local Government, setting renewed targets for energy efficiency and

emissions reductions by 2030. Limerick City and County Council is in the early stages

of preparing for the rollout of actions from the Climate Action Plan.

As the Councillor will be aware, the Council has recently adopted a Climate Change

Adaptation Strategy which is designed to make the organisation more aware of, and

resilient to, the impacts of climate change. The Council has signed up as a partner to

the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan which promotes the protection and enhancement of

biodiversity, and the Council is undertaking a number of pilots dealing with invasive

species, such as three-year Department of Community, Heritage and the Gaeltacht-

funded removal of Giant Hogweed from the River Loobagh catchment, and the

pollinator action areas at three sites in the Metropolitan District – Corbally Meadows,

College Park Meadow and adjacent to the weighbridge on Childers’ Road. These

policies will contribute to the national response to climate action and biodiversity

loss.

With the permission of the Mayor, the following Notice of Motion, in the name of Councillor

Sheehan, was taken:
---

17(a)

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**“That, in view of the concerns regarding passenger numbers at Shannon Airport, Limerick City and**

**County Council write to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to ask him to include**

**Shannon Airport in the Government funding of capital projects; to ask his Department to develop**

**a comprehensive aviation policy to include measures to increase passenger numbers at Shannon**

**and to meet with a delegation of Limerick City and County Council in relation to the future of the**

**airport.”**

In proposing this Motion, Councillor Sheehan outlined to Members the declining passenger

numbers at the airport and referred to their overreliance on London for connectivity. This Motion

was seconded by Councillor Mitchell, and agreed. The Mayor also agreed to issue a letter to Clare

County Council.

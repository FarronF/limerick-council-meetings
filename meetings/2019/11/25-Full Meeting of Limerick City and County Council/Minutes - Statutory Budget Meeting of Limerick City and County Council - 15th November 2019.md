The Mayor opened the Meeting by stating that the Members were required to consider the

Chief Executive’s Draft Budget of Limerick City and County Council for year ending 31st

December, 2020, the Draft Budget having been served in accordance with Section 103 of the

Local Government Act, 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act, 2014.

In recommending the Budget to the Council for consideration, the Chief Executive advised

that the 2020 budget process had significant input and feedback from the Members through

formal Statutory Meetings and numerous Workshops. The Chief Executive stated that the

Budget 2020 process for engagement with Members commenced on September 16th with an

initial Corporate Policy Group meeting. There were two further Corporate Policy Group---
2

meetings held on 14th October and 11th November. This was followed that day with a Full

Council Workshop on the Budget 2020 process, the strategy underpinning the Budget, while

also looking at the Local Property Tax considerations. On 23rd September, the Council made

its decision on the rate of Local Property Tax. Also, the draft budgetary plan was approved by

each of the Municipal Districts and Metropolitan District during 17th to the 23rd October. A

detailed Workshop had been held on Monday, 11th November, where the Draft Budget 2020

was presented to Members, followed by an extensive Question and Answer session which

had assisted in explaining the Budget and its strategy in detail.

In summary, the Chief Executive outlined the extensive consultation with the Corporate Policy

Group, the Municipal Districts and the Full Council, and stated that the views of all the Council

Members across all of these Meetings and Workshops had been comprehensively considered.

It was now necessary to consider the Chief Executive’s draft Budget for 2020, in accordance

with Section 103 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, along with determining the

Annual Rate on Valuation. Also, the 3-year capital programme 2020-2022 would be

considered in accordance Section 135(2) of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended. In

relation to the various proposed Schemes, they would be considered subsequently, as set out

on the agenda. The Chief Executive then provided the Members with an overview of the draft

2020 Budget.

The Chief Executive outlined to Elected Members that this was an important Budget for a

number of reasons. It was the first Budget of the new Council of its five-year term and so it

was setting the platform for the Council’s ambitious plans and strategy moving forward. This

Budget was a balanced Budget and it was building on previous Budgets that consolidated the

Council finances. It allowed for the innovative delivery of many services, programmes and

projects positioning Limerick as an enviable location to live in, invest in and visit. Budget

2020 would allow this progress and strategy to continue to be domestically strong,

internationally focused in a post-Brexit environment, while also delivering on the Council’s

statutory roles and its core local services in and throughout Limerick.

The Budget alsoproposed no increase in the Annual Rate on Valuation for commercial

ratepayers. The proposed Budget Schemes, such as the Small and Medium Business Support

Scheme, Tourism Sector Support Scheme, Business and Retail Incentive Scheme for Vacant

Property and Vacant Property Refund Scheme were specially targeted to assist many key

sectors of the economy.

The Budget ultimately would help underpin the proposed new Corporate Plan which would

be presented at the next Council Meeting. This would give full expression to the Budget

strategy and begin the planning for a transition to the proposal for a Directly Elected Mayor

in Limerick.

The Chief Executive stated that job creation and investments were powering ahead. Limerick

was continuing to be one of the top performing investment locations in Ireland. Limerick had

delivered more than 17,000 jobs in the last six years, with more than 1,500 jobs announced

since January 2019, including new investments from Nautilus Technologies, Fund Rock and---
3

QAD, and expanding facilities such as Regeneron, J&J, Becton Dickinson, BDO, EY, to name

but a few. Overall unemployment was down to 6.1% from a high of 17% in 2010.

The Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC investments were paying off. The recently completed, award-

winning Gardens International was almost fully let after an 18-month €17.6million build.

The eagerly awaited development of the Opera Project was progressing through planning and

the Cleeves Site master planning was underway for a major new development on the

riverside. The Budget also supported the development of the Cityxchange project, a keystone

of the recently approved Digital Strategy.

2019 was another successful year for Innovate Limerick as it continued to expand its functions

with key highlights including:

 The purchase of the former Shannon Development Enterprise site in Kilmallock.

 The purchase of a building in Main Street, Abbeyfeale, that would be fitted out as an E-

Hub in 2020.

 Finishing works in the Business Park in Rathkeale that had provided space for several new

operations, including Design Pro, the Butterfly Club, Mid-West Suicide Prevention and a

new E-hub which would open in 2020.

 Getting funding approval from Enterprise Ireland to expand ENGINE on Cecil Street to

accommodate a new Digital Collaboration Centre to be constructed in 2020.

 Employing the first Regional Film Manager to promote and target growth in the Film/TV

industry in the Limerick and Mid-West Region

The announcement of the UL City Centre Campus development was a game-changer for

Limerick and it would prove, in time, to be a signature investment for Limerick and the Mid-

West Region. In addition, the new proposals for Bishops Quay were welcome, while

continuing the development of the Quayside and wider Riverfront.

The budget also supported the launch and implementation of Limerick’s revitalised brand

identity launching early next year. Limerick City and County Council would target investment,

domestic and international tourism like never before. A powerful new message had been

developed to convey the attitude and advantages Limerick uniquely deliverd for complex,

multi-faceted audiences at home and abroad.

The Council was confident that amplifying its new narrative nationally and internationally

would build on its continuing resurgence. The new Tourism Strategy was targeting over 1m

visitors per annum and would seek the development of new products and festivals beginning

in 2020 that were enabled by the Budget. The recent announcement of the 2026 Ryder Cup

for Limerick and other major sporting events would be supported by the Council’s strategy.

**Community**

Budget 2020 would actively allow for the further engagement with, and support of,

communities. It would address enhancing quality of life for citizens by supporting new public

realm projects and programmes across the City and County in libraries, galleries, museums,

cultural and arts centres, and across events.---
4

It would also focus on the dereliction/vacancy issue and delivery of public realm

improvements in urban areas and villages that would animate the public space and support

place-making activities.

**Housing**

As a Local Authority, the Council continued to ensure that the housing challenge was

addressed in a focused and concerted manner across its Build, Buy and Lease Programmes in

order to meet its targets on the Rebuilding Ireland Programme. Limerick City and County

Council would work towards providing the enabling infrastructure for key sites in its

ownership to allow for the eventual delivery of affordable homes in Limerick through Serviced

Sites Funding. Strong collaboration with Approved Housing Bodies would continue as a means

of enhancing delivery mechanisms, while also providing additional services to tenants. The

roll-out of the planned Maintenance Programme would commence in 2020 and would include

a Pilot Maintenance Grant Scheme for tenants in the Kilmallock area.

**Physical**

Provision was also made in the Budget to progress key infrastructural projects, such as the

Foynes to Limerick Route, the Cork to Limerick Motorway, the O’Connell Street Urban

Renewal Project and many others. The Budget would strengthen the Council’s commitment

to Climate Change 2020 targets, addresses Public lighting innovation and enable it to address

the CFRAMS and Flood Relief Schemes.

**Operationally**

The Budget would allow the Council to meet its commitments to continue the delivery of

essential and statutory services in Housing Maintenance, Roads, Libraries and Fire Services.

It would allow the Council to be efficient, effective and committed to providing services that

would underpin a growing and dynamic Limerick.

**Staffing**

Recruitment had increased during 2019 to fill priority positions because of retirements and

promotions. The Workforce Planning Programme would be progressed further during 2020

to further ensure that the structures were in place to fully support effective service delivery.

The professionalism, commitment and determination of staff to react to unforeseen events

was again demonstrated in 2019 during the many storms and weather events that had to be

dealt with.

The Budget also made clear the Council’s Capital Works Programme for the next three years

2020-2022 which was included with the Budget documentation. This programme, which was

wide-ranging over the 3-year period for public projects for Limerick, was projected to cost

€703 million, which was funded from, in the main, central grants and loans.---
5

The Chief Executive stated that the draft Budget 2020 - which included significant feedback

from Members in its development - had committed to further improve service delivery. The

Members’ decision to vary the rate of Local Property Tax had facilitated this commitment. No

increase in commercial rates was proposed.

Finally, the Chief Executive thanked the Mayor and Elected Members for all their assistance

and guidance in framing the Budget. He also thanked his colleagues on the Management

Team and their Senior Teams for developing the Budget and sometimes for sharing the pain

with him to make a balanced Budget. He said he would particularly like to thank all the

Finance Team for the dedicated work and support to all during the process which, he was

sure, the Members would agree was exemplary.

In conclusion, he recommended the draft Budget, as presented, to the Members for adoption.

**It was unanimously agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Budget 2020, as**

**circulated to Members, would be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:**

**“Introduction**

The Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December 2020 has been prepared,

circulated to Members and public notice of the Budget Meeting placed in the press, in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014.

Circular Fin 07/2019 refers to the prescribed period that applies for the holding of the 2020

Budget meeting for Local Authorities as follows; 1st November 2019 to 30th November 2019.

It was agreed by the Members at the September Council meeting to hold the statutory Annual

Budget Meeting on Friday 15th November 2019 at 10am, in the Council Chamber, Dooradoyle.

Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local Government Reform

Act 2014 provides that the Budget must be adopted within a period of 14 days beginning on

the day on which the local authority budget meeting meets. The Budget therefore must be

adopted by 29th November 2019.

**Budget Process**

The budget process for the preparation, consideration and adoption of the budget requires

statutory compliance with a number of steps, which can be summarised as follows:

***Step 1 - Decision by the Council on the adjustment factor to the Local Property Tax (LPT)***

***following a public consultation process.*** This decision was made at the Council Meeting on

the 23rd September.---
6

***Step 2 - Allocation of the General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation (GMA).The Draft*

*Budgetary Plan was considered at the following meetings:*

Metropolitan District of Limerick

18th October

Adare / Rathkeale Municipal District

23rd October

Cappamore / Kilmallock Municipal District

17th October

Newcastle West Municipal District

23rd October

***Step 3 - Consultation with the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) and adoption of the Draft***

***Budget by Council.*** Budget Strategy presented to CPG Meeting held on the 16th September

with further meetings held on the 14th October and 11th November. The Statutory Budget

meeting is scheduled for 15th November with a budget workshop with Councillors to be held

on the 11th November.

***Step 4 - Consideration and adoption of the schedule of Municipal works by each of the***

***Metropolitan / Municipal Districts.*** These meetings will be convened in early 2020 following

the adoption of the Budget.

***Step 5 - Consideration and adoption of the Service Delivery Plan.*** The 2020 Service Delivery

Plan will be presented to Council at the January 2020 Council meeting.

Through consultation with the Corporate Policy Group and consideration of the views of

Council as expressed through the different stages of the budgetary process, in particular as

expressed through the meetings of the Municipal/ Metropolitan Districts, the budget as

presented considers this feedback in a reasoned and balanced manner.

At the Statutory Budget Meeting, the Members will be asked to make the following decisions:

 Adopt the Budget with or without amendment

 Determine the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV)

 Determine the proportion of Rates Refund applicable on vacant commercial premises.

**National Economic Outlook**

The external economic environment has become more challenging. Rising trade tensions,

wider geopolitical developments and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit have raised

uncertainty and, accordingly, dampened investment. In addition, growth in global trade has

slowed considerably, partly because of the softening in investment (trade in investment

goods is an important component of world trade). Country-specific developments are also

contributing to the global slowdown: a fading fiscal stimulus in the US, difficulties in the auto

sector in Germany and the slowing Chinese economy. The year-long trend of softening

growth is set to persist into 2020. In the euro area, incoming data have disappointed over the

summer and have prompted a re-starting of the ‘Quantitative Easing’ programme by the

European Central Bank. Many of these factors are inter-related and, at least at this stage,

appear unlikely to subside in the near-term.---
7

The UK exit out of the EU will dent economic activity in the final quarter of this year and

severely impact it next year. GDP growth of just 0.7 per cent is forecast for next year, although

given the unprecedented nature of a Brexit shock, the uncertainty attached to this point-

estimate is much higher than normal, with risks highly skewed to the downside.

On the back of very strong export figures in the first half of the year, particularly on the

services side, the Department of Finance has revised upwards its forecast for GDP growth this

year to 5.5 per cent, an upward revision of just over 1½ percentage points. This projection

would be closer to 6 per cent were it not for the assumed impact of a no-deal Brexit in the

fourth quarter.

Finance's budget for 2020.

**Table 1: Summary of Main Economic and Fiscal Variables (per cent change (unless stated))**

Source: Department of Finance Economic and Fiscal Outlook Budget 2020, p.2

The Local Government Sector is part of General Government (as is the Local Government

Fund). Own-resource Local Authority (LA) expenditure is profiled to stay broadly flat in 2020,

this means that own-resource expenditure must stay in line with last year unless specific

revenue raising measures are identified (i.e. increased rates, LPT, housing rents, parking fees,

planning fees, library and sports facility fees, casual trading fees etc. ). So, expenditure policy

at the sub-General Government level will have serious implications for national fiscal policy -

expenditure increases in the LA & other sectors with own resource income will have to be

met by offsetting expenditure reductions in voted expenditure to ensure compliance with

fiscal rules.---

**Local Outlook:**

2019 has seen many significant milestones occur for Limerick City and County as we continue

our ambitious plans to develop Limerick into the future. The launch of Limerick’s new brand

in 2020 will help win further indigenous and foreign investment and reflect its resurgence as

a thriving economic and visitor destination.

Tourism will be a key priority for Limerick City and County Council throughout 2020. Elected

members have facilitated this focus through an increase in the Local Property Tax. There will

be a significant focus on the upgrading of the Great Southern Greenway, the promotion of

Lough Gur and the implementation of the Limerick Tourism Development strategy

throughout 2020 with further improvements also planned in Limerick’s Medieval Quarter and

the development plan for Limerick city as a gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way. We will also

progress the RRDF funded West Limerick Tourism Gateway/ Fullers Folly Project in Newcastle

West.

In 2020, we will assist in the planning for the JP McManus Pro-Am in Adare in and continue

to prepare for the 2026 Ryder Cup in conjunction with key stakeholders.

We will maximise funding opportunities for rural Limerick through various Government

schemes and continue to advance the dereliction, vacancy and reuse programme including

advancing key public realm projects through the additional resources provided by the Local

Property Tax.

A key area of focus will be to provide advice to our communities on grant schemes and other

Council led support measures including facilitating the work of the LCDC, securing maximum

level of funding from funding calls. We will continue to advance initiatives on Age Friendly

and Integration.

The local authority will invest in our festival and events through the implementation of a new

Festivals and Events strategy to be prepared in 2020. A key event for next year will be the

European Expo which was supported by a Festival Innovation Fund created by the members

in 2019.

Next year, we will strengthen the role of our libraries, gallery and museum. We will also

prepare a new Sports and Recreation Facilities strategy in 2020 to enhance the quality of life

of all our citizens.

As a local authority, we continue to ensure that the housing challenge is being addressed in a

focused and concerted manner across our Build, Buy and Lease programmes. With a focus

on the delivery of targets under the ‘Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and

Homelessness’, we are looking at ways of improving our processes and procedures to bring

greater efficiency and value for money in the services we provide to our tenants and to the

wider citizen. Limerick City and County Council will work towards providing the enabling

infrastructure for key sites in our ownership to allow for the eventual delivery of affordable

homes in Limerick through Serviced Sites Funding. Strong collaboration with Approved---
9

Housing Bodies will continue as a means of enhancing delivery mechanisms while also

providing additional services to our tenants.

The roll-out of the planned maintenance programme will commence in 2020 and will include

a pilot maintenance grant scheme for tenants in the Kilmallock area. A single point of contact

for vacant properties allows the council to gather data to get the most up to date and

accurate information about vacant units and their status. There will also be increased

resources in 2020 for estate management in partnership with tenants and residents

committees. The Single Differential Rent Scheme has been an important step to ensure fair

calculation of rents and a focus will remain on its implementation throughout 2020.

Compliance with NZEB (Near Zero Energy Building) means that our works will, in time, result

in a more sustainable and energy efficient housing stock. As works are completed, this will

lead to a reduction in the running costs for our tenants and a reduced dependency on fossil

fuels. An energy efficient house has also proved to provide better comfort and living

standards.

After six years of unprecedented growth in which Limerick delivered more than 17,000 jobs,

the Limerick Economic Monitor was established as a barometer to give us twice yearly

progress reports as to where we are, benchmarking us against our local and indeed national

targets as per Limerick 2030 and Project Ireland 2040.

Limerick’s economy continues to perform well, positioning itself as an affordable and

attractive alternative to Dublin, in spite of challenges on the horizon in the shape of Brexit

and a possible international slowdown.

On the jobs front, more than 1,500 roles have been announced for Limerick since January

2019. Companies which have made important announcements during the year include world

brands such as Becton Dickinson, Fundrock and major accounting firms have further invested

in the region. Irish Water also announced the establishment of its national laboratory services

in Limerick creating up to 120 jobs.

The eagerly awaited development of the Opera site, the University of Limerick’s €8m

investment plan for a city centre campus and the increasing workforce of global firms will

help to improve the city centre and facilitate its resurgence.

A central pillar for Limerick’s continued resurgence will be Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic

Development DAC. This time last year, with two years behind the project, we looked forward

to a big 12 months in 2019 for this special purpose Company established to develop key

strategic but disused Limerick sites into engines of economic growth. It has been that and

more but the momentum is only gathering, with 2020 set to be another major year for the

Limerick Twenty Thirty project.

Before we close the 2019 chapter, it’s worth recalling that, with Troy Studios already up and

running, the first major build under Limerick Twenty Thirty, Gardens International, was

completed and opened. The 112,000 sq. ft development was finished to tenant fit-out stage---
10

after an 18 month build. The project has been built to LEED Gold standards - among the top

international benchmarks for sustainability.

Further evidence of the momentum being gathered with the Limerick Twenty Thirty

programme was a planning application lodged by Limerick City and County Council for the

biggest project in its portfolio, the Opera Site, with work on this monumental project for

Limerick destined to commence in 2020, subject to planning.

The Opera Site, which was acquired by Limerick City Council in 2011 will be transformational

for the city and region. With an oral hearing pending, the Opera Site will be developed over a

six-year period, starting with a six-month demolition programme in 2020. The demolition and

build will cost circa €180m and take shape over a six-year period. It is fully funded thanks to

finance facilities from the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development

Bank.

The site will be capable of employing up to 3,000 people across a 450,000 sq ft campus

accommodation and, like Gardens International, it will again have a high bar in terms of

sustainability and architectural standing, with the project being developed to LEED Gold and

Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) standards.

2020 will also see further steps taken on the Cleeves Riverside Quarter project, with the

appointment of consultants to assist in its development pending. The project will then move

onto the actual planning stage, with a planning application targeted for 2021.

The Cleeves Riverside Quarter is an iconic site of approximately 10 acres located on the

northern bank of the River Shannon in Limerick city centre. It is zoned 'City Centre Area' in

the City Development Plan, and deemed suitable for a number of uses including commercial,

residential and educational. In terms of scale, Cleeves will be one of the biggest city centre

developments outside of Dublin.

Next year will also see progress on another key project in the Limerick Twenty Thirty

programme, the Mungret Park development. Currently at master-planning stage, a planning

application is set to be lodged next year for the first phase of this residential project.

Innovate Limerick continues to extend the range of activities at ENGINE to include the

PROSPER indicative which is run in conjunction with the Guinness Enterprise Centre in Dublin.

Plans are now being prepared to extend ENGINE by 1,500 sq metres to accommodate the

Digital Collaboration Centre, which will facilitate greater interaction between multinational

and indigenous companies based in the region.

With a newly appointed regional film manager in place, the film sector can make a significant

contribution to the region’s economic growth going forward. Innovate has also purchased a

premises on the Main Street in Abbeyfeale and the design team have been appointed to

convert that building into a much needed E-Hub for the town.

2020 will see the launch of Limerick’s new brand to help win further indigenous and foreign

investment and reflect its resurgence as a thriving economic and visitor destination.---
11

The Mid West National Road Design Office continues to progress key major infrastructural

projects in the region in partnership with the participating local authorities and Transport

Infrastructure Ireland. Some of the schemes currently being progressed by the office include

the M/N20 Cork to Limerick, Foynes to Limerick (Including Adare Bypass), N21 Newcastle

West Bypass, N21 Abbeyfeale Bypass, N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction, N19 Shannon Airport

Access Road in addition to other major, minor, pavement and safety schemes.

The Council, in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, has progressed the

development of the transport strategy for Limerick with completion expected in 2020. This

strategy will examine how sustainable transport can be delivered in Limerick and will guide

investment decisions. It will build on previous transport studies carried out and will set out

proposed actions and measures for delivering infrastructural development and policy.

The Council adopted the Limerick City and County Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in July

2019 in accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. This will

be added to in 2020 with the development of a Climate Mitigation Strategy, as required by

the Climate Action Plan 2019.

Provision has been made in budget 2020 to advance studies and schemes which will allow the

Council to prepare to meet the targets set out under national climate change policy, including

building the resilience of the organisation to respond to climate change events, the promotion

of green infrastructure, increased energy efficiency and emissions reduction targets, fleet

improvement, building performance, promotion of sustainable and alternative transport

modes.

In recognition of its commitment to environmental and sustainability issues, Limerick was

awarded the title of European Green Leaf City 2020 along with Mechelen in Belgium. During

2020 the Council will organise and host a number of environmental events aimed at raising

and awareness and providing exemplars of best practice around the Biodiversity and Land

use, Climate Change and Energy Performance, Sustainable Urban Transport, Waste and the

Circular Economy, Air Quality and Noise and Water.

**Budget Strategy & Objectives**

The Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the

overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory,

contractual, legal and other obligations. It incorporates the decisions made by the Council in

relation to the Local Property Tax and General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocations. Under

the Local Government Act, 2001 as amended, the Draft Budget is required to set out the

expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the Council and the income estimated to

accrue to the Council.

The key objectives of the 2020 Budget are set out in the Table below:---

**Outturn 2019**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2020 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

The Annual Financial Statement of Limerick City and County Council for the year 2018 shows

the accumulated balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit position of €823,400.  I have

reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to break-

even on the Revenue Account for 2019; however there is pressure on a number of income

heads and ongoing controls on expenditure are in place. The impact of the windfarm appeals

has been highlighted to members during 2019 and this could impact adversely in achieving a

balanced outturn. The 2020 draft Budget reflects the need to continue a strong financial

management ethos while making every effort to meet the ever increasing demands on the

services of Limerick City and County Council.

**Analysis of Expenditure Requirements 2020**

The total estimated expenditure included in the Draft Budget for 2020 amounts to

€825.408million, an increase of €135.824 million on the adopted figure for 2019. The growth

in the HAP transactional Shared Service Center accounts for the majority of this increase. As

this expenditure is matched by an increase in corresponding income, it has no net effect on

the Budgetary Provisions. The following Table 2 depicts Revenue expenditure by Division.

Comparative figures for Budgets 2020 and 2019 are shown hereunder.

**Chart 4: Analysis of Income:** **Draft Budget 2020 v’s Budget 2019**

**Local Property Tax Allocation 2020**

Local Property Tax (LPT) is now a key funding source for Local Government replacing the

General Purpose Grant funding allocation. The initial allocation under this funding heading

was confirmed as €17,554,464. The basis of this funding is an allocation of 80% of the LPT

collected from property owners in the City and County and retained by the Local Authority

with the remaining 20% being paid into an equalisation fund from which payments are made

to Counties not achieving a level of funding equivalent to the 2013 General Purpose Grant

(GPG) through their own LPT receipts.

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 and associated Regulations permits the Members of

the Council to vary the Rate by a maximum increase or decrease of 15%. The Council decided

to adjust the LPT rate upwards by 15% in 2020 equating to an increase of €2,359,791.

The 2020 allocation from the Local Property Tax and the calculation provided by the DHPLG

on the basis of this allocation is set out in ***Table 4*** below:

**Table 5: Allocation of additional resources**---
18

The additional 7.5% Local Property Tax on 2019 levels has enabled the Council to have an

additional €1.15m for Budget 2020 above Budget 2019 which is used to provide additional

funding for capital investment in new plant to deliver efficient local resources (€400k), enable

a greater focus on Urban and Rural Regeneration (€550k), and provide an additional amount

for General Municipal Allocation (GMA) (€200k).

The additional monies for Urban and Rural Regeneration has enabled the provision of a Trade

and Investment executive, Festival and events co-ordinator, provision of technical

engineering expertise to ensure Urban and Rural Regeneration projects are managed, and

also provide additional staff resource to the Museum to enable 7 day a week opening.

**Commercial Rates**

Commercial Rates is a significant contributor to the total budgeted income for the Council

and it is vital to the level of service delivery that income from this source is maximised. In this

respect it is critically important that the Valuation Office reverts promptly with new valuations

during 2020. Limerick City and County Council will continue to ensure that all commercial

properties in the City and County are included on the rates records and are properly rated.

The Council continues to improve its collection percentages across all the major income

headings. In that respect engagement with rate-payers with a view to addressing arrears will

continue to be a priority during 2020. In circumstances where there is no engagement, the

Council will pursue the outstanding arrears via the legal route.

The Valuation Office carried out a full revaluation of commercial properties in Limerick City

and County areas in 2014. The principal of the revaluation process exercise was that it is

revenue neutral ((i.e. no financial loss or gain to the Local Authority). Limerick City and County

Council has, however experienced significant erosion of its commercial rates income as a

result of these appeals with a loss to date of €1.08m per annum. There are seven outstanding

appeals from Windfarms to be adjudicated by the Valuation Tribunal which could result in

further financial losses from reduced Commercial Rates of €706k per annum (arrears of

€3.5m), bringing potential losses to €1.7m per annum. Limerick City and County Council are

the first Local Authority to object to a decision of the Valuation Tribunal

This financial loss in Commercial Rates for 2020 due to the windfarms’ appeals, has been part

mitigated by the Council receiving some Rates buoyancy and an increase in Commercial Rates

income due to Irish Water now being rated as a global valuation utility and accounted for in

Commercial Rates rather than as compensation from the Department of Housing, Planning

and Local Government.

**Vacant Property Scheme 2020**

Section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for an amendment to rating

law in relation to the refund of rates on vacant properties. This change now gives the power

to the members of local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual

local electoral areas within the overall administrative area of the local authority.---
19

Article 29 of the Local Government (Financial & Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provides

that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be decided at the statutory annual budget

meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area

shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The budget has been

framed on the basis the refund rates on vacant property noted in ***Table 6*** below.

The following amended vacant property scheme is proposed to continue in 2020:

**Band**

**% Refund**

Up to €2,856 Annual Rate Demand

100%

€2,857 to €11,376 Annual Rate Demand (with payment

of 50% required)

€11,377 to €57,024 Annual Rate Demand (with

payment of 75% required)

25%

Over €57,025 Annual Rate Demand (with payment of

90% required)

10%

**Table 6: Proposed Vacant Property Scheme 2020**

**Small and Medium Business Support Scheme 2020 (SME Scheme)**

The proposed Small and Medium Business Support scheme will pay a financial support to

occupiers of commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €25,000 but not less than €1 in 2020. The proposed % support for 2020 rates is 9%

subject to a maximum refund of €1,000 which will be subject to a number of terms and

conditions, including 25% of arrears must be paid in year 1 to qualify for the scheme with a

payment plan in place over years 2 to 4 for the remaining arrears.

**Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2020**

The Proposed Tourism Sector Support Scheme for 2020 will be a financial support/reduction

to occupiers of commercial properties directly linked to the Tourism Sector. In order to

qualify, the total annual Commercial Rates liability must be in excess of €25,000 (Businesses

with a Rate Demand less than €25,000 already qualify for the SME Scheme 2020) and is

subject to a number of terms and conditions. The support grant payment which is aimed

specifically at the Tourism and Hospitality Sector will be set at 4% of the total Rates, including

arrears, up to a maximum grant payment of €5,000, for 2020 subject to the Scheme being

approved by the Council.

**Business & Retail Incentive Scheme 2020**

The Proposed Business & Retail Incentive Scheme for 2020 will continue to be available for

businesses in all towns and villages across Limerick City and County Council. The scheme is

intended to address property vacancy rates, improve streetscapes and to support the

business community.---
20

**Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Transactional Shared Service Centre**

The Housing Assistant Payment (HAP) is the principal platform for underpinning the provision

of housing support in Ireland. The availability of HAP means that all Local Authorities can

provide housing support to many more households with a long-term housing need, including

many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. HAP is delivered across 31 local authorities in

the State. It is supported by the shared service centre operated on behalf of the local

government sector by Limerick City and County Council. Total annual expenditure on HAP is

expected to be in excess of €950 million by 2021.There are currently over 51,000 tenancies

supported nationally.

HAP is particularly attractive for low income households, as they can work full time and they

pay the local authority a weekly rent contribution based on their ability to pay. The HAPSSC

will process circa 15,000 new tenancies in 2020 and process €614million in payments to HAP

landlords and collect €150million in differential rent from HAP tenants. The HAPSSC which is

city centre based currently employs 74 staff.

The key business processes delivered on behalf of the Local Authorities by the HAP Shared

Services Centre are (1) Tenancy Processing, (2) Weekly Tenant Rent Run, (3) Monthly Landlord

Payment, (4) Tax Clearance Certificate Compliance, (5) Amendments, (6) Debt Management,

(7) Recoupment Management and (8) Stakeholder Reporting. The HAP Shared Services

Centre is ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System certified.

**General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation 2020**

Circular Fin 08/2015 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)

(Amendment) Regulations (S.I.363 of 2015), which amends the Local Government (Financial

and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 by providing that the meeting at which Municipal/

Metropolitan members consider the draft budgetary plan must conclude no later than 10

days prior to the local authority budget meeting.

Following the adoption of the budget a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and

repairs to be carried out during 2020 in each Municipal/ Metropolitan District will be prepared

for consideration and adoption by the Municipal/ Metropolitan District Members.

The draft budget has included a general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocation of €1.403m in

total for district members, which will provide a focus and clarity as regards how the elected

members want to account for the expending of monies within their area.

**Workforce**

Recruitment of staff within the Organisation will continue and in particular will focus on the

replacement of staff following retirements, promotions and departures.---
21

As a major employer in the region, it is important that we provide employment opportunities

to the communities we serve. In this regard, an Apprenticeship Programme will be launched

in 2020. The Graph below shows our overall numbers at present and the number of retired

staff, which will rise significantly towards the end of 2019.

**Chart 5: Analysis of staff numbers and number receiving pensions 2014-2019**

**Business Improvement Department:**

Our Public Service 2020 provided a policy framework to build on previous reforms and

Limerick City and County Council has a dedicated Business Improvement team to embed this

framework into our organization.

The Business Improvement department provides support to the organization in the

assessment of service delivery for efficiency and effectiveness. Using a recognized

improvement approach, the team assists in mapping and standardizing processes to remove

any waste ensuring we are producing value for money services that provide the best customer

experience. Involving the public in the design of their services is key in producing accessible

services that meet an increasing demand to be delivered digitally but also in more traditional

forms. Customer engagement is sought online and during citizen feedback sessions and it is

this citizen participation that will continue to shape our services.

Data is also critical in informing our ability to make evidence based decisions and our internal

CRM system is connected to our Service Catalogue which allows us to assess the demand for

our services, see where there are gaps and allows us to be proactive in deciding budgets and

resource allocation that will meet our citizen demands. The Business Improvement

Department have also launched Cora, our cloud based project management system. This

system will provide the organization with project status and financial reporting data that

assists in monitoring progress, budgets and ensures our priorities are aligned with our

Corporate Goals.

**Irish Water**

The Budget provides for the ongoing Service Level Agreement (SLA) arrangements with Irish

Water as Limerick City and County Council provides water services on behalf of the national

water authority. The Budget includes provision for the expenditure associated with the

operation of the SLA and for the recoupment of these costs from Irish Water.

**Capital Budget 2020-2022**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, please find attached a report on the programme of capital

projects proposed by Limerick City and County Council for the 3 years 2020 to 2022.

A key element of the Capital Programme over the coming years is delivering on the Limerick

2030 plan. Council members agreed to the raising of a working capital loan in 2014 of €32m

and in 2017 approved loans of €170m from the European Investment Bank and Council of

Europe Development Bank to help fund this programme. Also, The Rural Regeneration &

Development Fund and the Urban Regeneration & Development Fund will provide funding

opportunities for the Council to develop strategic projects.

Given the fact that we are proposing allocations over 3 years, it would be unrealistic to

suggest that these allocations are definitive and are subject to funding being available in

future years. Capital projects by their very nature are flexible rolling plans which involve an

annual review and possible adjustment. Below please find a summary of potential spend and

source of funding for the 3 year capital plan 2020 to 2022.

**Conclusion**

Limerick City and County Council will in the coming weeks adopt a new Corporate Plan for the

period 2019 to 2024 which will set out the Council’s ambition to continue to position Limerick

as the driver for the mid-west and to build on the foundations of the renaissance that have

unfolded in Limerick.

The Council, since its inception in 2014, has positioned itself as a proactive organisation to

serve the people of Limerick. The transition to a directly elected mayor with executive powers

is a fundamental change in local government and will again require significant cultural change

within the organisation.

The proposed Draft Budget for 2020 will maintain existing services to a high standard and

ensure that Limerick City and County Council fulfils all its current statutory and regulatory

obligations.

The demand for services across Limerick continues to grow and this is matched by public

expectation. Our Customer Service is connected to our service catalogue, which allows us to

access the demand for services, see where the gaps are and allow us to be proactive in

allocating budgets and staffing levels that align with our citizen demands.

Limerick City and County Council will also facilitate economic development by progressing key

capital projects including Urban and Village Renewal while also marketing Limerick as a great

place to visit and do business.

During 2019, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events, which demonstrated the

professionalism, commitment and determination of staff to manage the impact of these

events.

The draft 2020 budget has been prepared with no proposed increase in Commercial Rates

ARV (Annual Rate on Valuation), and reflects the decision by elected members to increase

rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) by a further 7.5% for 2020 on the 2019 LPT levels. This

increase will enable the Council to further improve service delivery.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and the Elected Members for their

assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy Group in preparing

this budget.

I also wish to express my appreciation to the Management Team and their own teams for

their commitment and hard work in preparing this document. The coming year will again be

challenging but offers significant opportunities.

I look forward to the full support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to be held

Friday, 15th November 2019.”

The Mayor stated that the Deputy Chief Executive would provide an overview of the draft

Revenue Account for 2019 and the proposed 3-year Capital programme. Following this, he

would go through each Division in detail with a summary update of the corresponding Capital

programmes.

Following Deputy Chief Executives overview, the Mayor confirmed that this concluded the

review of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the Members would be afforded the

opportunity for questions and answers in relation to each division.

The Mayor confirmed that this concluded the review of all Divisions within the Revenue

Account. He then asked for a Proposer for the draft Budget, as presented.

**Councillor Sheahan (J)**

Councillor Sheahan (J), on behalf of the Fine Gael Group, welcomed the first budget of the

new council and referred to the prosperity that the City & County had experienced over the

last 5 years. Councillor Sheahan referred to the challenges that the Council will face in the

next term but will continue to act on behalf of the constituents and allocate the available

resources accordingly. Councillor Sheahan referred to the capital expenditure for the 3year

programme of €702.91m with expenditure of €217.05m proposed for next year and the draft

Revenue Budget for 2020 is set at a total of €825.4m.  He stated that this is the first year that

the Council’s budget including Revenue and Capital exceeds €1 billion.  Councillor Sheahan

referred to the national housing and homelessness crisis and welcomed the additional---
25

Homeless provision of €1.8m increase to a total of €6.7m. He welcomed the overall with

increases in Housing Maintenance with a Housing Maintenance Budget now set at €11.22m

which also includes provision for planned maintenance loan of €15m over a 4 year period

€621k) to allow for proactive upgrade of the housing stock.

Councillor Sheahan welcomed the increase of €4.83 in the Roads Budget and year on year to

a total Budget of €44.25m with increases in National Primary Roads & allocation of €1.2m

based on 2019 allocations & €2.8m increase in Local and Regional Roads due to Grant

increases with increases in Roads own resources allocation of €260k for Draft Budget 2020.

Councillor Sheahan emphasised the importance of maintaining public amenities.

Councillor Sheahan referred to the climate change and the need for the council to be

proactive and referred to the additional provision in the budget for a Public Lighting Loan

for installation of energy efficient LED lighting and acknowledged the work of the work of

the Climate Action, Biodiversity & Environment SPC council to reduce our carbon footprint.

The Council’s Budget for 2020 has also included provisions to include Noise Action Plan

€15,000, Air Quality Monitoring €14,000, Contribution to CFRAMS €35,000, Climate Action

Change contribute of €50,000.

Water is largely funded via the Irish Water Service Level Agreement with the Council and

referred to the EPA report in relation to the pumping of raw sewerage into the River which

is not acceptable.

Councillor Sheahan also referred to the importance of culture and festivals and the positive

impact these events have on towns and villages. He also referred to the increase in

Economic Development and promotion, which is vital for the continued growth of the City &

County. He also referred to the additional monies allocated from the increase in the LPT to

replace plant and machinery. Councillor Sheahan acknowledged the success of the Small

and Medium Business Support Scheme since its introduction and commended the Council

on being the first local authority to do so. Councillor Sheahan formally proposed the draft

Budget as presented.

**Councillor Collins (M)**

Councillor Collins (M), on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Group, confirmed that it was his 15th

budget since being elected in 2004 and is intrigued that year on year at the revenue growth

in our budget. The 2020 expected expenditure is estimated at €825.5m. Councillor Collins

acknowledged the fantastic work that has gone into the preparation of this draft Budget.

I want to particularly single out Sean Coughlan Deputy Chief Executive for simplifying what

can be a complex and intricate document and making himself available along with the Chief

Executive to work with Councillor Collins and his FF colleagues.

Councillor Collins commended the team in Finance along with all Directors and their staff in

presenting a balanced budget here today. Councillor Collins also mentioned the management---
26

and staff members of the Municipal District offices along with the outdoor staff who do

sterling work in all types of weather and often in unsociable hours.

Councillor Collins stated that the draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a

“balanced budget” based on the overall level of resources available to the Council and the

requirement to meet statutory, contractual, legal and other obligations. As in previous years

not every member will agree with this draft Budget today but it's imperative that we highlight

the benefits with increased spending in many areas that will benefit citizens city and county

wide. Limerick is dealing with a hugely increased budget this year of €825.5m up from

€689.5m last year. Notwithstanding the fact that HAP Shared Services is a major part of this

budget at €641.7m the overall budget is a strong indicator at how well positioned we are in

attracting businesses to look towards Limerick as a serious contender in where to locate and

conduct their business.

Looking at the Local Authorities key objectives Councillor Collins was pleased to see a stronger

focus on communities and community support as Chairman of the LCDC, Councillor Collins

see the significance of Communities. The commitment from this authority to engage and

advise communities of grants availability along with other supports is welcome.

The ongoing work in relation to dereliction in our towns and villages is starting to make an

impact and further National legislation and supports into dereliction would be of help.

Properties both commercial and domestic that are left idle should be heavily penalised with

higher rates and property tax and the principle of use it or lose it should apply.

The renewed focus on tourism by this Local Authority is greatly welcome. Limerick has a huge

tourism offering stretching from the heart of this city to the remotest parts of our County.

The ongoing commitment to the great southern greenway is one of the most exciting and

adventurous projects this authority can promote. This will take significant funding and is

disappointed that the Greenway project was overlooked recent by Government from the

rural regeneration and development fund. In fact Limerick received no funding from

Government announcement last week. The delivery of an arts and culture programme for

our authority continues to be a challenge. Again it’s important to get the balance between

City and County right and further investment into arts and culture in the County and in

particular the County town of Newcastle West is a priority of Councillor Collins.

Councillor Collins confirmed that in July of next year Newcastlewest will host Fleadh an

Mumhan, The Munster Fleadh. This will be a showcase of our Irish culture of Music, song and

dance, something Councillor Collins has dedicated a huge amount of his life to and thanked

this authority for the financial support and look forward to further marketing and

promotional support in the months ahead. Councillor Collins referred to the huge positive

commercial value to the town and the greater West Limerick area which may be the

springboard for Limerick securing Fleadh Cheoil na hEireann, The All Ireland Fleadh in the not

too distant future.

The ongoing challenge in our housing directorate is an area that needs further work. It’s a

huge task to manage our housing stock coupled with the need for increased provision in.

Councillor Collins thanked Director Housing Development and her staff for the dedication and

commitment to this area which in my estimation is one of the most challenging areas of this

authority. It’s very easy for members to be critical of aspects of this directorate but we can’t---

forget that we are often hamstrung by National Policy and lack of funding. Vacant properties,

housing maintenance and the Delivering of the Rebuilding Ireland programme must remain a

high focus area for the year ahead.

Councillor Collins referred to the further investment that is needed in our rural towns and

villages. Further funding is needed from Central Government to allow the Council purchase

more properties that are lying idle in villages in particular which will help two fold, it will deal

with dereliction but provide much needed housing for local families crying out for

accommodation.

Councillor Collins stated that as an Authority we are highly progressive… As a City & County

we are open for business and highly competitive to do that. Since the budget briefing he has

been studying this draft document and asking what's in it for the people he represents. In

Fianna Fáil, we support the economic development of Limerick through effective marketing

and positioning of Limerick as a great place to visit and to do business. Councillor Collins looks

forward to the launch of the rebranding of Limerick and the focus of increased economic

investment and the creation of further jobs. He would like to see greater focus on attracting

and creating jobs in the County and asked for a special focus on this in the months ahead and

welcome any new ideas from Management.

Councillor Collins welcomed the renewed commitment to Innovate Limerick and the Local

Enterprise Office. LEO is of huge significance to small and medium size businesses and is often

the 1st port of call for someone with an idea for a business. Our commitment to Smarter Cities

is important and Councillor Collins was fortunate to attend the Smarter Cities Expo this time

last year in Barcelona and acknowledged Dr Mihai Bilauca as Head of Digital Strategy. Again

European funding is an area that needs greater focus which he discussed with the Deputy

Chief Executive during the week and the whole area of grants and funding would warrant a

dedicated and full time team sourcing and accessing these funds.

Councillor Collins was delighted that Commercial rates will be untouched this year as rate

payers contribute significantly to the commercial fabric of life in Limerick. They provide much

needed employment and have had their share of struggles in the past 10 years. We must

continue to support them and this is currently being done through the various support

schemes such as the business & retail incentive scheme, vacant property scheme and of

course the very successful small & medium business support scheme.

Councillor Collins welcomed the ambition of management to deliver on many projects too

numerous to outline individually and mentioned the Newcastle West Regional Athletics Hub.

he thanked the Councils commitment to date but wanted to highlight the lack of commitment

at National level. This is a project that has being going on for over 5 years with a small

committed working committee and the Council colleagues in NCW have been hugely

supportive. This is a facility that has to be delivered on sooner rather than later by this

authority. We have athletes performing at National and International level such as Sophie

Meredith from Newcastle West. These athletes have no facilities in the County and are

depending solely on an already busy sports arena at Plassey. To grow athletics in the County

we need this project delivered on and Councillor Collins requested that the Chief Executive

and his management team to identify funding sources with ping our resources.---

Councillor Collins referred to the emails received emails in the past few days in relation to

mental health and referred to the Prime Time programme which stated that Limerick has one

of the highest rates of suicide and self harm. Councillor Collins supported any group who

highlight anomalies and issues in our mental health system. Councillor Collins requested that

the Mayor to facilitate a cross party delegation led by the Mayor and representatives to meet

the Minister for Health along with support from all Oireachtas Members in Limerick City &

County. Councillor Collins (M) formally seconded the proposal to adopt the budget as

presented.

On behalf of Sinn Fein, Councillor Benson acknowledged that the budget is an improvement

on 2019 however, it completely fails to tackle many issues affecting the people of Limerick

such as the housing crisis. Councillor Benson confirmed that Sinn Fein will be proposing an

alternative that will address the current housing crisis, help those most vulnerable in our

society, and protect Small and Medium Enterprises by proposing a series of amendments

that will ensure the protection of local businesses, local jobs, local investment, and address

the severe lack of local authority housing across the city and county. Councillor Benson

confirmed that Sinn Fein propose to end the Tourism Support Scheme, which is designed to

ensure that Limerick’s largest hotels continue to contribute as little as possible to the local

authority. Sinn Féin proposes to phase out the upper bands of Limerick’s Vacant Property

Scheme, this year reducing the reduction for vacant sites with a rates value of €11,377 to

€57,024 from 25% to 15%. Sinn Fein propose to leave the lowest two bands, any vacant

site with a rates value of less than €11,376 untouched for 2020. Sinn Féin proposes to

expand the bin waver scheme in Limerick, bringing back eligibility for qualification for

people on Invalidity Pension and people on Blind Pension and receive an allocation of

€70,000.

Sinn Féin proposes action to tackle the number of vacant properties owned by this local

authority by allocating the remaining €525,678, towards opening voids. By taking a bottom

up approach to opening voids, starting with the lowest costing projects and working

upwards, it is estimated that more than 50 houses will be opened up to people on the local

authority’s housing list, ensuring that 50 families will have a place called home this coming

year.

Councillor Benson stated that the Sinn Féin amendments will raise revenue through a 1%

rates increase bringing in €585,678, a reduction of the two top bands of the Vacant Property

Scheme raising €40,000, and scrapping the rates reductions for big hotels raising €50,0000

for the people of Limerick. This will be spent as follows; €70,000 to include people on

Invalidity Pension and Blind Pension on the local authority’s bin waver scheme, €80,000 to

protect our SMEs from any rates increase, and €525,678 to re-open our local authority

homes for local families. Councillor Benson thanked the finance team for their assistance

during the budget process.

Councillor Benson’s proposed amendments were circulated to all Members for

consideration.---

On behalf of the Green Party, Councillor Leddin (B) referred to the positive budget that was

presented to Members and referred to the importance of changing society to ensure that

we are all working to tackle the issues affecting our climate. However, Councillor Leddin

referred to the travel and settlement patterns provided for in the budget, which have led to

the crisis of climate change and emphasised the importance of making changes to transform

our society in a way where we don't impact on the mobility or quality of life of our citizens.

On behalf of the Social Democrats, Councillor O’Donovan thanked the finance team for their

assistance during the budget process. Councillor O’Donovan referred to the non payroll

element of the Corporate Affairs and referred to the various costs within this division. She

also referred to the costs associated with the local elections and plebiscite held in May.

Councillor O’Donovan referred to the spend on public conveniences and suggested

exploring the possibility of revenue from these services through advertising. Councillor

O’Donovan also referred to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and emphasised the

importance of aligning our budget with these goals.

On behalf of the Labour Party, Councillor Leddin (J) acknowledged the increased budget that

was presented to Members and the public services provided within each divisions.

Councillor Leddin welcomed the increased spending in housing maintenance and the loan of

€15m to upgrade the existing housing stock. As Chairperson of the Travel & Transportation

SPC, Councillor Leddin welcomed the increased spending in Roads, however referred to the

provision of cycling infrastructure and a review of the terminology used within the Budget

template. Councillor Leddin referred to the Limerick 2030 Plan and the progress being

made on the key strategic sites. He referred to the importance of the Georgian Quarter and

resources to be put in place to promote and further enhance the area.

Councillor Leddin referred to the reduction of Bring Centres and also sought efficiencies in

the provision of street cleaning. Councillor Leddin also acknowledged the reduction in the

cost of Horse Control for 2020. He also emphasised the importance of public amenities and

in particular referred to Caledonian Park on Hyde Road to be redeveloped as a facility to

include soccer pitches, running tracks, and playground activities.

On behalf of the non party Members, Councillor Teefy acknowledged the work of the

Finance team in the preparation of the budget. She also acknowledged the work completed

by the previous council and referred to the Opera site and other key sites being progressed

through Limerick 2030. Councillor Teefy referred to the provision of additional outdoor

staff working within the Roads team and the significant areas to be covered. She referred to

the cost of insurance and the need to reduce this cost. Councillor Teefy emphasised the

demand for social housing in the County towns and villages and the need for the

construction of social housing in these areas. She also referred the need for additional

resources within estate management.---

intervenes to stop the closure and to save Lyric FM. Councillor Sheehan also requested that

them to oppose the proposal. Councillor Sheehan also requested that the Council write to

Ms Dee Forbes, Director General, RTE to ask her to publish the report outlining the rationale

for this proposal and to publish the minutes of the RTE board meeting when this decision

was made. This proposal was seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan.

In supporting these proposals, Members referred to the important cultural contribution

made by Lyric FM and the significance of this decision by RTE and the urgent need to

reverse this decision of relocating Lyric FM to Dublin & Cork. Members discussed the

impact of this decision on staff and the livelihoods of the staff who have families in Limerick.

Members referred to the establishment of the Lyric FM studio in Limerick given the close

proximity to the University, access to the University Concert Hall and the rich cultural

heritage associated with Limerick. It was proposed by Councillor Collins (B), seconded by

Councillor Collins (J)requesting RTE to delay their decision to relocate Lyric FM from

Limerick.

Members expressed frustration and disappointment that no alternative solution had been

identified and the only option available was to relocate the studio to Dublin & Cork.

Members requested transparency and accountability in relation to RTE’s decision to

relocate the studio to Dublin & Cork.

Members acknowledged the concert, which was held to show support for the reversal of the

decision by RTE and referred to the large group of cultural groups that were in attendance.

It was proposed by Councillor Scanlan to amend Councillor Sheehan’s motion to include a

meeting request with the Minister and that Limerick City and County Council examine

property solution options. This amendment was agreed by Councillor Sheehan.

The Mayor thanked Members for their contribution and informed Members that he will be

meeting with the Managing Director, Lyric FM on Monday and he will raise the issues

highlighted by the Members. He also confirmed that the actions outlined in the meeting

would be addressed and Members will be kept updated on the actions.

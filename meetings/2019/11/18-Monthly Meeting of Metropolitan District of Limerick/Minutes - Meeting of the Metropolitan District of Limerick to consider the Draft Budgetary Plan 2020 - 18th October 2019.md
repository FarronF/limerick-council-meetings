categories which total €303,000 per annum into D05 Tourism Development Recreation and Amenity

Director of Services, Support Services suggested that over the 5 year period of the current council,

a fund of €1.5m would be created. This could then be divided between the three Electoral Areas

with each allocated €500,000 to deliver three Strategic Projects and the monies to be ringfenced in

the capital account. In this regard, Director of Services confirmed that if this proposal for 3 strategic

projects proceeds he is willing to front load the 5 year allocation and commit to seeking match

funding with the relevant Director of Service.

Following further discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Sheahan

(M), to take a five minute adjournment.

Upon resumption, it was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (M), seconded by Councillor Costelloe, to

group the following three categories into Division D05 Tourism Development Recreation & Amenity

and each electoral area to decide at the local operational briefings on how the monies are spent.

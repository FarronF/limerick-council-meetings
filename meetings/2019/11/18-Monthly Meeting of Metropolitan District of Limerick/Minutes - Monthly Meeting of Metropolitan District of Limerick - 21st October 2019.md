of high demand or suitable for the social housing model. Members were informed that full analysis

**QUESTIONS**

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council for an update on***

***the progress for the proposed Corbally Nature Park given that €15000 was allocated from the***

***GMA during the term of the previous Council.***

relevant group/project promoter to receive an update on this project. A progress
---

report will be circulated to the Elected Members of the Metropolitan District after

this meeting has taken place.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council for a list of the***

***electric vehicle charging points within the Metropolitan area.***

**REPLY**:  There are a total of 11 points for electric vehicles located within the Metropolitan

Area on public streets.

These are at Bishops Quay, Lower Bedford Row, Carr Street, Merchant’s Quay and

Pery Square.

Details in relation to these sites are available on Limerick E-Parking.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council what progress***

***the Council has made in sourcing additional land at the Park Depot site where the former Park***

***Road Recycling Centre was located, given it had been agreed at the July Special Meeting, that***

***the Council would look to acquire additional land to allow the centre to re-open.***

**REPLY**:  The recycling facilities at the Park Road Depot were closed on the grounds of health

and safety. This matter was discussed at a Special Meeting of the Metropolitan

District held on 20 June, 2019.

In the course of the presentation given at this meeting it was explained to members

that the limited site at Park Road meant that Health and Safety requirements which

are essential for the operation of recycling centres could not be met at Park Road.

Further, an increase in the area of the depot within the ownership of the Council will

not meet Health and Safety requirements, and this was explained to members.

It was also explained to members at that time that any alternative location had to

meet the requirement of ensuring correct segregation. Staff of the Council

examined the possibility of alternative locations, and this was also explained to

members at this time. Indeed, it was the lack of an available site within the area

that led to the provision of the recycling centre within the Park Road site at the

outset, some twenty years before.

The provision of an alternative recycling centre will require land and significant

capital investment which must be funded from the Council’s own resources. Given

that 99% of the users of Park Road arrived by car, the Dock Road site is readily

available to such users.

***With a view to retaining Limerick City’s purple flag, I will ask at the next meeting, has the Council***

City and County Council, Limerick Chamber of Commerce and the Gardaí work in

partnership together to retain the Purple Flag status.

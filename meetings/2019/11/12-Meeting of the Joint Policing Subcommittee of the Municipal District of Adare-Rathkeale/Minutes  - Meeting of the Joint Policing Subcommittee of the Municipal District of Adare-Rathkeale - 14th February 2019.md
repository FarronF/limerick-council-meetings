LL Policing Christmas 2018 — Rathkeale

At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Deasy to the Meeting.

Members proceeded to discuss the CCTV operation in Rathkeale. They felt the current
CCTV was not fit for purpose as accessing data appeared to be cumbersome and were of
the opinion that the viewing of data should be available in the District. While Members
welcomed the operation of CCTV in towns in the District they felt an app should also be
developed for Gardai which would save time in the event of an active crime.

The Head of Digital Strategy informed Members for Gardai to access live CCTV footage a
discussion would have to take place at a National level due to data protection and
legislation. Gardai in the District are facilitated to view CCTV footage when required.
However, the downloading of CCTV footage for investigation purposes requires a strict
formal process which includes a request signed off by a member of An Garda Siochana no
less than a Superintendent. Identification of a Garda number is required before footage
can be downloaded to an encrypted device.

In response to queries from Members, Superintendent Deasy advised Members the
Gardai are very happy with the access to and effectiveness of the CCTV in the District.
CCTV can be viewed quickly and easily for live investigations. With regard to the
monitoring of the system in individual Garda Stations, the Superintendent believes it is
more effective for the CCTV to be monitored in one place. He noted the Gardai also get
great assistance from dash cams, private CCTV footage and also members of the public.

Discussion took place in relation to the policing plan for the Adare-Rathkeale District over
the Christmas period. Members complimented the Superintedent and his staff for the
excellent policing of the District over the season. While some residents of the town of

Rathkeale had complained of over policing due to checkpoints etc. it was agreed that the
District experienced a relatively crime free Christmas season as a result of this policing
plan, The Superintendent advised the biggest issue in the town of Rathkeale for the
festive period was littering and the sale of cheap alcohol.

Member felt there could never be enough policing with more resources required in the
future for rural areas along with the return of Gardai on the beat in the areas, who are
familiar with people in the community. Disappointment was expressed with Tusla
however for not engaging with the youths of the District who have no parental control
exercised.

The Superintendent acknowledged Rathkeale as unique during the Christmas period due
to the increase of engagement parties and wedding parties. While they increased a Garda
presence to maintain a degree of control this did not affect other areas in the District.
There were various checkpoints in the town which resulted in six arrests for drink driving
and drug offences. There were also fifteen cars seized for offences including criminal
activity and theft. Prior to Christmas the Gardai met with local schools and Fordige and a
youth café was open week days to cater for children from eight years plus. The uptake
for the youth café was significantly high with two sittings facilitated to cater for the
increased numbers. There was also great cooperation from licenced premises around the
town and only one serious incident was reported, which occurred on Christmas night.
There was also a number of domestic situations which Gardai dealt with efficiently and a
number of searches under the Criminal Justice Act which were also very successful. Drugs
were also ceased in the town of Rathkeale as well as many other areas in the District. The
Superintendent complimented the multi-agency cooperation which worked well over the
Christmas period.

The Cathaoirleach requested if there could be an improvement on litter law enforcement
incorporated into the 2019 Christmas policing plan. He also wished Sergeant Flood well
in his promotion and enquired if the position of Sergeant in Rathkeale would be vacant
for long. The Superintendent advised Members there is a lot of interest in the position,
therefore, it would be filled in the near future.

Members thanked the Superintendent and Head of Digital Strategy for their attendance
and contribution to the Meeting.

This concluded the Meeting.

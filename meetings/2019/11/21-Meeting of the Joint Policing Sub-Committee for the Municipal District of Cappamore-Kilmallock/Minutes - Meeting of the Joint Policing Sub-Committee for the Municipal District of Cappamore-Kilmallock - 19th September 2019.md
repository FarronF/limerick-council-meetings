Superintendent Ryan confirmed that Garda Jim Ryan from the Bruff Garda Station had retired
recently, and the Superintendent advised that he had sought more resources to support the
operations of An Garda Siochana in the District. The Elected Members welcomed this and
referred to the fact that the Garda Station in Doon was currently vacant and that the Garda
Station in Oola needed additional supports if possible, and Superintendent Ryan agreed to
look at this issue.

Superintendent Ryan also confirmed that An Garda Siochana was planning to run an event in
the Cappamore-Pallasgreen area on rural security, crime prevention and well-being, which
would be similar to an event organised recently in Bruff by An Garda Siochana. The Elected
Members welcomed this initiative and agreed to support the promotion of it.

Superintendent Ryan also referenced the Community Garda Policing Policy, which would
interact with local Schools and Clubs, Text Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Groups and
stressed that every Garda had a role to play as a Community Garda when interacting with
members of the public. He also stressed the importance of supporting the Text Alert groups
across the District and the importance of using social media as a tool in dealing with crime
prevention as well. The Elected Members welcomed this and acknowledged the work done
by Garda Yvonne Norris in Galbally, and other members of An Garda Siochana in the whole
area of community policing.

The Elected Members referred to the issue of the control of horses and sulky use in the
District. They stressed the importance that relevant legislation, such as The Control of Horses
Act 1996, was adhered to by horse owners to ensure the wider public safety for all road users
and pedestrians. Superintendent Ryan agreed to look into any individual cases that the
Elected Members were aware of, and stated that this issue had also to be dealt with in co-
ordination with the local authority and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The Members also referred to the ongoing issue in relation to the speed of traffic, especially
in towns and villages in the Municipal District area, and the ongoing importance of
enforcement measures being taken by An Garda Siochana, in conjunction with road
engineering measures such as the provision of speed ramps and traffic signs, provided by the
local authority.

Superintendent Ryan also highlighted the importance of giving drugs talks in schools by An
Garda Siochana to raise awareness of the dangers of drugs to try to change the culture and
attitudes in society towards drugs as it was such a big issue facing society, and the Elected
Members welcomed this initiative

This concluded the business of the meeting.

Cathaoirleach

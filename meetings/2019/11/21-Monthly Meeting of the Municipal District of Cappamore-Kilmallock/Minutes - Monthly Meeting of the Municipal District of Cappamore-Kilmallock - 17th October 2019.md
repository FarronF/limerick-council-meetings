1. Amend Objective H3 Special Control Area as follows:

It is the objective of the Council not to permit development in the Special Control Area (SCA)
other than leisure/tourism development, which complements the use of the town walls, and
the historical buildings and the natural amenities located within these zones, such as the
completion of the orbital walkway to the east of the town, and a playing pitch for Coldiste
lésaef. Amenities defined in the Public Realm Plan such as walkways along the town walls
will generally be permitted.

This zoning recognises the importance of recorded monuments, including the town defences
and the Dominican Priory. The designated area will be protected from development in order
to maintain the archaeological heritage of the site in the interest of protecting views of these
national monuments, other than leisure/tourism development, which complements the use
of the town walls, and the historical buildings and the natural amenities located within these
zones and outline the area in hatched shading on the Kilmallock Zoning Map Kil-19/25-01.

affecting the taking in charge process.

The allocation of Council housing is governed by the adopted 2017 Allocation Scheme,
which was drafted in accordance with the provisions of Section 22 of the Housing

Social Housing (Amendment) Regulations 2016.

constraints of the Allocation Scheme and statutory requirements, the Council strives to
ensure that a balanced and reasonable approach is taken in making decisions on individual
tenancies.

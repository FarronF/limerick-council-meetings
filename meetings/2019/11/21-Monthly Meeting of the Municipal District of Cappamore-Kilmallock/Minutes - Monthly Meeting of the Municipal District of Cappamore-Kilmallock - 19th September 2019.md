Municipal District in order to improve road safety and reduce risks to road users and
emergency/council personnel on the roads in the Municipal District.

road junction locations that are identified as requiring hedge cutting in order to
improve sightlines and visibility.

However, the current budget of €55,000 approx. for hedge cutting within the Municipal
District does not allow for a planned programme of hedge cutting along road verges
across the Municipal District.

Under Section 70(2) of the Roads Act 1993, the owner or occupier of land is also obliged
to take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on
the land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road, and that it
does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of a
public road.

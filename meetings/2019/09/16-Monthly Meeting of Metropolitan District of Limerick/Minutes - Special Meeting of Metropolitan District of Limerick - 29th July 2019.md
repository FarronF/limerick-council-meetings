particulars. Proper public consultation with 3D modelling of project should have been

provided.

 Concerns with respect to the Strategic Housing Development process and preference for the

development to be dealt with by the Planning Authority first.

 The height of the structure is excessive with regard to existing housing stock.

at junction of Rosbrien Roads. The addition of a third lane is unsuitable. Questions over the

validity of traffic and transport assessment.

 The proposed development should offer a greater social mix.

 The applicant should provide a greater degree of cycle lanes around the site.

car parking.

 Condition should attach to an onsite 24/7 security and point of contact to be provided.

 A construction management plan should be provided.

 The onsite management of the site is critical to its success.

 The pallet of material and finishes should be long lasting and weather appropriately.

 Concerns with respect to previous uses of petrol station and quarry.

 No assessment submitted with regard to the risks of contamination as a result of old petrol

station and quarry.

 Not enough mix of type of residential development offered on site.

 Concerns regarding potential excessive noise during construction phase. Protection of

vulnerable neighbouring use, HSE residents.

 All landscaping should consist of planting of native species internally.

 Increased levels of cycle facilities should be provided for within the site and surrounding space.

In response to Members queries regarding the next steps in the planning process, the A/Senior

Planner confirmed that a summary of the views of the Elected Members on the proposed

**QUESTIONS**

**4.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask the Council to confirm what action is currently being taken on poor parking practices***

***throughout the city including parking on footpaths and parking at bus stops and to present a***

***report on this matter.***

**REPLY:**

It is an offence to park a vehicle on a footpath. Where the traffic wardens

encounter a vehicle parked on a footpath, it is issued with a fine immediately.

Since January 2019, a total of 490 tickets have been issued for this offence.

It is also an offence to park in a bus stop. Where the traffic warden encounters an

illegally parked vehicle it is immediately issued with a fine. In addition the Council

has introduced colour coded macadam to more clearly identify bus stops in the

core business district and improve public transport. Since January 2019, a total of

310 fines have been issued by the Council for this offence to date.

On a more general issue of poor parking practices, the Council's Traffic

Wardens issue fines for parking on double yellow lines, pedestrian crossings

and parking within 5 metres of a junction.

It is important to note that An Garda Síochána are very active in relation to all the

above offences and work collaboratively with the Council on enforcement.

**5.**

**Question submitted by** **Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask the Council what actions are being taken to address littering and dog fouling across***

***the city and to clarify if more public bins will be installed to address these issues.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council has a co-ordinated approach to implementing the

various provisions of the Litter Pollution Act / Waste Management Acts and the---
4

Waste Presentation Bye Laws. It involves the Domestic Waste & Litter, Street

Cleaning, Community Support, Environmental Awareness Teams, together with the

Area Offices and other stakeholders including Community / Tidy Towns Groups /

Residents’ Associations and businesses

At an operational level, the Council continues to address the ongoing challenges

of:

casual littering / indiscriminate deposit of household rubbish, dog fouling, the lack

of evidence recovered, the operations of unpermitted waste collectors and

increasing the number of households availing of approved refuse collection

arrangements.

To date in 2019 enforcement activity has included:

 1,910 domestic waste & litter inspections

 Issuing of 264 on-the-spot fines, including 8 dog fouling fines.

 680 domestic waste & litter cases/complaints resolved.

 40 cases referred for legal proceedings in respect of littering / dog fouling

offences.

 The Council has also arranged for the clean-up of five severely littered sites in

the City / County under the 2019 Anti-Dumping Initiative and will be overseeing

similar works in other sites in its jurisdiction in the coming weeks.

 Dog Fouling awareness campaign on local radio/cinema in early 2019. The

campaign will be re-run at a later date.

The Council are undertaking a review of existing litter bins in the City. It is our

experience that a number of bins in the city centre are being used for illegal

dumping. The review will identify these locations and the Council will remove these

bins and relocate to a more suitable location in the Core Business District and

places of greatest footfall.

**6.**

**Question submitted by** **Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council to consider the introduction of relevant bye-laws in***

***collaboration with An Garda Síochána to prevent the use of scrambler bikes on public footpaths***

***or privately owned lands.***

**REPLY:**

The relevant legislation relating to the regulation of vehicles using public footpaths

is the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, which are given effect by

Section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. Article 13 of the regulations provides that

“a vehicle shall not be driven along or across a footway.” Section 35 (5) of the Road

Traffic Act 1994 makes it an offence to contravene a regulation. It is a matter for

An Garda Síochána, as the Traffic Authority, to enforce the regulations in this

instance.

Section 199 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, confers the power on

local authorities to make bye-laws for or in relation to the use, operation,

protection, regulation or management of any land, services or other such matter

provided by or **under the control or management** of the local authority. In that

context the Council has included bye-laws regulating the use of vehicles (including---
5

motorcycles) in its existing Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws. However, the Council

does not have the power to regulate the use of private land via bye-laws.

**7.**

**Question submitted by** **Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will ask at the next meeting that the footpath going down the Church Road, Patrickswell be***

***extended across Newboro and back toward Collopys Cross as this area constantly has***

***pedestrians on it which is quite dangerous with oncoming traffic.***

**REPLY:**

The proposed location requested is in a rural setting. It is a policy of the Council to

maintain existing footpaths within the city, towns and villages of Limerick.

Members will be aware that there is very extensive network of roads and footpaths

in Limerick and these are subject to significant wear and tear. Regrettably, there is

also a high rate of claims against the Council for slips, trips and falls on this network

and this is reflected in the high cost of public liability insurance costs, which the

Council must pay every year. In recent years the Council has invested considerable

resources in the repair and maintenance of existing footpaths to mitigate the risk

to users. However, it is also the case that there has been serious underinvestment

in this service area for many years.

Having regard to the details set out above, it is not possible, regrettably to accede

to requests to extend footpaths in non-built up / rural areas, as the focus of the

Council is on maintaining the existing public realm within the resources available

to it.

**9.**

**Question submitted by** **Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting whether the Council have made contact with the Department of***

***Housing in relation to a cost rental scheme.***

**REPLY:**

Given the affordability challenge faced by the rental sector in Limerick and other

parts of the country, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government

(DHPLG) is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in

Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost

rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the

attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.

In order to support local authorities in delivering affordable homes, including cost

rental, €310 million is being made available from 2019 until 2021 under the

Serviced Site Fund (SSF). The SSF will fund facilitating infrastructure, on local

authority sites, for the provision of affordable housing including cost rental. At a

funding rate of €50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 will be facilitated in

total.

In May 2019, the Housing Development Directorate of Limerick City and County

Council prepared masterplans and cost plans for a competitive bid application

under the Serviced Sites Fund for 7 key sites in the City and County to deliver

affordable housing including cost-rental. We are awaiting a decision on these

applications from the DHPLG in the coming weeks and will notify the Elected

Members of the outcome.

**10.**

**Question submitted by** **Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update and a detailed outline of the Councils planned***

***housing maintenance for vacant houses in the Metropolitan area.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council has committed to removing the current batch of

Voids by June 2020, understanding that the return of properties, for various

reasons, takes place on an on-going basis throughout the City and County.

To manage the issue, we have introduced a fast-track process that will see a pilot

project being launched to return more of the properties in batches of 30.

The project will include a mix of properties from City and County areas.

The pilot will be completed in conjunction with the existing work programme of

Operations and Maintenance and Design and Delivery, who look after the

properties approved for Voids funding and properties approved under the Buy and

Renew Scheme.

We are introducing a single point of contact to assess the returned property

immediately. This will ensure that the vacated property enters a work stream

based on a standard scope and timeframe, which is determined by an inspection

of the property at the outset.---

The above measures will be reviewed on a monthly basis to assess progress made

with regular reporting on same to be included in our report to Council.

**11.**

**Question submitted by** **Councillor J. Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for:***

***(a) a detailed listing of HAP payments by Limerick City and County Council to renters in the***

***Limerick Metropolitan Area since its introduction in March 2017. The detailed listing to show:***

***\*total HAP payments in quarters, beginning April 2017, through to June 2019.***

***\*total number of HAP recipients for each of the above quarters.***

***\*the total number of properties covered under the HAP payments per quarter, with the***

***properties identified by region, i.e.*** ***X HAP recipients received €Y relating to Z properties in***

***Limerick City North/Limerick City East/Limerick City West.***

***(b)(i) A breakdown by quarter beginning April 2017, through to June 2019, and by metropolitan***

***region - city north, city east, city west - of how many HAP renters have to make top up***

***payments, in addition to the HAP payment, to meet the full monthly rent being charged by the***

***landlord.***

***(ii) If the information in B(i) is available, a breakdown by quarter and city region of how what***

***percentage of the monthly private rent is made up of top up payments/HAP payments.***

**REPLY:**

The question outlined above will require a further period of time to prepare as it is

a significant request and Housing Support Services do not have this level of

financial data available locally. This is due to payments being processed via the

HAP Shared Services Centre. HSS Centre have agreed to support our request but

have indicated that it will take a number of weeks to prepare due to data required.

In the absence of the requested data, please see available data.

Currently Limerick City and County Council have 2,264 active Limerick HAP

Tenancies that we monitor, review and maintain.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council identify and include potential***

***suitable park and ride sites to facilitate those who wish to travel by alternative means as part***

***of the Limerick Transport Strategy currently being prepared.***

In proposing the Motion, Cllr Leddin referred to the need for a potential suitable park and ride

sites to be identified in order for the public to travel by alternative modes of transport. This

Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and agreed.

**REPLY**:

The National Transport Authority (NTA), in partnership with Limerick City and

County Council (LCCC) and Clare County Council (CCC), has commenced work to

develop a new Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (MATS) for the Limerick

Shannon Metropolitan Area.

The LSMATS will set out a series of actions and measures, covering infrastructural,

operational and policy elements to be implemented in the Limerick Shannon

Metropolitan Area over the next 20 years and will outline a framework to deliver

the projects in a phased manner. The Strategy will take account of current and

predicted population, National Planning Framework objectives, national transport

policies, existing plans and strategies in the region and existing transport assets.

As part of the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) all

major trip attractors will be considered. All transport modes will be considered

and in addition, options including park and ride and park and stride bus

connections will be examined.---

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council employ suitably qualified***

***tradespeople who can facilitate the completion of maintenance works in Council owned houses***

***thus reducing the amount of time that houses or apartments are left unoccupied.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin (J) referred to the number of vacant houses owned by

Limerick City and County Council and the maintenance work required by private contractors in

order to get them to a certain standard for reletting. This Motion was seconded by Councillor

Sheehan and agreed. Members requested a report on the vacant houses and for housing officials

to be present at the September meeting. Members expressed concern at delays in repairing

houses and the length of time some of these properties were vacant. Following discussion, the

Director, Service Operations agreed that a report would be prepared and presented to the

Members at the September Monthly Meeting.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I call on the Limerick Metropolitan Councillors to join me in writing to the Minister of State with***

***special responsibility for Local Government and Electoral Reform, to review the use of election***

***posters in the interest of reducing the use of single use plastics while protecting the integrity of***

***the democratic process.***

In proposing the Motion Cllr Butler referred to the need for a review of the use of election posters

and look to other countries on how we can reduce the use of single plastics during the election

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***Lurriga and back the main road at Collopys Cross*** ***to*** ***Ballycurrane. Please note this was in the***

***original sewer line plans for the Patrickswell area but not installed.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor Leddin (J) and agreed.

**Reply:**

Please note below the response received from Irish Water.

Thank you for your recent communication regarding the Metropolitan District

Meeting on Monday 15th July requesting a response to the issues highlighted.

Irish Water wish to advise that the extension of the wastewater network at this

location is currently not on our Capital Investment Plan. The Capital Investment

Plan is currently focused upon Drinking water and Environmental Compliances.

Where a potential customer is seeking an extension of the wastewater

infrastructure, this can be accommodated by a connection agreement where the

applicant becomes the customer and the driver for the extension, thus funding the

sewer extension to meet their needs. A link to the application forms is attached for

your reference, https://www.water.ie/connections/get-connected/---

I trust you find the above information satisfactory. Thank you for contacting Irish

Water.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council make space available at a suitable premises***

***within the Metropolitan area for Limerick City Community Radio for a studio as they have to***

***vacate their building Presentation Court, Sexton Street by the end of July.***

Cllr Sheehan acknowledged the valuable service that Limerick City Community Radio provide to

the community and the need for a suitable premises to be sourced in order for them to continue

broadcasting. The motion was seconded by Councillor Kiely and agreed.

**REPLY:**

In response to the Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan and arising

from the increased number of requests generally to provide facilities or property

for community groups and organisations throughout Limerick, I advise that the

Council decided to conduct an audit of existing facilities. This work has now

commenced in partnership with the local development companies. This audit will

identify the existing provision of facilities across Limerick City and County and

inform a strategy that will seek to ascertain future needs. Limerick City and County

Council already supports a large number of organisations through the lease of

property but it is not possible to accommodate all requests. The audit will also

seek to identify opportunities for groups to share facilities.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council will fund a feasibility study to explore***

***alternative parking methods in support of the staff, patients, and local residents adjacent to***

***Limerick's hospital facilities.***

In proposing the motion Councillor O’Donovan acknowledged the difficulty experienced by the

local residents adjacent to the hospital and the urgent need for this issue to be addressed. This

Motion was seconded by Councillor Leddin (J).

**REPLY**:

It is a matter for the UL Hospital Group to consider the parking requirements for its

staff, visitors and patients within the hospital campus. In recent months 2 hour pay

and display parking has been implemented on Church Road adjacent to Raheen

Church to provide parking for the Dooradoyle area. Additionally, double yellow

lines have been painted in the residential areas around the location of the hospital

to prevent parking at key areas and blocking access for residents.

As part of the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) all

major trip attractors, such as the UL Hospital, will be considered. All transport

modes will be considered and options examined for all such attractors, as in, park

and ride, park and stride bus connection and cycle networks.

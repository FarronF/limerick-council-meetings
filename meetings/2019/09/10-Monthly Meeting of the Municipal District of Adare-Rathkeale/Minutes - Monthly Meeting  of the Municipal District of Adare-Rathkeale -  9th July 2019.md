**French Group Encampment, Rathkeale**

Councillor Sheahan informed Members of his visit to the site of the French Encampment

outside Rathkeale in June with the Housing Executive Engineer. He spoke with the

group leader who had informed him the group were currently travelling across Europe

to preach to Traveller communities and their mission was to discourage excessive

drinking and conflict. Councillor Sheahan concluded saying the group plan a further visit

to Rathkeale in either December 2019 or March 2020.

Councillor Keary advised Members this group had arrived at the Rathkeale Site on the

Saturday morning and there had been no delivery of toilet facilities or waste collection

until the Monday morning. He also believed their arrival raised concern amoung the

local community as they had not made the intention of their visit clear at the time.

Councillor Sheahan informed Members when the group vacated the site it had been left

as it had been found in the first instance and could see no reason why this group should

not be welcomed back in to the area for future visits.

At this point, on the proposal of Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue,

it was agreed to suspend Standing Orders to continue the business of the Meeting.

discussions in relation to GMA should take place in a workshop format.

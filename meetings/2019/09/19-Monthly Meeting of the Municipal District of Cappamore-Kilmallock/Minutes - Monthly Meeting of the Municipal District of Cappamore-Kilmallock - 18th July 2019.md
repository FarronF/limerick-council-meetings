Upgrade to Plant

“Thank you for your email on behalf of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District
regarding Hospital Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)

| have received an update advising that Irish Water has determined that a capital upgrade is
required to achieve the licence ELVs at Hospital WWTP. The assessed capital needs were not
included in the current investment plan.

These needs will be included in the 2020-2024 investment plan prioritisation process, taking
place this year (this process includes stakeholder engagement). It will not formally be known
whether Hospital is selected in the next investment plan until CRU have approved the
investment plan during 2019.

Upgrade to Inlet Works

*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
Please note Hospital will require planning permission, which our consultants are currently
preparing the application for. Hospital forms part of the Waste Water Treatment Plant
Upgrade Contract 2.

A short list questionnaire for WWTPU Contract 2 was sent out to the market and is currently
being evaluated. After the evaluation of the questionnaire, we are hoping to send the
tenders out to market mid-August with contract award in November 2019.

While Hospital will be one of approximately 15 sites in their contract, we have made note of
the requirement to fast track Hospital and have made note of this in the tender documents.
A contractor for Site Investigation is currently being tendered and once dates are confirmed,
we will be in contact with Limerick City & County Council to arrange these works.

Proposed by Cllr Donegan, seconded by Cllr P.J.Carey

Reply: The Kilmallock Roads Office will prepare a design proposal for safety improvements on
this junction with the intention of meeting the respective landowners to see if Dedication
Agreements can be put together for proposed works.

It would be the intention that the proposed junction works would be carried out to a similar
standard to that used at Ballycahill Junction in Hospital in 2018 but these proposed safety
improvements would also be subject to funding being identified to carry out same.

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

| will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that

Questions
8. Question submitted by Councillor Gerald Mitchell

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District what is the
current progress update on the 20 Social Housing Units proposed for construction in
Hospital

Reply: The tender documentation for the proposed development of 20 new social housing
units at Hospital will complete through July 2019. Irish Water have intention to undertake
some minor improvement works, through the course of 2020, at the municipal wastewater
treatment plant. These works will release capacity for 15 additional housing units to be
connected to the public wastewater disposal network. The Local Authority has made an
application to Irish Water seeking to take advantage of any such available capacity within
the public wastewater network. In this regard, the proposed housing development is
intended to be advanced via a dual wastewater disposal strategy with part of the
development being serviced by the public wastewater network and the balance being
serviced by an on-site wastewater treatment plant (pending further Irish Water
improvements at the Municipal plant). The process for procurement of a works contractor is
intended to be commenced in August 2019 with the objective of a construction contract
being signed in Q4/2019. Units are anticipated to complete in Q4/2020.

9. Question submitted by Councillor Gerald Mitchell

| will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District as to why it
takes so long to retrofit vacant Council houses having regard to current pressures on the
Council’s Waiting List.

Reply: We have committed to removing the current batch of Voids by June 2020,
understanding that the return of properties, for various reasons, takes place on an on-going
basis throughout the City and County.

Up to now, the timeframe for return of properties includes a Voids funding application to
the Department in advance, with works commencing upon receipt of approval.


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
To manage the issue, we are in the process of introducing a fast-track process that will see a
pilot project being launched to return 30 of the properties in the coming months, After the
first phase is completed, we will move to return more of the properties in batches of 30.

The project will include a mix of properties from City and County areas.

The pilot will be completed in conjunction with the existing work programme of Operations
and Maintenance and Design and Delivery, who look after the properties approved for Voids
funding and properties approved under the Buy and Renew Scheme.

We are introducing a single point of contact to assess the returned property immediately.
This will ensure that the vacated property enters a work stream based on a standard scope
and timeframe, which is determined by an inspection of the property at the outset.

The above measures will be reviewed on a monthly basis to assess progress made with
regular reporting on it to be included in our report to Council.

10. Question submitted by Councillor Michael Donegan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update on the Smart CCTV and ask when is the information evening with the communities
taking place.

Reply: Based on the findings of the Limerick Hinterland Study Report 2015 which
highlighted the lack of infrastructure and indicated the crime levels across 14 towns, LCCC
developed in 2016 a proposal to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and

Local Government (DoHPCLG) for the installation of integrated “Smart CCTV” infrastructure:
that will see 14 local communities taking full advantage of the advances in CCTV
technologies in the fight against rural crime, disorder and anti-social activity and increase
community involvement to prevent and reduce crime in local areas working together with
all local agencies, community councils, the Council, An Garda and the JPC. While each
community benefits from a local smart CCTV system, all 14 systems will be connected to a
central CCTV Monitoring Centre who will also provide one point of contact for Garda
officers and assistance for fault detection, maintenance and data backup.

The DoHPCLG approved this proposal and provided €250,000 in funding subject to match
funding to be provided by the Council. The Council approved the match funding of €250,000
to be provided for the installation of CCTV.

Due to budget limitations, the projected demand for CCTV installation in the 14 towns has
been met by installation in two waves.


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
Wave i
Currently the Smart CCTV project Wave 1 is in transition (test) status.

Wave 1 CCTV installations are completed in all 14 towns with all 14 systems recording live
footage. During this transition period, An Garda Siochana officers are provided with the
CCTV footage needed for the purpose of securing public order and safety in public places by
facilitating the deterrence, prevention, detection and prosecution of offences.

In Wave 1, 48 High Spec / High Quality cameras (or the equivalent of at least 88 cameras)
have been installed in 23 new locations in the 14 towns, as follows:

* 11x 360' Panoramic PTZ cameras

* 9x 270' Panoramic PTZ cameras

* 3x 180' Panoramic PTZ cameras

* 18x ANPR cameras for number plate recognition

* 7x PTZ cameras for Active Monitoring (Live Streaming)

The project consisted of the following milestones.

* 2017 May — Draft CCTV Locations

* 2017 July — Public Consultations: 4 municipal districts; 55 representatives from 28
community organisations and 14 towns

* 2017 August — Tender published

* 2017 November — Contract Signed for Wave 1: 44 cameras in 14 towns, 23 locations,
14 CCTV Hubs, live monitoring in Moyross Community Enterprise Centre

* 2017 December — First 5 cameras are installed in Rathkeale

* 2018 February —Legal Advice in relation to CCTV Policy and Data Protection

* 2018 April — Civil works completed

* 2018 May-— CCTV system in Transition(Test)

* 2018 November — New CCTV monitoring centre opened in Moyross Community
Enterprise Centre.

Costs: €440,000

Note: The project will be maintained in this transition (test) status until any
recommendations in relation to GDPR that will come from the Data Protection
Commissioner audit are fully implemented and until any technical issues are ironed out.

Wave 2

We expect that the demand for CCTV will only increase in time as many other communities
could benefit from CCTV and apply to the Department of Justice (DoJ) for funding from
Community CCTV Scheme. We hope that with the knowledge provided by the CCTV
framework develop during the Smart CCTV project many other communities will succeed in
their applications under the DoJ Community CCTV Scheme.


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
In November 2018, we secured €334,573 in funding from the Community CCTV Scheme of
the Department of Justice for the 14 towns included in the Smart CCTV Project. This allows
us now to complete Wave 2 of the project and also to maintain sufficient funding for the
maintenance and operation of the systems for the next 5 years.

This is the largest amount secured by any organisation for CCTV under the DoJ Community
CCTV Scheme.

Next steps

* implement any DPC Audit Recommendations when available

* Safer Communities Website - including info and a map of all CCTV in Limerick

* Community Consultations — Demo of CCTV Monitoring Centre and DPIA update

* Signage to be deployed on the main roads that enter in the 14 towns to indicate
CCTV in use

* Commence Wave 2—- With funding from DoJ CCTV Scheme

* Develop CCTV Policy — With the Limerick Joint Policing Committee

* Develop a CCTV Strategy — With the Limerick Joint Policing Committee in order to
choose strategic locations and minimize the CCTV sprawl, maximize impact in
fighting crime and offence and minimize costs and impact on privacy.

The public information event in relation to the Smart CCTV project in Kilmallock is
scheduled for 24™ of July.

141. Question submitted by Councillor Michael Donegan

| will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update on the recent visit to Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

Reply: The meeting between Til and a delegation from Limerick City and County Council has
not taken place yet, and arrangements are in train.

Limerick City and County Council have written to TIl with a list of agenda items and a list of
proposed attendees as received from the Municipal Districts. It is expected that the

12. Question submitted by Councillor Martin Ryan

| will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an
update in relation to the insurance requirements for the completion of the skateboard
park in Murroe.

Reply: The Council has facilitated contact between Irish Public Bodies and Murroe Wood
Park CLG in order to resolve the insurance for the skateboard park in Murroe

13. Question submitted by Councillor Martin Ryan

| will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for a
progress update on the roadworks on Main Street, Caherconlish, Co. Limerick.

Reply: The roadworks on the Main Street in Caherconlish will commence on Monday the
22" July 2019 and will entail the closing of a section of the street for a three-week period
until Friday the 16" August 2019.

Due to substructure failure, a full dig out of a section of the existing road is required to a
depth of 400mm to facilitate the reconstruction of sub structure prior to placement of new
macadam layer. Unfortunately, due to existing road widths, these excavation works will not
facilitate single lane traffic operation so therefore there is a requirement for full lane
closure.

Other Matters Arising:

e Appointment of Superintendent

The Members expressed their disappointment that Brian Sugrue, Superintendent for the Bruff
District was being reassigned to the Roxboro Road District in Limerick City. While praising the
work carried out by Supt Sugrue during the short time he was in the District, the Elected
Members agreed that it was very important that a Superintendent was given the time to get
to know a District to ensure that policing resources were fully applied throughout a District.

¢ Delegati om T re Ireland (Til

The Cathaoirleach referred to the proposed meeting with Transport Infrastructure Ireland
(Tit) which is likely to take place in the Autumn. It was agreed to re-circulate the suggested
agenda items from the District, to the Elected Members, in case they wanted to add any other
suggested items for this proposed meeting.

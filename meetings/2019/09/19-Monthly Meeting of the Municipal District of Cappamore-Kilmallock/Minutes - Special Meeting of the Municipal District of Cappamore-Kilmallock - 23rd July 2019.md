Following discussions on completion of the presentation, it was agreed to amend the
Kilmallock Area Plan as follows:-

Material Amendment proposed to the Proposed Kilmallock Local Area Plan 2019 — 2025 by
Councillor Carey and seconded by Councillor E. Ryan as follows:-

Amend Objective H3 Special Control Area text (Page 51) as follows:

It is an objective of the Council not to permit development in the Special Control
Area (SCA) other than leisure/tourism development, which complements the use
of the town walls, and the historical buildings and the natural amenities located
within these zones, such as the completion of the orbital walkway to the east of
the town and a playing pitch for Coldiste lésaef. Amenities defined in the Public
Realm Plan such as walkways along the town walls will generally be permitted.

Amend Special Control Area text (Page 85) as follows:

This zoning recognises the importance of recorded monuments, including the
town defences and the Dominican Priory. The designated area will be protected
from development in order to maintain the archaeological heritage of the site in
the interest of protecting views of these national monuments, other than
leisure/tourism development which complements the use of the town walls, and
the historical buildings and the natural amenities located within these zones.

Amend the Zoning Matrix, Table 9.2, page 88 to include School Playing Pitch as a
category of development, open for consideration on the lands, zoned Special
Control Area, as hatched in red in Submission No. 13, received from the Limerick
Clare Education and Training Board only and outline this area on the Proposed
Kilmallock Zoning Map Kil-19/25-01.

It was further proposed by Councillor M. Ryan that the Draft Plan be made, subject to the
amendments. Councillor Egan seconded this proposal.

The Elected Members thanked the Cathaoirleach and the Executive for their help and
support in preparing the amendments to the Kilmallock Area Plan 2019-2025.

This concluded the business of the meeting.

**Chief Executive Address to Council**

Deputy Mayor paidtribute to Chief Executive, Conn Murray for his tremendous contribution

to life in Limerick since he arrived back in the city and county in 2012 and referred to Limerick

as a different place.

He stated that the Chief Executive faced a city and county that was getting back on its feet

after the economic recession, recovering from challenging social problems and divided, from

an administrative perspective. Deputy Mayor Teskey stated that while we respect your---
2

decision to move on to pastures new and, we wish you well on this new phase of his life, we

do so with heavy hearts. We know you will be recognised as among the key architects of the

incredible economic renaissance that Limerick has undergone over the past number of years.

He referred to the Chief Executives appreciation of the Beatles and quite like the Beatles,

Conn pushed the boundaries. Their sound was different from anything that preceded them.

Like John, Paul, George and Ringo, you shifted the landscape when you came on the scene

and re-invented the landscape around you. One of your greatest challenges has been leading

the amalgamation of the former Limerick City and Limerick County Councils, and with it the

biggest single change-management programme in local government history.

Simultaneously, you put in place the building blocks for an unprecedented economic upturn

that has transformed Limerick’s economic, social and cultural profile.  For our citizens and

those who come here afresh to live and work in the Mid-West, it is in no small part because

of the visionary leadership you have given this city and county at a critical time in its history.

The key statistics from your period in charge speak for themselves. We have, in the past five

years, seen over 15,000 new jobs and €2 billion of planned investment bound for Limerick.

The blueprint for this success has been ‘Limerick 2030: An Economic and Spatial Plan for

Limerick’ - a once in a generation plan you delivered that has steered the recovery of our city

and county, a recovery that has urban centres across the nation and beyond looking on in

envy.

 Initiatives like Limerick Twenty Thirty, backed by the elected members which is

transformative for the city is now well underway with the commencement of the

procurement process for consultants to assist in the latest project, the Cleeves site

 The Regeneration programme and the Housing Development programme in Limerick, has

and continues, to improve communities and address challenges in a way that benefits all

who live, work and invest in Limerick for generations to come.

 The creation of the largest economic unit in any local authority and implementing the

Ireland’s first National City of Culture programme all came under your watch – who can

forget the magnificent sight of Granny and the 200,000 people who came to see her that

wonderful sunny weekend in September 2014

It’s been a remarkable period for the city and county and while we had our challenges, as all

local authorities do, at no stage could we doubt the fact that we had the right person in the

right place at the right time in Limerick. It was a time that we needed courage and creativity

and Conn Murray brought this in abundance.

Cllr Teskey thanked the Chief Executive for all his support and help as a councillor and wished

him well in his future endeavours. Cllr Teskey referred to the strong vision and direction he created

for Limerick City and County Council and helped create the relationships and partnerships that have

been a real strength of his leadership and the resulting collaboration between our stakeholders and

partners. He concluded by with a quote from John Lennon who said

*“Trying to please everybody is impossible –**if you did that, you’d end up in the middle with*

*nobody liking you. You’ve just got to make the decision about what you think is your best, an**d*

*do it.”*---

Cllr Teefy, on behalf of the Non Party Members congratulated the Chief Executive on his

retirement and recalled 5 years ago when the new Council met it was a very historic occasion,

the newly amalgamated Limerick City and County Council. Cllr Teefy referred to the

challenging times that the Chief Executive faced, coming out of recession and the unknown

territory to create a new organisation and structures that now have been acknowledged and

rewarded nationally and internationally. Cllr Teefy acknowledged the important steps that

the Chief Executive took in terms of the renaissance of Limerick, but he also very much led

the remarkable recovery that is underway here. Cllr Teefy referred to the various awards

throughout the last five years due to the leadership and professionalism of the Chief Executive

had worked in previously. Cllr Costelloe acknowledged the infrastructural and social changes

that have occurred in particular in Moyross. Cllr Costelloe thanked the Chief Executive for his

significant contribution.

Chief Executive, Conn Murray thanked Cllr Teskey and the Members for their kind words and

for the opportunity to express his thanks to the Elected Members and spoke of the privilege

of having a career in local government. The Chief Executive recalled returning to Limerick 7

years ago and the huge challenges that both Councils were facing including the merger. He

stated that change does not come easily and change is inevitable but requires leadership and

progress, which the Elected Members have shown consistently. The Chief Executive referred

to the challenges that the Authority faced such as the City of Culture, merger of the 2

Authority’s and return of the Regeneration programme to the local authority balanced with

the economic era and the path that needed to be set to deliver on these challenges. It was

important that all facets of people and stakeholders were included in order to plan, create

alliances and partnerships. The Chief Executive commended the Elected Members on the

decisions made and for trusting the vision and in turn creating the opportunities for Limerick.

The Chief Executive stated that in order to continue that drive and success for Limerick and

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to the

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will ask at the next meeting that the cycle lanes in Limerick city and county be swept***

***once a month to clear broken glass and debris for cyclists.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council carries out extensive street sweeping daily on

many routes across the city and county. As the network of cycle routes

increases and more cyclists avail of same, the Council will continue to monitor

the maintenance of the cycle network. This will include sweeping,

maintenance and repair of same. Where the Council is made aware that a cycle

route needs attention outside of routine maintenance the Council will address

as soon as is possible. Members of the Council and the public are requested to

use Sugar CRM to make us aware of individual cases.

Accordingly as the network of cycle ways increases, the Council will keep the

maintenance of all roads and footpaths under review in the context of

competing demands for services. It is important to understand that where

additional sweeping may be required, this will have resource implications and

will need to be considered in the context of the annual budget. It will also be

open to members to allocate resources under the General Municipal Allocation

for various services, should they wish.

 At no point has funding ever been returned to the Department of Housing, as an Authority

we strive to utilise the maximum funding available at all times.

 The application process can take between 3 to 8 weeks depending on time of year and

volume of applications received at any one time. Funding available also fluctuates from

year to year coupled with the Department of Housing grant approval dates changing each

year which can add time to the overall process.

 For DPG funding, there is currently a very large backlog due to funding limitations

experienced over the past number of years. The 2019 allocation increase is very welcome

and it will significantly improve the backlog. However we must stress the importance of

maintaining this level of funding for the next number of years.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next meeting, the reason why the housing adaptation grants season closes***

***from October to January each year and if there are any plans to review this going forward,***

***to allow for urgent applications to be processed and awarded during this time.***

**REPLY:**

The Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme and Mobility Aid Grant does not close

at any stage during the year. Funding in October would be largely allocated at

this time.

We are not in a position to issue approval letters where we have no funding to

allocate as we strive to manage customer expectations at all times. Doing this

allows us to ensure that all works are completed and that we can submit our

returns to the Department of Housing. Please note that Priority Emergency

Cases will always be addressed.

**12.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a timeframe for the completion of the Limerick Shannon***

***Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy.***---
19

**REPLY:**

The National Transport Authority (NTA), in partnership with Limerick City and

County Council (LCCC) and Clare County Council (CCC), has commenced work

to develop a new Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (MATS) for the

Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area.

The LSMATS will set out a series of actions and measures, covering

infrastructural, operational and policy elements to be implemented in the

Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area over the next 20 years and will outline a

framework to deliver the projects in a phased manner. The strategy will take

account of current and predicted population, National Planning Framework

objectives, national transport policies, existing plans and strategies in the

region and existing transport assets.

Progress to date has included the collation of data in relation to land use

forecasts and demand analysis modelling. Analysis is currently under way and

a Baseline Report is being drafted.

The next step is review of the Baseline Report and the Demand Analysis Report

by LCCC and CCC and feedback to the NTA.

Once the review of baseline and demand analysis is complete, development of

transport options will commence. It is anticipated that stakeholder

consultation will commence in August/September 2019, with a draft of the

Strategy being prepared for public consultation in January, 2020. Following

public consultation the Strategy should be completed by Quarter 2 2020.

**13.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

**I will ask at the next meeting of Limerick City and County Council for an update on Limerick’s**

**Transport Strategy. When is the strategy to be delivered? When will consultation take place**

**with members of the public, other interest groups and local representatives?**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

**I will ask at the next meeting of Limerick City and County Council for details of how many**

**new social housing units, by district, will be delivered in 2019? How many voids, by district,**

**does Limerick Council currently have? What is the average time to return a void house back**

**into use? What measures are planned to reduce this turnaround time?**

**REPLY:**

New Social Housing Units are being delivered uner the following programmes

in 2019:

 CAS Constructon

 SHIP and Regeneration Construction

 Part V

 Part V Community Homes

 SHIP Turnkey

The number of units projected to be delivered under these programmes in

2019 is 109. 92 of these units are in the Metropolitan District, 6 in the

Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District and 11 in the Newcastle West

Municipal District.

The number of voids currently in Limerick City and County Council’s stock are

as follows:

 Limerick Metropolitan District: 64 Major Refurb & 81 Casual Vacancies.

 Adare-Rathkeale District: 2 Major Refurb & 9 Casual Vacancies.

 Newcastle West District: 15 Major Refurb & 24 Casual Vacancies.

 Cappamore-Kilmallock District: 9 Major Refurb & 17 Casual Vacancies.

The average return time for void properties is 28.49 weeks.

We committed to removing the current batch of Voids by June 2020,

understanding that the return of properties, for various reasons, takes place

on an on-going basis.---
21

To manage the issue we have introduced a fast-track process that will see a

pilot project being launched to return 30 of the properties in the coming

months. After the first phase is completed we will move to return more of the

properties in batches of 30.

The pilot will be completed in conjunction with the existing work programme

of Operations and Maintenance and Design and Delivery who look after the

properties approved for Voids funding and properties approved under the Buy

and Renew Scheme.

We are introducing a single point of contact to assess the returned property

immediately. This will ensure that the vacated property enters a work stream

based on a standard scope and timeframe, which is determined by an

inspection of the property at the outset.

The above measures will be reviewed on a monthly basis to assess progress

made with regular reporting on same to be included in our report to Council.

**Suspension of Standing Orders**

On the proposal of Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (K), Standing Orders

were suspended in order to complete the Agenda.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, in view of the damage**

**spiralling insurance costs are causing to community groups, voluntary organisations,**

**charities and small business, calls on the Government to accelerate its insurance reform**

**programme. In particular, Limerick City and County Council calls on the Government to**

**immediately establish a distinct Insurance Fraud Unit with An Garda Síochána, establish an**

**interim Judicial Council which will address excessive awards made in our courts and insist**

**on greater transparency in relation to claims and premiums from Irish insurers.**

On proposing this motion Councillor Teskey referred to the difficulty experienced by young

people trying to obtain car insurance and the need for this to be investigated. In seconding

the motion Councillor O’Brien referred to the need for a distinct fraud unit to be established.

Members also referred to the anti-job creation environment that the rising cost of insurance

is causing.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

**I will move at the next meeting that a safety barrier and footpath be put in place between**

**the brick lodge and the roundabout on the N69 at Clarina Village as there already has been**

**numerous fatalities at this location over the years.**---
22

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne and seconded by Councillor Collins (J).

**REPLY**:

A footway currently exists between Clarina roundabout and the Brick Lodge.

A safety barrier cannot be installed at present as there is insufficient width

available to allow the barrier to be installed. Service Operations – Central

Services are currently preparing a preliminary design to improve the existing

footway arrangements for pedestrians on this section of the N69. The

improvements proposed include setting back the existing footway from the

N69 carriageway and providing a greater width of separation between the

pedestrians and vehicles. This proposal would require land acquisition. If

agreement can be reached with the affected landowners, a feasibility report

will be prepared for submission to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for

approval and funding.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

**I will move at the next meeting, that this Council, write to the Minister for Housing, Planning**

**and Local Government requesting additional funding to clear the backlog of approved**

**Disabled Person's Grants in Limerick City and County.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Benson and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

**REPLY:**

On July 3rd 2019, the letter of approval for the annual Disabled Persons Grant

allocation was made. Limerick City and County Council was approved a total of

€1,416,667.00; this amount is a significant increase from the 2018 allocation

of €504,000.00.

This significant increase will benefit Council Tenants applying for Grants in

2019.

Councillor Collins referred to the urgent need for investment and stated that there are 479

vacant consultant posts (including 23 Emergency Department Consultants) in the country and

542,000 patients waiting to see a specialist. But it is a nationwide problem that is at its most

acute in Limerick and it has the potential to affect the safety of people living in the Mid-West.

Members referred to the ongoing issues and requested that a letter issue to the CEO of UHL

Group, Colette Cowan, to provide the members with the following information:

The total number of consultant vacancies at University Hospital Limerick Group to include a

Superintendent Sugrue confirmed to the Members that Garda John Curtin, Ballylanders and
Sergeant Helen Holden, Cappamore are due to retire shortly and that plans to replace these
staff members are currently in train.

Superintendent Sugrue also informed Members about a new Community Policing Plan to be
implemented in the District, where it is proposed to break the District into Policing Areas and
assign a Community Garda to each Area. These Policing Areas will be based on population size
rather than the geographical size of an area. He confirmed that the Community Garda Policing
Policy would be to interact with local Schools and Clubs, Text Alert and Neighbourhood Watch
Groups and to deal with non-emergency issues. He explained that It is hoped that this
initiative will assist in increasing public confidence of people who are vulnerable and living in
remote areas of the District. He confirmed that a lot of Gardai have been briefed already on
this new initiative.

The Members welcomed this new initiative and agreed that the local communities would
welcome this. Members also requested that the vacant posts for Cappamore and Ballylanders
be filled as a matter of urgency to ensure continuity of service in these areas. The Members
also wished both Sergeant Helen Holden and Garda John Curtin well in their retirement.

The Members also thanked the Gardai for their support and assistance with the recent St.
Patrick’s Day parades in the District.

On his own behalf Clir. Bill O'Donnell wished Superintendent Sugrue and his team well in the
future and thanked him for all the support provided to him during his elected time with
Limerick City & County Council

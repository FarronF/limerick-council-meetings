**8.**

**Question submitted by Comhairleoir S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting how many cases have been logged on the CRM System in the***

***last year, how many have had to be re-opened, and what actions are being taken to ensure***

***that cases which are not completed are not being closed without completion.***

**REPLY**: There were 35,471 cases created on SugarCRM in 2018.

While it is not possible to determine how many were reopened during the year, there

were 29,190 cases closed in 2018 from the ones created in 2018. This represents an

82% closure rate on cases created last year.

There is intensive ongoing training across the organisation to ensure that:

1.

The correct status is used when a case is being closed namely; Resolved, Closed

Unresolved, or Closed with Commitment.

and

2.

That the accompanying update to the representative should reflect the status

of the case and set out clearly the Council’s position in relation to the request.

There are a number of approaches to ensure this occurs in conjunction with ongoing

training and support in the use of the CRM system. These include, monthly reporting

to Management re case statistics, reporting to Operations Senior Team regarding case

management and ongoing contact with both Councillors and assignees to ensure

proper responses are received.

NOTICES OF MOTION

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that a safety review of the traffic flow in the Daar Bridge***

***area be undertaken.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that a safety review of the traffic flow in

the Daar Bridge area be undertaken.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that our Authority reinstate the arrangement that was in***

***place under our Old County Authority, whereby paint was provided to tenants and local***

***authority communities who undertook the task of applying the paint themselves.***
---
8

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that the arrangements that were in place

previously, whereby paint was provided to tenants and local authority communities who

undertook to apply the paint themselves.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY**:**

The proposed motion to provide tenants and community groups with

materials, including paint cannot be reintroduced due to changes in the

insurance environment. The Council’s Health and Safety Section consulted

with Irish Public Bodies previously who advise this practice cannot be

facilitated on liability grounds.

However, the Council is currently in the initial stages of examining the

feasibility of introducing of a “Self Help Scheme” similar to the scheme

operated by Kildare County Council, which if adopted, will enable tenants to

carry out minor maintenance works on Council properties, in conjunction with

an appropriate inspection regime by Council staff.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council provide Public Wi-Fi***

***access for the towns of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins asked that Limerick City and County Council could

provide Public Wi-Fi access for the towns of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale. He stated that

providing Wi-Fi in the towns would provide a tourist opportunity and would enhance the

safety of our young people.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

We have included in our plans for 2019 the deployment of high-quality Public

WiFi in town centre locations in Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale as part of the

roll-out of WiFi4EU scheme funded by the European Commission and with the

match-funding financial support of the Department of Rural and Community

Development.

The European Commission launched in 2017 the **WfFi4EU** initiative which

promotes free access to Wi-Fi connectivity for citizens in public spaces

including parks, squares, public buildings, libraries, health centres and

museums in municipalities throughout Europe. The WiFi4EU initiative

provides municipalities with the opportunity to apply for vouchers to the value

€15,000. The vouchers are to be used to install Wi-Fi equipment in public

spaces within the municipality that are not already equipped with a free Wi-Fi

hotspot.

As of 4th of March, 2019 we have secured through our ICT Department four

vouchers under this scheme, one for each Metro and Municipal Council in

Limerick City and County. In addition, the Department of Rural and Community
---
9

Development has committed to providing up to €15,000 in funding to each Local Authority

for every WiFi4EU voucher that they receive.

We suggest that the installation of Public WiFi will be prioritised based on two criteria:

 The town population

 The technical feasibility of the installation. In some locations it could be

easier and faster to access existing communications infrastructure (e.g. the

Council WAN Network or the Smart CCTV infrastructure).

We are currently in the process of conducting a technical feasibility study in relation to the

exact towns and locations where high-quality WiFi can be deployed including Newcastle West

and Abbeyfeale and we will provide updates to the Council in due course.

The Members welcomed the reply to this Notice of Motion.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that immediate steps be taken to solve the traffic problem***

***in Collins Park, Abbeyfeale.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that it is difficult for emergency vehicles to

gain access to Collins’ Park, Abbeyfeale and requested that additional car parking spaces be

provided in Collins’ Park and to liaise with the residents of the estate on this matter.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer agreed to investigate this matter.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately put in***

***place a footpath to Kilfergus estate in Glin in order to provide safe access on foot to the***

***estate.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan stated that Limerick City and County Council

place a footpath to Kilfergus estate in Glin in order to provide safe access on foot to the estate.

He also stated that Kilfergus Housing Estate is a family oriented housing estate which has

recently been taken in charge by Limerick City and County Council.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY:

A survey has been carried out at the above location and in order to have the

minimum required road and footpath width, land take is required.

It is proposed to discuss the land take matter with the relevant landowners.

be referred to the Environment Department.

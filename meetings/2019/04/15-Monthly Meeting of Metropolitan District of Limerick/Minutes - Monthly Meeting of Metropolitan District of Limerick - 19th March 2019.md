The Mayor thanked Mr Murray for his comprehensive presentation and read the following

statement which was received from Bus Eireann in summary as follows;

Bus Éireann operate services nationwide under contract to the National Transport Authority and

these include Limerick city routes 301 – 306. Route 304 is a high frequency route, operating with

a planned 15 minute frequency while all other routes are low frequency routes operating with

planned 20/30/60 minute frequencies. Route 304 was last reviewed in December 2016 and this

review lead to the introduction of Route 304A. There were some minor changes to the running

times on Route 304 in December 2017.

Over the last 18 months we have seen an increase in congestion throughout the city particularly

at peak times. We are currently in the final stages of reviewing all the operating data collected

with a view to altering the timetables accordingly. The new punctuality assessed timetables are

expected to be introduced in April 2019. These revised timetables will reflect actual traffic

conditions including congestion pinch points and will deliver a considerable increase in reliability

and punctuality on all Limerick city routes. Following on from this and also in conjunction with

the National Transport Authority, there will be a more significant review which will look at the

routings, frequencies and stops on transport in the Limerick City environs. These changes will be

implemented in the second half of 2019.

Bus Éireann would like to apologise to any passengers who may have been frustrated when using

our services in recent months. While we sincerely regret any level of dissatisfaction on behalf of

our customers, we welcome the focus that has been placed on the importance of a reliable and

punctual bus service. We will continue to work with our partners in the National Transport

Authority, Limerick City and County Council, and all local stakeholders, to deliver an improved level

of service in Limerick City.---

The Members thanked Mr Murray for his detailed presentation and expressed disappointment

that Bus Eireann were unavailable to attend the meeting. Members discussed various routes

within the City and environs and the frustration conveyed by the public on social media. Members

emphasised the need for analysis of customer needs to be carried out and the extension of various

routes in order to cater for the demand.

Following further discussion, it was proposed by Cllr O’Hanlon, seconded by Cllr Butler and agreed

that a Special Meeting would be convened with the NTA and Bus Eireann to discuss the various

issues regarding the city bus service.

On the proposal of Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Lynch, Standing Orders were

suspended for 15 minutes in order to complete the Agenda.

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next meeting what is the status of the €15m loan that was targeted for Housing***

***Maintenance.***

**REPLY**:

A decision to draw down a loan of €15m was approved in principle by the Council

as part of the budgetary process. This will be progressed by Limerick City and

County Council and drawn down as required in accordance with the Planned

Maintenance Programme. Members will be consulted prior to any decision

regarding the allocation of resources under this programme.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next meeting what is the timeframe for the programme of works planned to***

***clean all the gutters in Watergate complex.***

**REPLY**:

The Housing Maintenance Department have assigned an Engineer to oversee this

project. In light of the difficulty of the project (H & S, Accessibility etc), quotations

will be sought from Contractors. A current estimation of the timeframe for this

project would be approximately four months.---

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council to consider extending the one way traffic system from***

***Lower Catherine Street to Upper Catherine Street with the addition of wider footpaths to***

***facilitate full pedestrianisation at various times during the year similar to Shop Street in Galway.***

**REPLY**:

Catherine Street is among a number of city centre thoroughfares which when

combined form the Great Streets Programme.

In 2001, Limerick City Council recognised that investment in urban re-

development, under a number of urban re-development schemes, needed to be

supported by an improved public realm and transport system. Following a design

competition, the Limerick City Centre Remodelling of Streets and Public Spaces

programme was adopted by Council in 2002. This programme proposed a

programme of public realm improvements across the entire city centre. This

strategy still forms the strategic basis for all public realm projects in the city. The

projects carried out to date include:

• Baker Place 2002 - creation of a new public square close to the railway station.

• Bedford Row 2006 - pedestrian priority environment adjacent to substantial

urban renewal projects.

• Thomas Street and Catherine Street 2008 - extensive public realm

improvements providing a pedestrian focus which has seen the development

of a cafe quarter within the prime city centre retail area. Cost - €4.3 million

• William Street and Sarsfield St - Public realm improvements targeted at

facilitating public transport and pedestrian priority through the primary retail

area. Cost - €3.4 million

• St. John’s Square - Remodelling of a public square that restricted car

movements and provided a multi-functional amenity for residents. Cost -

• City Quays - The remodelling of the city's waterfront to create a world class

amenity along the River Shannon. The project included the construction of

extensive boardwalk, event spaces and parks that complement a number of

private sector mixed use investments in the area.

The Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan adopted in 2014, endorsed the

Limerick City Centre Remodelling of Streets and Public Spaces programme and

proposed that the entire public realm of the city be refurbished, with an initial

focus on O'Connell Street, Henry Street and Catherine Street. This became the

Great Streets Programme.

Limerick City and County Council working with The National Transport Authority

has commenced Transport Strategy for the Metropolitan Area of Limerick-

Shannon. The Transport Strategy will address all modes of transport and will

delineate the functions of the various streets, which in turn will inform the ultimate

finished design for particular streets. It is also important to note that the design of

these streets is interdependent on one another, from identifying desire lines for

pedestrians and cyclists through to linkages to sites of interest in the city.

Therefore, the continuity in design concept that will emerge is important to the

successful implementation of the Great Streets Programme.---
9

An application under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund in 2018 to

progress the Great Streets programme was unsuccessful, however the application

itself received very positive feedback from the adjudication panel. The panel was

cognisant of the Transport Strategy and advised that it should inform the next

phases of the Great Streets Programme.

The Council intends to submit an updated application for funding under the URDF

in 2019, which will include proposals for the upgrading of Catherine Street.

**12.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council how many Council owned homes that were previously***

***occupied by tenants in the last two years are currently empty and what is the average time***

***period between a vacancy occurring and the house been relet.***

**REPLY**:

The number of Council owned houses that were occupied in the last two years

and that are currently vacant is 110.

The average time to prepare these properties to the required re-letting standard

is 34 weeks.

**13.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

***I will ask at the March Meeting of the Metropolitan District what infrastructural plans the***

***Council Executive have considered to facilitate the housing development growth in the***

***Castletroy area.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council, in partnership with The National Transport

Authority and Clare County Council, has commenced work to develop a new

Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (MATS) for the Limerick Shannon

Metropolitan Area.

The National Planning Framework (NPF) supports ambitious growth targets to

enable Limerick City to grow by at least 50% to 2040, and to enhance its significant

potential to become a city of scale. To achieve these ambitious targets a

Metropolitan Area Strategic Plan (MASP) is currently being prepared for the

Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area as the appropriate vehicle to address both

the city and suburbs, and adjoining area that supports the core of the city.

The principles underpinning the development of the MASP include the effective

integration of transport planning with spatial planning policies, from regional down

to local level and the alignment of associated transport and infrastructure

investment priorities. The MASP sets out as a priority that to the greatest extent

practicable, development within the Metropolitan Area should be carried out

sequentially, whereby lands, which are, or will be, most accessible by walking,

cycling and public transport, are prioritised. The Limerick Shannon Metropolitan

Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS), when completed, will inform the integration of

land use and transport planning within the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area

and will inform investment in transport infrastructure and services over the short,

medium and longer term to promote and encourage sustainable transport use.---
10

In addition the Castletroy Local Area Development Plan 2018 sets out the Strategy

for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area over the coming

years including the proposed infrastructural improvements that will facilitate

development in the Castletroy area.

Gilligan spoke of the importance of this statue and the need for it to be moved to a more

prominent location.

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh proposed a motion requesting that the statue was to remain in its current

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council engage with An Garda***

***the city, particularly as there is a designated purpose built cycle lane behind the houses.***

It was agreed that this Notice of Motion be referred to the Travel and Transportation Strategic

Policy Committee.

**Suspension of Standing Orders**

On the proposal of Councillor Loftus, seconded by Councillor Lynch, Standing Orders were

suspended for 15 minutes in order to complete the Agenda.

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe (to be referred to the Home and**

**Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting that this Council apply for special funding for the***

***refurbishment of the housing stock on Convent Street, given its poor condition and close***

***proximity to the Medieval Quarter.***

It was agreed that this Notice of Motion be referred to the Home and Social Development Strategic

**20.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Comhairleoir S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next meeting that Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae Luimnigh calls on the***

***Minister for Housing to designate the Limerick Metropolitan District as a Rent Pressure Zone.***

In proposing the motion, Cmhlr O’Ceallaigh called on the Minister to designate Limerick as a Rent

Pressure Zone. Cmhlr O’Ceallaigh spoke of the increasing rents and that there is no limit on what

landlords can charge to tenants. This Motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

**REPLY**:

In order to be designed a rent pressure zone there are two criteria to be met:

(a)

The annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is 7

per cent or more in four of the previous six quarters and---
13

(b)

The average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by

reference to the manner referred to in paragraph (a), is above the National

Standardised Rent in the last quarter.

Limerick City is not in a Rent Pressure zone as it only meets one of the criteria

outlined above. As of Q3 2018, the second criterion has not been met. The

Residential Tenancies Board Rent Index report for Q3 shows the standardised

average national rent for houses was €1,130 per month while the rent in Limerick

City West was €1,043.65; Limerick City North was €880.59 and Limerick City East

was €1,103.57 (within reach of the national average at €1,130).

**Suspension of Standing Orders**

On the proposal of Councillor Loftus, seconded by Councillor Hurley, Standing Orders were

suspended in order to complete the Agenda.

**21.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

***I will move at the March Metropolitan Meeting that Limerick City and County Council provide***

***adequate signage for cyclists on the busy river route from UL to the city.***

In proposing the motion, Cllr Hurley referred to the volume of traffic on the river route and the

need for management of the traffic on the route and markings on the path. This motion was

seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In response, A/Senior Executive Officer, Dara McGuigan confirmed to the Members that the river

route from UL to the City was delivered with EU grant funding as part of the Smarter Travel

programme. The programme focusses on promoting and implementing behavioural change in

how we commute for work, study and business, focussing on a modal shift away for the private

car towards public transport, cycling and walking.

Mr. McGuigan stated that a key element to this is the provision of safe and secure cycling and

walking routes, which provide users with greater accessibility and permeability to major

residential and employment hubs. The river route links Castletroy/Annacotty with the National

Technology Park and the University of Limerick, and onward to the City Centre.

The shared surface path has become established as an important commuter route allowing people

a viable alternative to regular private vehicle use, which aligns with national smarter travel targets.

Last year average weekday cyclist numbers alone at the UL boathouse counter was 376; the vast

majority of these are commuters and represent a reduction in vehicle based traffic.

This route was conceived, designed and constructed as a shared use route for pedestrians and

cyclists. The route is marked for both cycling and walking purposes, and signage advising users to

be considerate of other modes are prominently displayed at all access points to the route. Neither

cyclists nor pedestrians have priority on the route, and any steps to give priority to one mode over

the other would be in contravention of the terms of the European funding.

Mr. McGuigan confirmed that the Physical Directorate will review the current signage along the---
14

route to see if improvements can be made in relation to frequency of this signage.

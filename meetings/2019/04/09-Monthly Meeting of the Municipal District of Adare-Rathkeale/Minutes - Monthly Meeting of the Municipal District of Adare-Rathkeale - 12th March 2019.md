background to the setting up of Adare Community Trust which represents all the different

community groups in the town and highlighted the issue of the lack of parking spaces in

Adare. Mr. Treacy, Director, Adare Community Trust alsospoke of the main issue in Adare

being lack of parking spaces telling Members that currently there are 1,463 people

working from 90 businesses operating in the town while the population of the town stands

at 1,200 and as a result parking in the village is a huge issue. Mr. Treacy, on behalf of

Adare Community Trust, welcomed the new parking area across from the National School,

but felt it is a little too far out of the town and asked Limerick City and County Council to

consider additional parking spaces closer to the town centre. Mr. Treacy concluded saying

Adare Community Trust would continue to encourage people to work, live and visit the

town and they would endeavour to keep Adare a heritage town.

Ms. Sparling, The Manor Fields, then addressed the Meeting. She thanked Members for

their support and briefed Members on the progress of the Manor Fields project to date

and went on to say the facility, which will be operating ten years this summer, is a regional---

facility for various sporting organisations. The opening of the astro pitch has been a

runaway success and they are close to finalising funding for a new pavilion building and

asked for the Members continuing support going forward.

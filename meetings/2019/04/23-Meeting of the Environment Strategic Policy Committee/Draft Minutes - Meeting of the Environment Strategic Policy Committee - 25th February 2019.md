**Item 2: Presentation on the Limerick City and County Council Climate Adaptation Strategy**

**– Mr Dara McGuigan, A/S.E.O. and Mr. Tom O’Neill, Heritage Officer.**

Mr McGuigan advised the Committee that the Physical Development Directorate, in

conjunction with Economic Development Directorate, was preparing a draft Climate Change

Adaptation Strategy in accordance with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low

Carbon Act 2015 and the National Adaptation Framework.

The Strategy would attempt to address how the Council will adapt its plans, processes and

policies to take account of the current and future effects of climate change-related extreme

weather events, to minimise the harmful effects and exploit any beneficial opportunities of

climate change.

The local authority sector is one of 12 sectors nationally which are charged with producing

climate adaptation strategies in 2019. The deadline for adoption of the Strategies is 30th

September, 2019. He advised that the Strategy was being drafted at present, and that the

Members would have an opportunity to comment on it during a public consultation period

later in the process.

The Members welcomed the presentation and raised a number of matters relating to the

impacts of Climate Change on Limerick and the country as a whole.

**Item 3: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M Collins**

“I will move at the next meeting that this Municipal District will impose a voluntary ban on

election posters for this year’s Council, European and any Referenda elections taking place on

24th May 2019.”

In proposing the Motion Cllr Collins explained that the Members in the Newcastle West

District had agreed to the voluntary ban on election posters during the forthcoming elections,

and that he had proposed at the District Meeting that the Motion should be sent forward to

the Strategic Policy Committee for discussion with a view to recommending that the Full

Council adopt the voluntary ban.

Cllr Collins stated that it takes 400 years for “corriboard” to biodegrade. During the 2014

elections there were an estimated 611,000 posters manufactured, resulting in the generation

of approximately 363 tonnes of CO2. Posters were detrimental to marine life and the

environment in general. Posters could also become a health and safety issue for drivers and

the public alike. He called on all candidates to go poster free for the forthcoming elections.

In response, Mr Kennedy advised that legislation currently permits candidates to erect

election posters within certain timeframes. It is not therefore an offence for election

candidates to erect and display posters, if they comply with the relevant time periods set out

in the legislation. He went on to state that the Council would not be in a position to enforce

against breaches of the voluntary ban were this to occur.

The Members debated the Motion at length, setting out the pros and cons of the motion. The

key element for many was the voluntary nature of the proposed ban. Following agreed

amendments to the wording of the Motion, Cllr Collins proposed that the amended wording

be sent to Full Council for consideration. Cllr O’Hanlon seconded the Motion.

**‘I will move at the next meeting of the Full Council that all election candidates of this**

**Council agree to a voluntary ban on the erection of election posters for all elections.’**

**Item 4: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan**

“I will move at the next meeting that this Council immediately enact local bye-laws making

all refuse collectors charge customers only on a pay by weight basis.”---

In proposing the Motion, Cllr. Gilligan stated that the only payment option open to waste

collectors should be pay-by-weight, as a flat rate charge ran contrary to waste reduction

policy.

In responding, Mr Kennedy pointed out that between September 2017 and September 2018

the flat rate option had been phased out. The only charging options open to waste collectors

now were pay-by-weight or pay-by-lift. He went on to say that, the phasing out of the flat-

rate fee offering by waste collectors has been conditioned by the National Waste Collection

Permit Office in Offaly (NWCPO), through the individual Household Collector’s Permit

Conditions. The introduction of separate byelaws to regulate this would not therefore be

appropriate.

Following discussion by the Members, Cllr Gilligan thanked the Director for his response.

Themeeting then concluded.---

Mr. Murray gave a presentation on the Roads Grants advised by the respective funding
bodies Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TI), the Department of Transport (DTTAS), Tourism
and Sport and the National Transport Authority (NTA) to the Council for 2019.

The combined total of grants for 2019 for Limerick is €39.25 million, which is an increase of
approximately €10 million on 2018 grants.

Til grants for 2019 have increased by approximately €1 million on 2018 grants, due in large
to the high proportion of motorway and national roads schemes in the mid-west region.
Funding in the amount of €2.15 million has been provided to advance the M20 Limerick to

Cork scheme, and funding in the amount of €1.4 million has been provided to advance the
N69 Foynes to Limerick Scheme in 2019. €450,000 has been provided for both the N21
Abbeyfeale Relief Road and the N21 Newcastle West Relief Road projects, and €100,000 for
each of the N20 O’Rourke’s Cross and the N24 Beary’s Cross schemes.

Mr Murray advised that the DTTAS grants for 2019 were €26.2 million, which represents an
increase on 2018 grants. This funding is for the upgrade and maintenance of regional and
local roads networks, and includes provision for winter maintenance. Included in the grant
is the amount of €7.5 million to advance the second phase of the Coonagh to Knockalisheen
Scheme.

He advised that €384,000 had been provided by the Department of Rural and Community
Development for the Local Improvement Scheme which provides funding for private roads
in rural areas.

He stated that the NTA grants were likely to be approximately €2.75 million in 2019 for the
promotion of cycling, walking and public transport in urban areas.

In welcoming the presentation and grant funding the Members raised the following queries:

Clir Pond: (1) Progress on the Ballysimon-Golf Links Road junction.
(2) Funding for Knockalisheen to R445 phase of the Limerick Northern
Distributor Road (LNDR).
(3) Progress on the Castletroy Urban Greenway.
(4) Funding for the N24.

In response, Mr Murray confirmed that the funding allocated for the Golf Links Road will
bring the scheme through the Part 8 process, but that works will only commence in 2019.
He confirmed that funding for the LNDR had been allocated to the lead authority Clare
County Council which would bring the scheme through the statutory processes. He advised
that the Council was working with developers to advance the Castletroy Greenway, but that
no final solution has been agreed as yet. In relation to the N24, Mr Murray advised that TIl
has yet to decide what its proposals are for this road.

Cllr Browne: (1) Route selection and the sterilization of lands for the Abbeyfeale Relief

Road.
(2) Til funding for the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan.

In response, Mr Murray advised that the Roads Design Office is in the process of appointing
consultants from the TIl Framework for both the Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West Relief
Roads. He confirmed that no routes had been identified as yet. He also advised that the
Council is speaking with TIl with a view to agreeing a funding split for the Abbeyfeale Traffic
Management Plan.

Clir Lynch: (1) No funding provided for traffic management at Clarina.

Mr Murray advised that the speed limit of this stretch will be reduced if the Council
approves the Review of the Speed Limits, which will come before it shortly. He added that

this may allow the Council to bring forward proposals for further calming and
improvements.

Cllr Donegan: (1) Funding for Croom Distributor Road.
(2) Public lighting and traffic calming at the N20 at Banogue.
(3) Works on N20 Ballyphilip to Howardstown.

In response, Mr Murray confirmed that the cost of the Croom Distributor Road have been
agreed between the Council, LCETB and DTTAS. He also confirmed that there was a small
bit of land remaining to be compulsorily purchased for this scheme. He stated that no
funding had been allocated in 2019 by TIl for traffic calming or public lighting at Banogue,
but that the local engineer could apply for GeoApp funding for this. He advised that he was
not aware of Anhid Cross being included in the N20 Ballyphilip to Howardstown scheme. Mr
Kennedy advised the contractor was doing upgrades to the junctions under the scope of the
works.

Mr Tierney: (1) Update on access from the M20 to the city from the southside
junction.
(2) Update on changes to signage from the Limerick Tunnel to the city.

Mr Murray advised that the Social Development Directorate had recently tendered for a
report which would include a review of accessibility from the M20 to the southside. In
relation to the Tunnel signage he advised that the Council had brought this to the attention
of Til, and that the latter had indicated that it would consider it as part of a review of its
signage programme.

Cllr O’Hanlon: (1) What is funding for the Park Bridge for?
(2) Can the concrete bund under the existing bridge be removed?
(3) Can Bus Eireann be invited to a future meeting of the SPC?

Mr Murray advised that consultants are currently finalising an Options Report for the Park
Bridge. It would look at all options, which may include a new bridge or upgrades to the
existing structure. Construction of the preferred option would likely commence in 2020. He
advised that the removal of the concrete bund was a matter for Waterways Ireland, but that
the Council could ask it to consider the request. Mr Murray advised that he understood that
Bus Eireann is currently reviewing its services and routes, but that they could be invited to a
future meeting of the committee.

Cllr O’Hanlon formally proposed that Bus Eireann be invited to make a presentation at the
next meeting of the SPC. This proposal was seconded by Cllr Lynch.

Item 3: Presentation on the Limerick City and County Council Climate Adaptation

Strategy ~ Mr Dara McGuigan, A/S.E.0. and Mr. Tom O'Neill, Heritage
Officer.

Mr McGuigan advised the committee that the Physical Development Directorate, in
conjunction with Economic Development Directorate, was preparing a draft Climate Change

3

*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

Adaptation Strategy in accordance with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low
Carbon Act 2015 and the National Adaptation Framework.

The Strategy would attempt to address how the Council will adapt its plans, processes and
policies to take account of the current and future effects of climate change-related extreme
weather events, to minimise the harmful effects and exploit any beneficial opportunities of
climate change.

The local authority sector is one of 12 sectors nationally which are charged with producing
climate adaptation strategies in 2019. The deadline for adoption of the Strategies is 30
September, 2019. He advised that the Strategy was being drafted at present, and that the
Members would have an opportunity to comment on it during a public consultation period
later in the process.

Item 4:Use of agricultural machinery on the Great Southern Greenway — Mr. Denis
McAuliffe.

Mr McAuliffe raised a concern that landowners with lands on both sides of the Great Southern
Greenway were using the Greenway as an access route to bring agricultural machinery from
one landholding to another, thereby causing damage to the surface of the Greenway, and
potentially causing danger and inconvenience to users of the trail. He called for bye-laws
regulating the use of the Greenway to be introduced.

Mr Kennedy responded that Physical Development in conjunction with our colleagues in
Social Development, and Sports Ireland will review the situation. He went on to advise that
the Council had secured €2.7 million in funding from the Rural Regeneration Development
Fund to upgrade the surface of the Greenway to Irish Trails Office standard, and to develop a
link from the trail to the Barnagh Tunnel and the viewing point on Barnagh Hill. Clir Browne
welcomed the funding and hoped that the issues raised could be resolved.

The Meeting then concluded.

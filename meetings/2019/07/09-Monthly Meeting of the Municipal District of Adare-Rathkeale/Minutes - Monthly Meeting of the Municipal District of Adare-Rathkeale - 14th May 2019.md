for clarity on why it has not yet been cut. Councillor Keary stated hedgerows were also
in need of cutting to ensure road users safety. The Director of Service advised Members
a decision had been taken early in the year by the Environment Department to delay
rass cutting to assist bee pollination and the contractor procured to carry out the grass
cutting had subsequently withdrawn at the last minute which had caused further delay.

obligation is on the landowner to ensure their hedges are cut back between September
and March and to ensure they do not cause a danger to road users.

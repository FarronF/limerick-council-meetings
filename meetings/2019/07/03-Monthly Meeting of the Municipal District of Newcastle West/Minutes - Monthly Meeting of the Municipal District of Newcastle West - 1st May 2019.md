---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
REPLY:

A working draft of the Public Realm Plan will be presented to Dromcollogher
Community Council by the end of May 2019. Following on from this a second
public consultation event will take place in Dromcollogher in June 2019 where
members of the public will be invited to provide comments on the proposals
outlined in the draft plan. Following this consultation the plan will be finalised
and published.

9. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting that a review of the Sugar CRM system be undertaken and
that Councillors get a response by email with the subject heading that was originally sent.

REPLY:

There were 35,471 cases created on SugarCRM in 2018, with 29,190 cases
closed in 2018 from the ones created in 2018. This represents an 82% closure
rate on cases created last year. The SugarCRM system has proven to be a very
important tool in the management of all requests to the Council from both a
tracking and business continuance perspective.

The administration of representations from public representatives along with
the SugarCRM system are continually being reviewed.

There is intensive ongoing training across the organisation to ensure that the
correct status is used when a case is being closed namely; Resolved, Closed
Unresolved, or Closed with Commitment and that the accompanying update
to the representative should reflect the status of the case in order to set out
clearly the Council's position in relation to the request.

There are a number of approaches to ensure this occurs in conjunction to
ongoing training and support in the use of the CRM system. These include,
monthly reporting to Management re case statistics, reporting to Operations
Senior Team regarding case management and ongoing contact with both
councillors and assignees to ensure proper responses are received.

With regard to the subject line, the policy has been to amend if it contains
personal information. This has been to ensure that there is no breach in
personal data and also to ensure that the most up to date customer contact
details are maintained on SugarCRM. This then ensures that the customers
contact details are kept in a single place and are readily accessible if required
by staff handling the request.

The My Limerick platform has the potential to show the public representative
the customer details associated with their case so Councillors have been
contacted and met several times regarding the My Limerick platform and
advised to contact Customer Services senior staff should they require any
particular follow up on named cases. Also, it should be noted that each case

---

automatic case number assigned, which is unique to each case for
identification purposes.

With the advancement of a new Council shortly, a further review of
representation management will be undertaken and consideration can be
given to not amending the subject line on email requests from Councillors
going forward.

A brief discussion followed on the Sugar CRM system and the closing of cases, particularly
cases which are closed with commitment. The Director agreed that the system needed some
adjustments and these can be considered. The Senior Executive Engineer also stated that the
system was the best mechanism to support Councillors.

10. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will ask at the next Meeting that scoop the poop bins be located in Abbeyfeale town within
the speed limits area.

REPLY: In accordance with the Council's policy, there are no further plans to install any
dog bins in the City or County at present. However, dog walkers may place this
bagged waste in the public street bins as per the Council's protocol of “any
bag, any bin”.

Councillor Galvin stated that there are only two scoop the poop bins located from the Mart
Bridge in Abbeyfeale to Mountmahon and asked that scoop the poop bins be located in
Abbeyfeale town within the speed limits area.

11. Question submitted by Councillor M. Collins

! will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the provision of traffic ramps at Gortboy,

the help and support given towards this project.

The Members acknowledged the correspondence but expressed their disappointment that
the building of the facility had not commenced. They noted the work of the committee and

the Council and noted that funding was not allocated under the Rural Regeneration and
Development Fund.

Infrastructure Fund. It was proposed by Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor Foley
that Minister P. O'Donovan should be contacted with regard to prioritising central
government funding for the project.

The following items were also raised.

The Members raised the amended Notice of Motion on a public swimming pool for Newcastle

Executive.

We the Councillors of the Municipal District of Newcastle West call on the Chief Executive
of Limerick City and County Council to begin the process to apply for funding for the
provision of a 25 metre public swimming facility/pool to be located in Newcastle West Town
to serve the people of the Municipal District and its hinterland.

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
REPLY: The funding mechanism from central government (Department of Transport
Tourism and Sport) for the construction of new swimming pools is the Large
Scale Sport infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). This is a new fund that was introduced
under the National Planning Framework: Ireland 2040. The Fund replaces the
previous programme that was in place for funding local authority swimming
pools. The first call under this Fund was issued early in 2019 and closed for
applications on 17" April 2019.

The LSSIF is a complex, onerous and nationally competitive application
process. It requires in the first instance that any proposed projects are
“identified as a priority within @ local authority’s development plan and
strategic vision, demonstrating cross-sector collaboration and clearly identified
local priorities”. The preparation of a sports and recreation strategy for
Limerick City and County is a necessary first step in setting out our strategic
vision and priorities. The application process to this Fund requires that all
planning and consents are in place, design and costs are fully developed, match
funding is in place, and an economic appraisal has been conducted to meet
with requirements under the Public Spending Code. The application process
also requires that a business plan and operational plan are developed. In view
of the above requirements set by central government, the preparation of a
Sports and Recreation Strategy for Limerick City and County Council is now
being commissioned by the Council. This will provide the strategic context for
review of potential projects that could be presented as applications to the
LSSIF in the future.

A discussion took place on the above and the Members stated that Limerick City and County
Council should prioritise the provision of a swimming pool for the town of Newcastle West.
They also referred to their request to meet with the Chief Executive on the matter. The
Director stated that a request for the Meeting had been noted and a date is to be agreed.

An update was sought on connectivity through the L21021 from the N21 at Barnagh to allow
access to property and the Senior Executive Engineer stated that legal advice has been sought
on this and the matter is ongoing.

The recent road lining works in the Feohanagh/Castlemahon area were referred to and
appreciation was expressed for the works carried out.

An update on the road at Glenduff where the windfarm is being installed was requested. The
Executive Engineer confirmed that works to this roadway will commence when installation of
the windfarm is complete. In the meantime, the Contractor is to carry out interim repairs on
this roadway.

An update was sought on a request for a safety audit to be carried out by the Til on the N21
junction at Coolanoran, Newcastle West, known as Sweeps Cross and at the junction at
Cregan’s Cross, Newcastle West. The Senior Executive Engineer stated that he would follow
up on this with Central Services.

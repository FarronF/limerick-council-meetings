**QUESTIONS**

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to the

Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

**I will ask at the next meeting for an update on when Limerick City and County Council will**

**take in charge Steamboat Quay.**

**REPLY**:

In 2014 requests were received from businesses and residents of Steamboat

Quay for Limerick City Council to take the area in charge.  Since the economic

downturn of circa 2009 onwards, there had been little investment in the public

space of Steamboat Quay.

Limerick City and County Council is currently engaged with property owners in

Steamboat Quay to resolve issues around roads and public open spaces, and

to take the whole area in charge. There are a number of different owners of---
16

car parking, footpaths and open space along Steamboat Quay and engagement

with the various parties is ongoing.

If the Council were to take Steamboat Quay in charge, there would be a

significant cost to the local authority to bring it up to an acceptable standard.

Extensive works are required on the following elements: road pavement,

footpaths, boardwalk, storm and foul drainage, public lighting, signage and

road marking and parking.

It is difficult to put a timeline on when these matters will be resolved, but the

Council will continue to progress the matter in 2019.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

**I will ask at the next meeting for an update on Maddens Derelict Building on Ellen Street,**

**Limerick City. It is a major concern to business people, residents and pedestrians.**

**REPLY:**

The site was placed on the Derelict Sites Register in February 2018. A planning

application was submitted in 2018 and permission granted for a language

school, retail shops, apartments and a car park. An amendment to the

planning permission for a guest house instead of the retail shops has been

applied for (planning ref: 18/1077).

The site is also on the Vacant Sites Register and a vacant sites levy is due on

the property on 1st January 2020. In addition works to secure the property

have been carried out on foot of notices submitted under the Sanitary Services

Act (1964) – Dangerous Structures Notice.

All unresolved derelict site cases are under regular review.

provided to the primary school children in Abbeyfeale and the importance of this service

being reinstated in Abbeyfeale. Cllr Galvin requested this notice of motion be forwarded to

the Limerick TD’s for their attention also. This motion was seconded by Councillor Gilligan.

**District, (Councillors M. Donegan, N. Gleeson, G. Mitchell, W. O’Donnell, E. Ryan,**

**L.M. Sheehy, B. Teefy)**

**I will move that this Council write to the Minister for Transport requesting the present**

**legislation recently enacted in relation to the Road Traffic Act in relation to vehicle drivers**

**be revisited.**

In proposing the motion Councillor Mitchell referred to the new legislation enacted and the

impact that this is having on rural drivers. In seconding the motion Councillor O’Donnell stated

while he doesn’t condone drink driving he stated that the new laws are creating fear in rural

Limerick and people don’t fully understand the limitations.

promote road safety.

**I will move at the next meeting that this Council write to the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar,**

**Minister Pascal Donohue, Minister Simon Harris and Minister Finian Mc Grath requesting**

**that they instruct their relevant Departments to introduce a universal scheme to provide**

**for the care and needs of people with disabilities, focusing solely on the person with the**

**disability and not on household income as is the case at present.**---
18

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheahan (J) referred to the parents of children with a

physical disability and the urgent need for respite to be provided regardless of their financial

means. The restrictions on the financial income of a family results in some cases, one parent

having to give up their job in order to care for their child. In seconding the motion, Councillor

Galvin referred to a specific case that he became aware of recently and stated the urgent

need for families with a disabled child to be prioritised by the introduction of a universal

scheme.

Councillor Costelloe proposed that a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council be held in

relation to the proposed closure of the recycling depot on Park Road.

This was seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.

The Director (Service Operations) congratulated Councillor Butler on his year as Mayor and wished

the incoming Cathaoirleach, Councillor James Collins, every success in the year ahead. He stated

that he was looking forward to working with all the Members in the year ahead.

Members stated that they had received a large volume of telephone calls and texts from the public

objecting to such closure. A lot of elderly people use this recycling facility and they expressed their

total opposition to the closure of same. They requested that the present facility should remain open

and if it has to close due to health and safety reasons, then an alternative site should be identified.

Members requested a copy of the health and safety report on the site.

Councillor Butler cautioned Members that there is a Report from experts recommending the closure

of the site on health and safety grounds and asked if the Councillors would take responsibility if any

accidents occurred there.

The Cathaoirleach asked that the relevant officials be in attendance at the Special Meeting.

He confirmed that the recycling plant in Park Road had to be closed down on health and safety

grounds and pointed out that Limerick City and County Council is required by law to provide safe

services for staff and for members of the public. A Safety Audit was undertaken in the end of 2018

which required the Centre to be closed down on health and safety grounds as it ‘posed a serious

risk of accidents’. The advice he received was that the site was too small and the risk too great to

remain open. He fully appreciated the loss of this facility. He added that the most usage of the site

is paper and cardboard with small amounts of electrical items. He informed Members that the

Council will be spending a lot of finance on the site and it is intended to keep the bottle, cans and

clothes banks open. He pointed out that most people have wheelie bins which can be used for dry

recyclables.

It was proposed by Councillor Joe Leddin, seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed that there

would be no changes to the current services pending Special Meeting.

Members pointed out that there has been no accidents or incidents there to date and enquired if

the Report was carried out in December why had an alternative site not been identified. They stated

that a commitment is needed that another site will be identified in the area.

Councillor O’Hanlon suggested that the site remain open with no vehicle access into the site.

The Director (Service Operations) stated that he delayed the closure of the site until he went out to

inspect the site himself and confirmed that it does pose a health and safety risk. He stated that his

job is to make sure risks are minimised and that the health and safety of employees and members

of the public are observed at all times. He indicated that there is a health and safety concern also

about the roadway outside the facility and pointed out that this facility would not be closing if there

was any other choice.

He pointed out that a number of alternative sites were examined and a proposal on Childers Road

in the mid 1990’s was met with considerable local opposition.

He confirmed that the recycling depot on Park Road will be closed on Monday, 17th June, 2019.

It was agreed to organise a special meeting to allow for further discussion as soon as possible.

This concluded the Meeting.

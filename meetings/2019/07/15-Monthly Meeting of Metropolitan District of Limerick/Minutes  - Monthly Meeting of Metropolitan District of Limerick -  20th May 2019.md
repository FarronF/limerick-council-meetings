**QUESTIONS**

**3.**

**Question submitted by** **Cmhlr S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting when is it planned for the Sub Committee, established last year to***

***work on issues of Animal Control and Welfare, to meet for the first time.***

**REPLY:**

The Horse Control Committee was established in 2015 as a result of concerns

regarding the increases in horse seizures and the escalating costs of providing

control of horses services.

It provides an informal forum for Members to discuss relevant issues in relation to

the control of horses in the Metropolitan District.

To ensure broad representation in the Horse Control Committee, the Committee

reflects a geographical spread across the Electoral Areas of the Metropolitan

District, and includes Members of all political allegiances. Accordingly, all the

Members of the Metropolitan District were given the opportunity to nominate

themselves to participate in the Committee on this basis.

The Committee has met on a number of occasions since its establishment in 2015,

and has undertaken research trips to the Tralee Horse Project (2017) and the

Clondalkin Equine Club (2018).

As the members of the Committee have been drawn from the Members of the

Metropolitan District Council, it is proposed place an item on the agenda of the

first meeting of the new Metropolitan District to seek nominations for the

Committee.

Arrangements will then be made to convene a meeting, at which members will be

updated on the learnings from the Clondalkin study visit.

***Area Transport Strategy Study. Councillors were promised the opportunity to provide input to***

***the consultation process on behalf of constituents.***

**REPLY:**

The National Transport Authority (NTA), in partnership with Limerick City and

County Council (LCCC) and Clare County Council (CCC), has commenced work to

develop a new Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (MATS) for the Limerick

Shannon Metropolitan Area.

The LSMATS will set out a series of actions and measures, covering infrastructural,

operational and policy elements to be implemented in the Limerick Shannon

Metropolitan Area over the next 20 years and will outline a framework to deliver

the projects in a phased manner. The strategy will take account of current and

predicted population, National Planning Framework objectives, national transport

policies, existing plans and strategies in the region and existing transport assets.

Progress to date has included the collation of data in relation to land use forecasts

and demand analysis modelling. Analysis is currently under way and a Baseline

Report is being drafted.

The next step is review of the Baseline Report and the Demand Analysis Report by

LCCC and CCC and feedback to the NTA.

Once the review of baseline and demand analysis is complete, development of

transport options will commence. Stakeholder and Public consultation will

commence in June/July 2019 where organisations and the wider public will have

an opportunity to feed into the strategy.

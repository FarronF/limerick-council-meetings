1. Road Works in Bruree

The Cathaoirleach welcomed all to the Meeting and confirmed that he had called the Special
Meeting following numerous calls from people residing in the Bruree area who had expressed
concerns to him and other elected Members about current issues relating to works being
carried out by Limerick City & County Council in Bruree.

The Elected Members outlined the details of the concerns they had received from the
community in Bruree in relation to the works and Issues relating to reduced parking
availability, especially at times when a funeral or mass was on in Bruree. In addition, concerns
had been expressed in relation to the fencing works carried out at the location; queries
relating to the legal ownership of some of the land where the works were taking place, along
with the turning of vehicles at this location were also mentioned. Reference was also made
to the possible provision of additional parking on the Kilmallock side of Bruree on some
existing green space.

The Executive Engineer Cappamore-Kilmallock circulated a layout plan of the proposed works
in Bruree. He confirmed that Part 8 or other such approval was not required for the roadworks
as it was works related to the existing road space and the existing public road width was not
being altered.

He confirmed that some discussions had taken place with the Tidy Towns group in Bruree
about the road works, as well as an adjoining landowner, so that a line of kerbing within his
folio could be agreed. Following a request from Elected Members, a further meeting was also
arranged on site to amend the line of kerbing across from the six townhouses, and this
amendment was agreed with the occupiers of same following this meeting.

He detailed the Folio details outlining legal ownership of various pieces of land relating to the
area where the roadworks were taking place and confirmed that the local authority was
satisfied with the ownership details of land where the road works were taking place. He
confirmed that the ownership of the green space referred to for additional parking could also
be clarified to ascertain ownership, etc.

He also confirmed that the kerbing works installed were required to define the road edge for
the road overlay works and to tidy up the public space. There was also a set down area to
facilitate possible bus parking, along with a set down area to facilitate access and servicing of
the recycling bring banks, which were also located at the works location. He confirmed that
these roadworks would make this section of road safer and define the area for road users. He
confirmed to the Elected Members that the current road works would proceed as the
contractor for the road overlay works was appointed and in place and initial programme dates
had been issued for the scheduled works to be carried out.

With regard to the query about fencing completed at this location, it was confirmed that this
query had been referred to the Planning Enforcement section of Limerick City & County
Council. They would be responsible for looking at this issue separate from the current
roadworks project as these fencing works were not part of the local authority's works at this
location. In relation to the query on the ownership of the bridge, while this does not impact
on the proposed works it was agreed to review how it ended up in private ownership.

The Elected Members thanked the Executive Engineer, Cappamore-Kilmallock for his
presentation and acknowledged the work he was doing in delivering a range of roads work
projects across the Municipal District.

This concluded the Meeting.

10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Brigid Teefy

I will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that
Limerick City & County Council put traffic calming measures in place in the Ardykeohane
area of Bruff on the R516 road to Hospital as this is a very busy road and narrows down in
a section between two bends on the outskirts of the town.

Proposed by Clir. Teefy, seconded by Clir. Mitchell.

Reply:

A Traffic Count was carried out on this road last year and Traffic Counters were placed on
the Hospital side of Bruff GAA Field. The results of this Traffic Count are attached and
indicate that nearly 80% of the traffic was outside the speed limit at this location.

As part of the Section 38 proposed for Bruff village, Limerick City & County Council have
included for a raised speed table to be placed on the junction with the R512 but not further
out the R516. Provision for the placement of a speed cushion inside the speed limit on the
R516, as an amendment to the current Section 38 proposal, could be considered but would
be subject to the provision of additional funding to carry out these additional works.

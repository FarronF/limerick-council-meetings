Two safety issues were identified as part of the RSI Process and the inspection

team recommended feasibility stage solutions.

Staff from Mid West National Road Design Office (MWNRDO) carried out a

further assessment of this location and the safety issues raised. MWNRDO

recommended to TII that initial design stage solutions be advanced and that

technical engineering consultancy services be procured to carry this out. TII

approved funding for 2019 for engineering consultancy services.

Barry Transportation were appointed by Limerick City & County Council in April

2019 to progress initial stage design solutions for the junction and, subject to

TII approval, a detailed design solution and tender stage services.

Barry Transportation are progressing the initial design stage solutions for this

location and to progress the design, a topographical survey and traffic survey

have been carried out.

They are examining a number of options and assessing the benefits and

disbenefits of each and will present their options and recommendations in the

coming weeks. The options and recommendations will be reviewed by staff in

the Road Design Office and TII.

Subject to TII approval of recommended options and approval of necessary

funding, Barry Transportation will proceed with the design process for the

preferred option and a construction cost estimate for the design. This is

programmed for 2020 and construction of any designed scheme will be further

subject to TII funding.

A 1 km section of the N21, located east of Abbeyfeale was identified as having

a high collision rate under TII’s HD15 Network Safety Analysis Process. N21

Wards Cross is centred on this HD15 site. Ward’s Cross is the junction of the

N21 national road with the L7091 local road. The site was further analysed by

staff from Mid West National Road Design Office and a feasibility report was

prepared recommending the installation of a right turn lane on the N21 at

Ward’s Cross. TII granted approval for the construction of a right turn lane at

this location.

As part of Barry Transportation’s commission for the N21 Devon Cross, they

were also appointed to carry out a detailed design of the right turn lane at N21

Ward’s Cross. A ground investigation and topographical survey have been

carried out and Barry Transportation are progressing the detailed design for

submission to TII for approval.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council change its policy within the Tier 5***

***Settlements for the village of Mountcollins.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 made provision for the extension of

the lifetime of both the Limerick City and Limerick County Development Plans,

pending the making of a National Planning Framework (NPF) and Regional

Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES). In accordance with this provision, both

Development Plans were extended, with no defined expiration date. The 2018

Planning and Development amendment Act requires the preparation of a new

development plan to commence within 26 weeks of the making of the initial

Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy.

The NPF was published on the 16th February 2018 and the RSES based on

current information will be adopted by the end of 2019. Therefore, the

preparation of the Limerick City and County Development Plan legally must

commence within 26 weeks of that date. However, given the outdated nature

of both plans, it is proposed that the review will commence with the

publication of an issues paper in Q2 2020. The review will commence the

statutory 99 week process of preparing a new development plan. The

preliminary work will commence in advance of this date and briefing meetings

with the Elected Members will take place in early 2020.

This review will consider the policy for all settlements within Limerick City and

County.

Discussion took place on the current Limerick City and County Development Plan and the

guidelines being followed for developments which are seeking permission outside the core

areas of towns. Reference was also made to the rural housing in the proposed National

Planning Framework.

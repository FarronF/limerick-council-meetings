**Update on Draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy**

Ms. M. Woods, A/Senior Planner, gave a comprehensive presentation on the update

of the Draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Southern

Region.

The purpose of the RSES is to support the implementation of National Planning

Framework. It will influence and guide Limerick’s Development Plan and Local Area

Plans over the next 12 years and will influence decisions on government investment.

Cllrs. John Sheahan, Michael Collins and Frankie Daly are the 3 representatives

from Limerick sitting on the Regional Assembly(RA).

She highlighted some of the key issues raised by Limerick City and County Council

and the responses received from the Director of the RA:

 Over emphasis on Cork in terms of balanced regional growth – to be amended in

final RSES.

 Lack of emphasis on the Primacy of Limerick City – to be amended in final RSES

 Prematurity of South Clare SDZ pending development of city centre –

amendments to proposed SDZ not carried.---
 MASP fails to set out a clear strategic and co-ordinated approach for the future

growth, development and investment of the Metropolitan Area – to be amended.

 Potential for development of Newcastlewest was undersold – to be amended.

 Lack of associated actions for Climate Resilient City – to be amended.

 Request for ban on incineration in the Southern Region – a matter for national

government.

She stated that the RSES will be adopted by the Assembly Members by the end of

the year and preparation for the 1st Joint Limerick City and County Development Plan

is to commence within 26 weeks from date of adoption. She informed members that

background work has already commenced on preparing research papers and the

process will formally commence in April 2020. Workshops and training will be

carried out with elected members in the preparation of the Development Plan.

While members thanked Maria for her update on RSES a number of members

expressed concern over the level of restrictions on expansion of rural / family

businesses, which are the heartbeat of most communities. She acknowledged that

not all rural areas were sufficiently serviced and that they hoped to identify

settlements to develop services in the new joint development plan, to encourage

enterprise in rural towns.

Members also expressed concern that RSES was not in alignment with the National

Planning Framework due to lack of actions for climate change.

It was stated that the economic benefits of a comprehensive greenway strategy

(local and regional) should be examined in order to revitalise many small towns and

villages.

On the proposal of Cllr.Galvin,seconded by Cllr. Keary,it was unanimously agreed to

suspend Standing Orders in order to allow the completion of the meeting.

in place between private and public bodies.

She stated that the LDA have been invited to view two large tracts of land in the

Dock Road area and lands in the vicinity of the railway station, with the purpose of

developing a Masterplan for the development of these sites.

M. Woods assured members that LCCC will be working in collaboration with the LDA

in developing a masterplan for the areas, with the purpose of increasing employment

and residential in the city centre. She stated that the local authority would not have

the financial resources itself to carry out such a masterplan.---
V. Murray informed members that board members from the Land Development

Agency will be convening a meeting in Limerick in the next few weeks to look at

various options.

On the proposal of Cllr. O’Sullivan, seconded by Cllr. Galvin, it was unanimously

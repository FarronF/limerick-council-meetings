**QUESTIONS**

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the Coke Zero Bike Scheme proposed extension to***

***L.I.T. Also, when the opening of the Colbert Station Bike Scheme and reopening of the King Johns***

***Castle Station might take place and why there is currently a delay with this scheme.***

**REPLY:**

The Coke Zero Bike Scheme is operated in Limerick by the National Transport

Authority (NTA). The scheme commenced in 2014 and there are currently 23 active

docking stations with approximately 215 bikes in service. There are plans to add

additional stations to the network in 2019 and 2020. The following outlines the

status of each of the stations requested:

**LIT:**

A site survey and preliminary design has been completed on the LIT scheme. The

Coke Zero station design team is awaiting the final agreed layout of the LIT to city

centre cycle facilities in order to finalise the station positions on this route. It is

anticipated that Part 8 will be lodged in early 2020.

**Colbert Station:**

In order to progress this station an element of ground works was required which is

now completed. Wiring has now been installed and the station is expected to be

operational by the end of November 2019.

**King John’s Castle:**

A site survey has been completed on this station and preliminary design has been

drafted. Construction of new station is programmed by the NTA for Quarter 1, 2020.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, given that insurance considerations are having an impact on the***

***quality of repair works being carried out (for example poured cement being used instead of stone***

***paving on Thomond Bridge) could I ask what level of claims have been submitted and settled or***

***are outstanding in relation to footpaths/pavements and what impact this has had on urban***

***design.***
---
5

**REPLY:**

The number of active claims that relate to Slips/Trips on footpaths as at 30th

September, 2019. amounted to 361. This figure reflects all footpath claims including

those in open spaces, parks, playgrounds, burial grounds etc.

The number of new claims registered in 2019 which resulted in footpath injuries

amounts to 50. This figure was 103 in 2018, a 50% reduction in new claims notified.

The value of settled claims arising from Slip/Trip injuries on footpaths to date this

year amounts to €2.4M. This is reflective of the significant increase in the number

of cases which came before the Courts in 2019. The value of settled claims in this

category in 2018 amounted to €1.6M.

It should be noted where repairs to existing footpaths and pavements are carried

out by the Operations & Maintenance (Metropolitan District) Section the quality of

such

repairs

should

not

be

compromised

by

insurance

or

public

liability ‘concerns’.  All such repairs or replacement works carried out must have

regard for the existing street or pavement design as well as the materials used and

the public realm and context.

Specifically in respect of ongoing works on Thomond Bridge the selection of

concrete as a replacement material for the footpaths relates to particular

preventative maintenance action in respect of water ingress & the ongoing impact

of such ingress on the stone arch bridge below. Specifically such measures are

executed in order to protect the bridge from structural damage as a result of such

water ingress in the long term.

Design and Delivery Services endeavour to provide high quality public realm

projects, encompassing both the quality of spaces these projects provide, the

existing context that the projects are within and the material selection to support

the quality of these spaces. An integral part of this design process is to uphold public

health and safety in all projects, including public realm projects; this is paramount.

Building regulation compliance, cyclist / transport / pedestrian policy documents

and Universal Access requirements influence all projects on issues ranging from level

changes, appropriate material selection, colour contrast for visual legibility,

adequate surface water drainage. These policy documents include public safety

measures, and from that perspective, influence urban design of public spaces. From

a practitioner’s perspective, public safety, rather than risk of claims, is always

considered throughout the design and construction of public realm projects.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update of the findings of the audit of community and cultural***

***facilities in Limerick, which was agreed on at the Meeting of Metropolitan District of Limerick on***

***the 21st January 2019.***

**REPLY**:

The audit of Community and Cultural and Arts Facilities involves a comprehensive

questionnaire-based survey of existing facilities across the City and County. The

survey is being conducted in co-operation with the three Local Development

Companies: PAUL Partnership covering the Urban Area, Ballyhoura Development,

East Limerick and West Limerick Resources, West Limerick.

The findings will allow for assessment of needs and will inform the preparation of

the Council’s Strategy for planning and seeking funding for new and/or improved

Community and Cultural and Arts facilities in Local Communities. The findings will

**REPLY:**

The Forward Planning Section propose to commence the review and preparation of

a new Retail Strategy for the Metropolitan Area next year in line with the

**19.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the road improvement works on the Old Dublin Road R445 are***

***the scheme designed by consultant engineers Mott McDonald who were paid 26,866 euro plus***

***VAT in 2016 for the scheme and I will also ask the Council what happened to the Part 8 Planning***

***Submission on this scheme which was supposed to be lodged in May 2017 but has never been***

***lodged to-date.***

**REPLY**:

Mott McDonald, on behalf of Limerick City and County Council, developed a number

of options for road improvement works adjacent to the Gaelscoil Chaladh an Treoigh

entrance on the R445 in 2016. At this time a viable scheme did not progress to Part

8 because of issues arising with some of the lands required to deliver the scheme.

The lands were in private ownership, and at that time funding to progress the

options was unavailable.

To date the following improvements, independent of the Mott McDonald options,

have been progressed:

 Resurfacing of the road pavement between Annacotty Roundabout and Kilmurry

Roundabout due to the condition of the existing road surface;

 Pedestrian access created to Castletroy Town Centre in order to provide a Park

& Stride facility to the Gaelscoil;

 Median barrier from Kilmurry Roundabout heading north to prevent right

turning movements from Chawkes and Lidl onto the R445, which has been

constructed to comply with a condition of planning.
---
9

 The above works focused on improving road safety.

Limerick City and County Council is currently working on a revised scheme for the

R445 from Kilmurry Roundabout to Annacotty Roundabout with support from

adjacent landowners, the National Transport Authority and the Department of

Transport, Tourism and Sport.

We hope to be in a position to present emerging options to the area Councillors

during Q1 of 2020

**20.**

**Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for details of spending on the planning and development of the***

***Northern Distributor Road (both phases) from both its own and from other resources since the***

***inception of the project.***

**REPLY**:

The Limerick Northern Distributor Road (LNDR) will link the N18 Limerick to Ennis

Road with the M7 Limerick to Dublin Motorway. It is being developed as two

schemes: Coonagh to Knockalisheen, which is a Limerick City and County Council

scheme, and Knockalisheen to Annacotty, of which Clare County Council is the lead

authority. Both schemes are being supported by the Department of Transport,

Tourism and Sport (DTTAS).

The Project was initiated in 2010, and Roughan O’Donovan Consulting Engineers

were appointed to undertake the design of the scheme.

The benefits of the LNDR to Limerick and the Mid-West Region will include:

 The unlocking of new industrial and commercial sites.

 Potential to attract new jobs and retain graduates and young people in the

region.

 The reduction in congestion on access routes to Limerick

 Increased competitiveness due to reduction in congestion.

 The reduction of unnecessary through traffic in Limerick city centre, enhancing

the city’s status as the regional capital and premier shopping destination.

 Allowing road space to be re-allocated to improved public transport, cycle and

pedestrian facilities.

 A reduction in journey times and improved access to Limerick city and Shannon

International Airport.

**Coonagh to Knockalisheen**

Phase 1 of the Coonagh to Knockalisheen scheme was substantially completed at

the end of 2018 by the contractor P & D Lydon.

Works include the development of an access road from the Coonagh Roundabout

on the N18 extending eastwards to the rear of Tesco in Coonagh; associated cycle

lanes and footpaths and advance works on the remainder of the route to

Knockalisheen.
---
10

It is anticipated that the Tender documentation for Phase 2 of the Coonagh to

Knockalisheen scheme will be published in December 2019, with construction

commencing in Quarter 2 of 2020 with a construction period of approximately 30

months.

Expenditure to date on the Coonagh to Knockalisheen scheme is set out in the Table

below:

**Total Costs Incurred:**

Consultancy, Utility and Land Purchase

€7,108,831

Contractor costs to date

€10,265,055

**Total Costs:**

**€17,373,886**

**Income Sources to Date:**

€16,195,037

Regeneration

€450,000

Irish Water

€728,849

**Total Income:**

**€17,373,886**

**Knockalisheen to Annacotty**

Clare County Council is the Lead Authority for this element of the LNDR. Roughan

and O’Donovan Consulting Engineers were appointed as design team lead for the

scheme in 2010.

This phase of the scheme is currently at Stage 2 - Project Appraisal stage, which was

submitted in March 2019, and is currently being assessed/reviewed by the

Department.

**21.**

**Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting when Steamboat Quay is expected to be taken in charge by the***

***Council.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council has ongoing engagement with business and

property owners in Steamboat Quay. Due to the complicated nature of the

ownership of the public realm at Steamboat Quay this process is complex and slow

moving. It is difficult to put a timeframe on when these matters will be resolved.

We will endeavour to progress the matter in 2020.

The Steamboat Quay area will be included in the Limerick City and Environs Flood

Relief Scheme which, when advanced, will include for the upgrade of the public

realm in the area.

**22.**

**Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting to please advise on the maximum wait times for all controlled***

***pedestrian crossings in the Metropolitan Area.***
---
11

**REPLY**:

Eighty percent of the traffic signal stock in the Metropolitan area is controlled by the

city’s Adaptive Urban Traffic Control system (AUTC). To minimise congestion the

system collects vehicular traffic flow and demand data, including pedestrian crossing

demand, in real time, and automatically optimises signal timings in response to

changing traffic flows.

In the city centre, junctions operate cycle times in the range of 72 seconds up to 192

seconds if warranted. Within these cycle times the maximum “wait to walk” time is

90 seconds and the shortest is 29 seconds.

Congestion is an expression of traffic density and becomes manifest where traffic

demand is greater than the capacity of a road or the intersections along a road.

Traffic signals provide for:

 Safe and orderly movement of road users.

 Accident reduction.

 Safe pedestrian mobility.

 Increased handling capacity of junctions.

 Reduction of travel delay across the road network.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**23.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council would seek to enhance the***

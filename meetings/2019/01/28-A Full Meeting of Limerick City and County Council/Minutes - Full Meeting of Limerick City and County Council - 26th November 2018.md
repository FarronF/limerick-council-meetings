I will ask at the next Meeting as to the number of properties Limerick City and

within the Metropolitan District, (c) what the maximum rent charged in each of the

Municipalities is, (d) what the maximum charged to those who have migrated from

Total 1, 749

(b) Number of tenanted properties in Metropolitan District : 3,266

(c) There is no maximum rent cap in each of the Municipal Districts

(d) Generally speaking, there is no maximum rent cap in the Municipal Districts or in

O’ Malley Park and Keyes Park have a maximum rent of €60. Category B

properties in Kennedy Park, Carew Park, Ballynanty, Ballinacurra Weston,

I will ask at the next Meeting what was the maximum rent charged to tenants of (a)

the old Limerick County Council, (b) the former City Council, in each of the years

2013 and 2014, and (c) what total rent receipts amounted to for (1) the County area

and (2) the old City Council area, in each of the referenced years.

**REPLY:**

i.

In the years 2013 and 2014, no maximum rent applied in the county area and, in the

city, certain areas has a maximum rent based on the market value of properties.

Category A properties in Watergate Flats, Moyross, St. Mary’s Park, Kincora Park,

O’Malley Park and Keyes Park had a maximum rent of €60. Category B properties in

Kennedy Park, Carew Park, Ballynanty, Ballinacurra Weston, Prospect, Kileely and

Thomandgate had a maximum rent of €90. All other areas in the city outside of

these were not subject to a maximum rent cap.

ii.

The total rent receipts in 2013 amounted to €13,675,114 broken down between city

€7,840,995 and county: €5,834,119. Unfortunately, because of the creation of a new

single authority in 2014, it is not possible to easily provide a comparative

breakdown, but the total receipts for the year for the entire authority area was

€13,747,486.

**9.**

**Questions submitted by Councillor L. Galvin**

I will ask at the next Meeting for a full detailed report on the progress of the

dangerous junctions on the N21 - Wards Cross, Devon Road Cross and others, arising

from the Special Meeting of the Council held on 6th November, 2017.

**REPLY:**

Transport Infrastructure Ireland, through the Mid-West Road Design Office are currently

progressing the engagement of design consultants for works at Devon Cross, Wards Cross

and the cul-de-sac junction west of Wards Cross.

It is anticipated that improvement works will progress on the latter two junctions in 2019.

Devon Cross is likely to take longer, as significant design and construction works, and land

acquisition, will be required.

I will ask at the next Meeting if, and when, Limerick City and County Council has

drawn down the funding from the Department of Housing, provided to this Local

Authority under the Voids Programme.

**REPLY:**

Approval for 70 voids was received in August 2018 from the Department of Housing,

Planning and Local Government (DoHPLG). Under Department of Public Expenditure and

Reform Circular 13/2014, the drawdown of grant funding can only be sought in arrears

(after works are completed and invoices processed for payment). A claim for the first

tranche of funding for 20 units is currently being prepared and will be submitted in the

immediate future to the DoHPLG.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Galvin, Browne, Collins (M), Foley,**

**Scanlan, Sheahan (J)**

We will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to Mr. Michael Ring, T.D.,

Minister for Rural and Community Development, requesting that the townland of

Killoughteen, Newcastle West, which is identified as a structurally weak area in the

County Development Plan, be included in the Clár Programme.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor

Scanlan.

**REPLY:**

The CLÁR programme (Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais) is a targeted

investment programme which provides funding for small scale infrastructural

projects in rural areas that have suffered the greatest levels of population

decline. The aim of CLÁR is to support the sustainable development of

identified CLÁR areas by attracting people to live and work there. The

funding works in conjunction with local funding and on the basis of locally

identified priorities. The scheme is funded by the Department of Rural and

Community Development and delivered, for the most part, by the Local

Authorities in consultation with groups in local communities. The areas

eligible under the programme are determined by the Department of Rural

and Community Development.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan (to be referred to the Home**

**and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

I will move at the next Meeting that an equitable structure of rental payments be

introduced that will apply to all tenants of the Joint Authority from 1st January, 2019,

onwards.

high quality effective Sound Barrier along the Motorway adjacent to the above

Housing Estates to reduce the Motorway noise to an acceptable level within these

residential developments.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Loftus (to be referred to the**

At the outset of the Meeting, the Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Meeting.

The A/Director commenced by referring to the Chief Executive’s Report in relation to the

construction of 6 residential units at Colbert Terrace, Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick. He stated that

extensive consultation had taken place with both the Members and local residents regarding

this proposal. Based on these discussions consideration is being given to reduce the

construction of new residential units in Colbert’s Terrace to four along with the refurbishment

of one existing house fronting onto New Street, Abbeyfeale.

The Members acknowledged the work to date on this matter and welcomed the provision of

new housing. However there was still concern on the density of houses in the area and the

Members also referred to the existing derelict houses on Colbert Terrace. Discussion also took

place on the need for car parking in the area and for the housing scheme to be reduced to

three to allow for the area designated to the fourth house to be used for parking. The need

for parking for the Medical Centre in particular, the width of the roadway and the upgrading

of public lightning and drainage.

Following further discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor

Foley that the following items be addressed:

 Provision of additional car parking spaces on Colbert Terrace as required by the

Medical Centre

 The width of roadway to be 6 meters where possible

 The width of footpath to be considered

 The requirement for a Loading bay for businesses on Colbert Terrace

 The need for public lighting and drainage upgrades at Colbert Terrace

In response, the A/Director stated that these items can be addressed by the Council under

the Roads Act 1994 and by the detailed design for the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan.

The Meeting today was with regard to the proposed Part VIII for the construction of houses

at Colbert Terrace. The Director also noted the funding sources for the proposed works and

the requirement to ensure value for money and also stated that the derelict properties at

Colbert Terrace are being dealt with under the appropriate legislation as they are not in

Council ownership.

Following further discussion, it was agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report be adopted

subject to the following amendment:

 The provision of three no. three bedroomed houses instead of six at Colbert Terrace,

Abbeyfeale along with the refurbishment of one existing house fronting onto New St.,

To receive presentation on the Options Report for Fuller’s Folly,

The Business Development Manager, Shannon International, gave a presentation to Members

on the Options Report for Fuller’s Folly, Newcastle West, which identified key

recommendations for the building.

He also outlined the opportunities for the development of Fuller’s Folly which include being

on a major tourism route, and being next to the Desmond Hall which attracts over 15,000+

visitors per annum. He also referred to the constraints of the building, which include not

being physically connected to the Desmond Hall, the Folly itself being of low visibility when

arriving in Newcastle West and the small physical space within the building.

On conclusion, he stated that a Tourism Orientation Hub would be the most appropriate

option at this time for the building and with a “Pop-Up” Tourism Information Office, which

could be open for the 2019 tourism season.

In response the Cathaoirleach and Members thanked the Business Development Manager,

Shannon International, for the presentation and supported the idea of a tourism hub. The

Director stated that the development of this Hub could be further explored with

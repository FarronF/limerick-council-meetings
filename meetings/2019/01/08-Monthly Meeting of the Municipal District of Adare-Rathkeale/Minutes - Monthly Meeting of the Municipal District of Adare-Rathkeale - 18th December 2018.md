At the outset of the Meeting Councillor Teskey expressed dismay and anger at the

proposals of Minister Shane Ross to increase fines and penalty points for speeding and

for non-carrying of a drivers licence. Councillor Teskey called on the Taoiseach Leo

Varadkar to consider the position of Minister Ross saying these proposals were a direct

attack on the people of rural Ireland. This proposal was seconded by Councillor

Sheahan. All Members were in agreement with Councillor Teskey’s sentiments and it

was agreed the Taoiseach and Micheál Martin be contacted on the matter. It was

further agreed to circulate this motion to all Local Authorities for support on the matter.

The Cathaoirleach informed Members he would have to leave the Meeting early and

Councillor Keary agreed to chair the Meeting in his absence. It was also agreed that

Items 12 and 13 would be taken first.

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of motion received from Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next meeting that this Council update our district regarding the**

**delayed time frame that was occured during the recent rent review process. In**---
2

**particular how it took up to 14 months for people to learn of their newly calculated**

**rent.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor McMahon.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey expressed his concern in relation to the

amount of arrears added to a tenants rent account due to the slow progress in which

rent reviews are managed by the Housing Support Department. Councillor McMahon

felt a rota system should be introduced to deal with the rent review process. Councillor

Sheahan was disappointed that a member of staff from the Housing Support Services

was not present at the Meeting to discuss the Motion.

**Reply:**

In June 2017, the Council commenced a process of seeking completed rent assessment

forms from in excess of 5000 tenants city and countywide. The purpose of this exercise

was to get an up to date picture of income and household composition of all tenancies,

and seek to ensure that tenants were being charged a rent in accordance with the

Council’s Differential Rents Scheme. This was a challenging administrative task and, with

limited resources available to undertake same, it was inevitable that there would be a

significant time lag in notifying some tenants of revisions arising from the new

information submitted. In quite a number of cases, the Council had to seek further

clarification and supporting documentation in order to correctly assess the household

rent. This has proven to be a slow process. In fact, there are still a small minority of cases

where responses are still awaited, despite repeated reminders being issued.

In relation to some tenancies, it emerged through this process that the household was in

receipt of some income that had not been declared to the Council, as is required under

the terms of Letting Agreements signed. This may have given rise to an increased weekly

rent and arrears outstanding. With regard to the latter, there was a recognition that it

may not always be practical to pay same in one lump sum- although some chose to do

that – and, therefore, the Council indicated its willingness to be as flexible as possible in

agreeing individual payment plans, taking due cognisance of each household’s particular

circumstances. Acceptable payment plans have been agreed in the vast majority of

cases.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next meeting that this district carry out a survey to accertain the**

**current structural condition of the slip roads off the N21 with a particular focus on the**

**entrances and exits to the town of Rathkeale.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor Keary.---

repairs, drainage and verge reinstatement. The works are scheduled to be carried out in Q1

2019.

**QUESTIONS**

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next meeting why it is necessary to request information from**

**pensioners on an annual basis with regard to their bin waiver.**

**REPLY:**

The current qualifying criteria for the Household Waste Subsidy Scheme are

as follows:

Applicant must be of pension age i.e. 66 years old or over.

Applicant(s) must be in receipt of a State Contributory/Non Contributory Pension/Widows

(ers) Pension **onl**y.

Applicant must be living alone and in receipt of a living alone allowance or with a

spouse/partner who also qualifies.---
6

**Or**

Applicant must be in receipt of Disability Allowance & living (i) alone (ii) with a qualifying

OAP (iii) with a person in receipt of Disability Allowance **or** (iv) with dependents without

income

Persons/households in receipt of any other income other than the above listed Social

Welfare pensions or allowance will not be eligible

In order to determine if persons qualify for the scheme they must submit their income

details on an annual basis, as they may no longer be eligible to receive a subsidy. The

following are the reasons why a person may become ineligible



A person may be in receipt of Carer’s Allowance which would make them ineligible



A household member may reach the age of 18 and be in receipt of Income other

than Disability Allowance which would make them ineligible



A person over 18 (Partner, son, daughter etc.) may move into the property who is in

receipt of any other income than the above.



A person may not have declared that they are in receipt of a private pension (which

would make them ineligible) on a previous application.



A partner/spouse may have passed away and in this case we would need proof that

the applicant is in receipt of Living Alone Allowance



A member of the household may have taken up employment since

Limerick City and County Council has an obligation as a public body to ensure it meets the

highest standards of Corporate Governance and taxpayer’s money is spent wisely.

The Local Government Auditor carries out an audit on the Council’s services on a yearly

basis and in order to ensure compliance, the Local Authority needs to show that each

household that is approved for a waiver qualifies under the terms and conditions of the

scheme.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next meeting for clarification on the time scale in getting public**

**lights fixed.**

**REPLY:**

The Operation and Maintenance contract currently in place with SSE Airtricity

requires the contractor to repair public lights within 10 working days from

the date faults are reported.---

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**11.**

**Notice of motion received from Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will move at the next meeting, that an update be sought from the Department of**

**Rural and Community Development on the proposal to improve the surface of the Slí**

**na Sláinte route on the Askeaton Bypass.**

In proposing the Motion Councillor Sheahan requested a member of staff from Design

and Delivery Services present a report at the January Meeting detailing the full costing

of works to be carried out. He also requested a report detailing the full costing of works

required to complete the unfinished works at the Beer Garden to Kildimo. This was

seconded by Councillor Keary.

**Correspondence**

**15.**

**A.O.B**

 Councillor O’Brien requested the issue of the footpath from the Beer Garden to

Kildimo be put back on to the Agenda going forward as he feels the pathway is

neglected and the response previously received is dismissive.

 Councillor Sheahan requested a report be made available to Members at the

January Meeting in relation to works to be carried out in Asgard Cove, Loughill.

 Councillor McMahon expressed her anger in relation to the way Irish Water have

left two houses in Moyreen and Monamohill Ballyhahill without water on a

continuous basis. There are no running showers or toilets and have not been

issued with a supply of bottled water. On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan

and seconded by Councillor Keary action is needed from Irish Water and should

be sought by the Chief Executive on a daily basis until the issue is resolved.

 Councillor O’Brien requested a member of staff look into the issue of drainage

from Slatterys Pub to Kildimo National School, as large puddles are forming and

ponding the road.

 Councillor Sheahan requested footpaths from the Lantern Lodge roundabout to

the Woodlands Hotel and also footpaths from the new roundabout to the village

of Adare need to be considered during constrution of the Adare bypass.---

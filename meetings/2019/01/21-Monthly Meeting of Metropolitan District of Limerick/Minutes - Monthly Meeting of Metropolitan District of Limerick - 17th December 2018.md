21, Question submitted by Councillor S.Lynch

| will ask at the next meeting how many rough sleepers do we have on our streets compared to
last year

REPLY: Limerick currently does not have known bedded down rough sleepers. Temporary
Emergency Provision (TEP) has adequately accommodated those at risk of rough
sleeping.

specifically target those at risk of rough sleeping and provide accommodation
with wrap around supports from the Local Authority, the AHB sector.

12. Question submitted by Councillor S. Lynch

| will ask at the next meeting can the idea of a night shelter between the months of November
and March be re visited once again.

REPLY: Currently Limerick City & County Council provide a Temporary Emergency Provision
(TEP) Service which delivers accommodation to those who find themselves
homeless. The accommodation is currently provided all year round and has
capacity to meet the needs of both male and female service users avoiding the
need for rough sleeping for those who avail of accommodation. Strategically, we
are working with all service users to remove the need for such a facility going
forward, however, TEP Provision currently form a vital part of homeless
infrastructure in Limerick.

13. Question submitted by Councillor M. Mc Creesh

| will ask at the next meeting, in the Service Delivery Plan 2019 under the National Regional
Shared Services Directorate, outlining the service delivery objective for the principal service of
Building Control, the performance standard for ‘Risk based programme of Building Control
Inspections’ states % of new builds inspected equal to or greater than national target of 12-15%

14. Question submitted by Cmhir. S. 6 Ceallaigh

| will ask at the next meeting how many Council built houses were built in 2018 and how many
houses were knocked in 2018

REPLY: Limerick City and County Council built 45 houses in 2018 as at 12'* December 2018.
A further 19 are nearing completion.
2 No. Houses were demolished in 2018.

15. Question submitted by Cmhir. 6 Ceallaigh

1 will ask at the next meeting if there has been any further consideration by Til in relation to
adding Castleconnell to signage on the M7 at junction 27 at Birdhill.

REPLY: The addition of Castleconnell as a destination to be signed at Junction 27 (Birdhill)
to Southbound traffic on the M7 would necessitate the modification of
approximately 13 signs on the M7 itself, the R454 Link road to Birdhill and on the
R445 Old Dublin road. If any sign faces need to be increased in size, then there
could also be additional cost implications, should the existing posts or foundations
need to be upgraded. The cost of the changes to the signage and the associated
traffic management costs, particularly on high-speed roads, would be prohibitive
and unlikely to be funded by Til.

16. Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

| will ask at the next meeting what plans are in place for the construction of a pedestrian tunnel
at the dangerous railway bridge in Rhebogue.

REPLY: Limerick City and County Council and Irish Rail previously carried out a preliminary
study, in advance of the Smarter Travel works in Rhebogue, to look at the feasibility
of providing 2 pedestrian walkway to the side of the existing railway bridge.

From a preliminary examination, the provision of a pedestrian walkway is feasible,
however the estimated cost is in the order of €400,000 to €500,000 and some
additional land would have to be acquired to facilitate the proposal.

Further examination did not proceed at the time due to funding constraints, and
other traffic calming works were provided in the Rhebogue area. The Council
proposes to examine the provision of a pedestrian walkway now, under the

NOTI MOTION

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan

! will move at the next meeting that this Council request the Minister to ban all domestic single
use batteries and replace them with rechargeable ones.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

Irish legislation on batteries is based on the EU Batteries Directive, which intends to contribute to
the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment by minimising
the negative impact of batteries and accumulators (rechargeable batteries) and waste batteries
and accumulators. It also ensures the smooth functioning of the internal market by harmonising
requirements as regards the placing on the market of batteries and accumulators.

To achieve these objectives, the legislation prohibits the marketing of batteries containing some
hazardous substances, defines measures to establish schemes aiming at high level of collection
and recycling, and fixes targets for collection and recycling activities. The Directive also sets out
provisions on labelling of batteries and their ability to be removed from equipment.

It also aims to improve the environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle
of batteries and accumulators, e.g. producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those
operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators.
Producers of batteries and accumulators, and producers of other products incorporating a battery
or accumulator, are given responsibility for the waste management of batteries and accumulators
that they place on the market.

Article 6 of the Batteries Directive explicitly prohibits Member States from impeding, prohibiting,
or restricting the placing on the market in their territory of batteries and accumulators that meet
the requirements of the Directive. Therefore, it is not legally possible for a Member State to
unilaterally place any further barriers or bans on the marketing of batteries that meet the
requirements of the Directive.

The Batteries Directive is currently being reviewed, as the Commission assesses whether the
Directive continues to meet its objectives and contributes to the general objectives of EU
environmental policy. For its part, Ireland has exceeded the collection, recycling and recovery
targets laid down by the Directive, with a 52% collection rate for portable batteries achieved in
2017. This compares favourably with the collection target, which was set at 45%.

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan (to be referred to the Environment
Strategic Policy Committee)

! will move at the next meeting that this Council immediately re-act local bye-laws making all
refuse collectors charge customers on a pay by weight basis.

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

20. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas

| will move at the next meeting that the Council lodge a Part 8 planning application as soon as
possible for the proposed road widening scheme to upgrade Lower Golf Links Road near O’Sheas
pub now that the topographical and hydrographic surveys have been completed and
consultants have been appointed.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Leddin

Reply:

The Council has appointed consultants for the upgrade of the Golf Links Road, which involves road
works on Golf Links Road and Old Ballysimon Road. Surveys and investigations are ongoing and
the Consultants are preparing a flood study report and undertaking a conservation study on the
existing bridge, which is a protected structure. The project is a priority and it is scheduled to
submit Part 8 in Q1 2019.

21. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (to be referred to the Home and
Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council re-evaluate the housing
strategy for Ballinacurra Weston and Prospect so that clarity can be provided to residents in
terms of housing upgrades, new builds, new road and demolitions.

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Home and Social Development Strategic Policy
Committee.

22. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond

! will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council seek funding from
Transport Infrastructure Ireland to carry out road improvements to include street lighting,
footpaths, and other safety measures and also to improve sight lines for vehicles entering and
exiting onto N24.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Pond and seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon

A/Senior Executive Officer, Physical Development confirmed that Limerick City & County Council
will arrange to contact Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TIl) to discuss these representations. Mr
Mc Guigan stated that he will ask them to work with the Roads Engineers of Limerick City and
County Council, to examine the issues raised, and to establish what remedial measures are
warranted and can be funded by TIl at this time. Mr McGuigan confirmed that he will revert to
the Members in the District with the response from TI.

23. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler

initiative to be implemented in Limerick Fire and Rescue who are currently fully trained in this.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Hogan.

Reply:

The Fire Service has statutory responsibility for dealing with fires and rescues and any
additional work taken on cannot take from this statutory responsibility.

The statutory responsibility for responding to Cardiac Emergencies and other medical
emergencies lies with the Health Service Executive (HSE). Currently, if requested by the HSE,
the Fire Service will assist (when available) with medical emergencies and has done so ona
number of occasions in Limerick. The HSE has not requested the Council to consider the
introduction of such a service. To implement such arrangements matters such as staffing,
equipment, training, policies, procedures, medical insurance, governance, etc. would have to
be considered and agreed prior to any roll out of an automatic response from the Fire Service
to medical calls. Undoubtedly if the Fire Service were to formally take on such a role it would
entail additional costs. No budgetary provision has been made for the provision of such a
service in 2019. | recommend that the Council await a formal request from the HSE to
consider the provision of such a service before making a decision on this matter.

24. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond

! will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council priorities the process of
delivering a new Greenway in Castletroy linking Castletroy College to the Gael Scoil and on to
Castletroy Shopping Centre so that school children can cycle and walk between schools safely.
In addition to this | would ask that the proposed roundabout on the R445 giving improved access
to the Gael Scoil be prioritized.

On the proposal of Councillor Pond and seconded by Councillor Secas

A/Senior Executive Officer, Physical Development advised that following representations from the
Members, a team has been appointed to look at the provision of a Greenway linking Castletroy
College, Castletroy Gael Scoil and Castletroy Town Centre as set out in the Castletroy
Development Plan. Funding for the plan for the proposed Greenway is being provided by the
National Transport Authority. Mr McGuigan Preliminary plans are now being prepared and
consultation and discussion will be arranged with the District Members in January 2019.

25. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Cahillane

1 will move at the next meeting if the Council can, as a matter of urgency, write to the Minister
for Health, Simon Harris and the HSE Director General, John Connaghan and request that they
grant the right of ambulance staff (including paramedics, advanced paramedics and emergency
medical technicians) to be represented by the trade union of their choice.

This is relevant to us and our constituents as a majority of EMTs and paramedics in Limerick are
members of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (NASRA) and
Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) and have been denied recognition by the HSE. A one day

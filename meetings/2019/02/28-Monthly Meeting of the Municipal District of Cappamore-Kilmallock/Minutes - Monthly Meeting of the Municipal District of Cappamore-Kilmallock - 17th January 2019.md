The Cathaoirleach welcomed Sgt Bernie Leetch, Crime Prevention Officer, Henry St Garda
Station, Limerick to the meeting.

Sgt Leetch gave a presentation to the Elected Members on rural isolation and crime
prevention. She outlined her experience with An Garda Siochana as the Crime Prevention
Officer for Limerick City and County and her role in crime prevention and stopping people
becoming victims of crime. She confirmed that she was happy to meet with any groups, large
or small, in the Municipal District to advise them on the various measures that individuals and
local communities can put in place to prevent crimes happening to them or in their areas. She
outlined measures that householders could put in place to deter burglaries and theft including
using light timers in their homes, ensuring doors and windows were secure at all times, the
use of sensor lights, having a monitored alarm system in place, and other such measures.

Sgt Leetch also referred to various scams that were reported to her and stressed the
importance of people being vigilant to scam e-mails or phone calls. She also stressed the
importance of people notifying Gardai of any attempted scams so that these details could be
made available to the wider public to counteract any reoccurrence of a scam if possible.

Sgt Leetch gave details of an event taking place on the 12" February, 2019 in The Old Convent,
Bruff titled “Rural Isolation and Crime Prevention. This event, she explained, is aimed at
people living in rural communities and helping them to address crime prevention and mental
health issues. Topics for discussion on the night included crime prevention, personal safety
advice, wintertime burglary prevention, farm theft, personal wellness, and rural isolation. In
addition to Sgt Leetch, a number of other guest speakers on the night will give presentations
on rural isolation and overall wellbeing.

The Members thanked Sgt Leetch for her presentation and acknowledged the work being
done by the Crime Prevention Office in raising awareness of these issues amongst the general
public. They agreed that it was important that the public remain vigilant in relation to
protecting their homes and property. They also agreed that scams were a constant concern,
many scams were often quite sophisticated, and the public needed to be aware of what scams
were out there.

The Members agreed that social media was also an issue and that the public needed to be
mindful of what they posted on social media which might indicate, for example, that they
were away on holidays thereby suggesting that the family home may be unoccupied. The
Members agreed to circulate the details of the event in Bruff and agreed that it was an
important event to raise awareness of rural isolation and crime prevention.

The Superintendent referred to increased liaison between An Garda Siochana and Limerick
City & County Council whereby Exclusion Orders had been served on tenants of local authority
housing under Housing Legislation. He confirmed that this was an important measure in
dealing with individuals who were residing in a local authority tenancy and who were involved
in anti-social behaviour within the local community.

He confirmed that Sgt Ted O'Riordan had been appointed as a Detective Sergeant in the Bruff
District and that this was the first time that a Detective Sergeant was appointed in the Bruff
District. He also confirmed that Sgt Tadhg Reeves had been appointed to the District, along
with Garda Trevor McGrath.

The Members welcomed the update on crime statistics and the new appointments to the
District. They also welcomed the appointment of the first Detective Sergeant in the Bruff
District, which they noted was a milestone for the District. The Members acknowledged the
fact that there was increased co-operation between the Gardai and Limerick City & County
Council in tackling problematic tenants in local authority housing. The Members also
welcomed the fact that, under the Councils 2019 Budget, that additional funding was being
provided for extra tenancy enforcement staff to work in the area of social housing tenancy
support and enforcement.

The Members referred to the problems with break-ins to cars and especially when this
occurred at graveyards or during mass times, etc. when people were especially vulnerable.
The Members agreed that ongoing vigilance was needed to deal with this issue and the
importance of improved contacts between those communities and An Garda Siochana.

The Members acknowledged the overall work done by An Garda Siochana in the District and
they congratulated Garda Kieran Lees from Caherconlish Garda Station who was part of the
Garda team that came fourth in the European Police Championship Marathon which was held
in Dublin in October, 2018. They also congratulated Garda John Hennessy, who is from
Kilmallock, but based in Tipperary Town, who was being presented with a Municipal District
award later that evening in recognition of the two National Bravery Awards he had received
because of his work with An Garda Siochana.

The Members also referred to issues in relation to the speed of traffic, especially in towns and
villages in the Municipal District area. The Superintendent confirmed that he would advise
the Garda Traffic Corps if a particular area of the District was identified by the Members as
requiring additional enforcement measures.

This concluded the Meeting.

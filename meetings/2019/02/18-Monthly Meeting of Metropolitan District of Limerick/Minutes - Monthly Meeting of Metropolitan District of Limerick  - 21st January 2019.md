various provisions of the Litter Pollution Act/ Waste Management Acts and the
Waste Presentation Bye Laws. It involves the Domestic Waste and Litter, Street

Area Offices and other stakeholders including Community/Tidy Towns
Groups/Residents’ Associations and businesses.

A similar level of operations is expected in 2019 as the Council addresses the
ongoing challenges of: casual littering/indiscriminate deposit of household
rubbish, the lack of evidence recovered, the operations of unpermitted waste
collectors and increasing number of households availing of approved refuse

16. Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin

1 will ask at the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council have considered undertaking
a regional recycling awareness campaign in our public buildings, on street and in shopping
centres to help improve the public’s knowledge on what can and cannot be recycled so as to
improve our recycling rates and protect our environment.

REPLY: Limerick City and County Council is committed to managing waste correctly as outlined in
the Southern Regional Waste Management Plan 2015-2021. The following targets are outlined in
the plan.

e 1% reduction Per Annum in the Quantity of Household Waste Generated per Capita over
the period of the Plan. (prevention)

e Recycling Achieving a Recycling Rate of 50% of Managed Municipal Waste by
2020(Recycling)

e Landfill Reduce to 0% the Direct Disposal of Unprocessed Residual Municipal Waste to
Landfill (from 2016 onwards) in favour of Higher Value Pre-treatment Processes and
Indigenous Recovery Practices.

The Council’s environment awareness officer works closely with the southern regional waste
management offices on awareness campaigns and assists in the rollout of national and regional
campaigns locally.

The latest national campaign is mywaste.ie this is a new online service designed as the one-stop-
shop for all matters relating to domestic waste and recycling. It was launched by Ireland’s three
regional waste management offices (Eastern/Midlands, Southern, Connacht/Ulster) in December
2018.

Mywaste.ie- is the ultimate information point for all questions relating to the segregation of
household waste. This definitive waste management resource will help the public in addressing
the need to manage waste and protect the environment. The Department of Communications,
Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) sponsored site is also designed to help progress
lreland’s waste targets. This includes a targeted household recycling and reuse rate of 65% by
2035.

The National site aims to remove any confusion relating to “What to do” and Where to Go” with
items, while also providing information on “Why” it is important to be responsible with waste.
We will be hearing much more about it during 2019.

Reply: Arising from the increased number of requests to provide funding, facilities or sites
for community and cultural facilities throughout Limerick it is recommended that
as a first step an audit of existing facilities be conducted. This audit would identify
the existing provision of facilities across Limerick City and County and inform a
strategy that would seek to ascertain future needs.

In proposing the Motion, Clir Secas outlined the need for a multipurpose complex that will serve
the needs of the community and to take account of the needs of the large population centre.

A discussion took place where some Members felt that a review of existing community space
within the area needs to be undertaken first to determine the level and usage of current space.
Cllr Secas welcomed the discussion and looked forward to the findings of the audit.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.

20. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan

1 will move that Limerick City and County Council provide an update on progress regarding the

for community and cultural facilities throughout Limerick it is recommended that
as a first step an audit of existing facilities be conducted. This audit would identify
the existing provision of facilities across Limerick City and County and inform a
strategy that would seek to ascertain future needs. It is the intention of the Social
Development Directorate to commence work on this in the first quarter of 2019.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Hogan welcomed the audit and queried with the Executive
the timeframe for completion date of the audit.

This Motion was seconded by Councillor Hurley.

Following a discussion regarding Notices of motion No. 19 & 20, Director, Social Development, Mr.
G Daly confirmed to Members that an audit will be carried out and an evidence based approach
was required to determine if these facilities were required as well as the preparation of an
inventory of existing facilities and the correct usage of the facilities.

On the proposal of Councillor K. O’Hanlon and seconded by Councillor F. Daly it was suggested
that the Local Authority engage with the Elected Members and members of the public in
identifying the needs and requirements of the community in relation to this audit.

21. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Daly (To be referred to the Cultural Strategic

Policy Committee)

| will move at the next meeting to have the theme of our St. Patrick’s Day Parade be designated
as commemorating the centenary of the Limerick Soviet. The celebrations planned by Trade
Unions this year all surround the fight that workers took to have clear passage to their
workplaces’ without hindrance from the Military forces in our City at that time. It is forgotten
time in our City’s History and we need to have the celebrations highlighted as much as possible.

This motion has been referred to the Cultural Strategic Policy Committee.

22. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond

Following ongoing anti-social behaviour in Annacotty, Castletroy, Castleconnell areas and the
appointment of a new permanent Garda Sergeant to Castleconnell Garda Station providing
cover to Annacotty, Castletroy and Castleconnell areas, | move that Limerick City and County
Council would engage with the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner to obtain the
necessary funding to allow the Castleconnell Garda Station to open 24 hours daily to serve the
needs of this vast area.

In proposing this Motion Councillor J. Pond acknowledged the appointment of the Garda Sergeant
to Castleconnell but emphasised the importance of having the Castleconnell Garda Station

Policing Committee.

23. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley

| will move at the next meeting that a definite date be given for a roundabout to be put in place
close to Castlecabin on the R445, (between Kilmurry and Annacotty Roundabouts) following
collaborative talks between local developer Alber Homes and Council Executives.

Reply: At this time it is not possible to put an absolute date for a roundabout junction to
be put in place at this location on the R445, as this project is still at a preliminary
phase, and discussions are ongoing with landowners. Any firm proposals emerging
from these discussions will be subject to planning consent, road safety audit and
provision of adequate funding.

In proposing this Motion, Councillor M. Hurley referred to the need for collaboration in order for
the roundabout to be put in place. This Motion was seconded by Councillor M. Sheahan and
agreed.

24. Notice of Motion submitted by Councilor M. Hurley

| will move at the January Metropolitan Meeting that consideration be given to extending the
footpath from the Georgian Village to turn to Donoughmore National School. This facility is long
overdue for schoolchildren and residents alike.

Reply: The existing footpath terminates at Ros Mor Estate on the eastern side of Regional
Road R512 approximately 750m away from the Donoughmore Junction. This a busy
Regional Road and the lands between the Donoughmore Junction and Ros Mor
Estate are zoned Agriculture in the Southern Environs Plan.

Donoughmore National School is a further 600m away from Regional Road R512 to
the west along a narrow Local Road L5109.

The Council recognise that Donoughmore National School is located 1.35km away
from the existing footpath at Ros Mor Estate.

However, this is an unserviced Rural Area and extending the footpath as proposed,
which would require land acquisition, would involve significant expenditure
outside the zoned built up area of the City Environs.

This Motion was proposed by Councillor M. Hurley and seconded by Councillor J. Sheahan

It was proposed by Councillor J. Leddin and seconded by Councillor S. Lynch to suspend Standing
Orders for 10 minutes in order to complete the Agenda.

25. Notice of Motion submi b uncillor J. Leddin

1 will move that Limerick City and County Council undertake a review of the timeframe between
the ending of one tenancy and the re-letting of the house under a new tenancy so as to reduce
the number of unoccupied council owned houses.

REPLY: The Service Operations Section are currently working on a review of both the
timeframe associated with reletting properties and the resourcing of this
operation. The turnaround of housing stock for new Tenants is a priority for the
Service Operations Directorate in 2019.

In proposing this Motion, Councillor J. Leddin expressed dissatisfaction at the timeframe with the
reletting of properties and the time that it takes for the repairs to be carried out. This Motion was
seconded by Councillor E. Secas.

Following discussion by the Members on the timeframe associated with the reletting of

properties, Director, Service Operations, Mr. K. Lehane noted Members comments and confirmed
that vacant properties in need of repair will be a priority for 2019.

Note of Motion referred from Metropolitan District of Limerick (21st January

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F.Daly (To be referred to Cultural**

**Strategic Policy Committee)**

I will move at the next meeting to have the theme of our St. Patrick’s Day

Parade be designated as commemorating the centenary of the Limerick Soviet.

The celebrations planned by Trade Unions this year all surround the fight that

workers took to have clear passage to their workplace’s without hindrance---
from the Military forces in our City at that time. It is a forgotten time in our

City’s History and we need to have the celebrations highlighted as much as

possible.

**Item 10.**

there is any update on plans to enhance/decorate the Municipal and Utility

Boxes in the Metropolitan Area?

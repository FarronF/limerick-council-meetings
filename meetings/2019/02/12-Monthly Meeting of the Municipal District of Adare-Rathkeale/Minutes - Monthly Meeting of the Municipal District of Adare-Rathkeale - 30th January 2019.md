Members three locations were considered in the vicinity of the current Adare Junction

and the best location was selected.

matter with individual Party Leaders.

The Members acknowledged that they had no role in staffing matters but expressed

their disappointment in relation to the impending departure of the A/Senior Executive

Engineer, Kevin Murphy. They praised Mr. Murphy for his dedication and work.

Councillor Teskey proposed that this transfer, along with the changes to the Municipal

District and Operational Areas would be extended to the 24th of May to coincide with

the new elected Councillors. This was seconded by Councillor Keary.

The Director advised Members she would bring their concerns back to the Chief

Executive, however, she reminded the members that they had previously requested that

operational areas be brought in line with District areas and that the turn over in staff in

the District be contained. Director Curley while acknowledging that staff changes will

always happen the appointment of a permanent Senior Executive Engineer should mean

less staff movement.

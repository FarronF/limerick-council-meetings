**Item 2**

**To consider Notice of Motion referred from full Council meeting on the 23rd**

**July, 2018:**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. A. Teskey:**

***‘I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council review***

***its schedule of development levies so as to ensure that such charges apply***

***exclusively to new build scenarios’*.**

In reply to queries regarding payment of contributions M. Woods, clarified what the

development contribution scheme states in relation to change of use applications i.e.---
‘’where a contribution was paid previously for the existing use, the development shall

be exempt from paying a contribution’ and in relation to replacement applications it

sates the “contribution will be charged on any additional floor area”.

Charging contributions for retention applications is in line with the Department’s

Section 28 guidelines that state no exemption or waiver should apply to applications

for retention of development. She also indicated that if the contribution scheme

applied exclusively to new build that the cost of new build would have to increase to

offset for the loss as over 19% of the planning permissions in 2017 and 2018 were

either change of use, retention or replacement developments.

Members were advised to contact the executive in individual cases as appropriate.

The Director of Service, Economic Development stated that the matter would be kept

under review.

**Item 3**

**Presentation by Failte Ireland on Limerick Initiatives**

The Chairperson welcomed Miriam Kennedy, Head of Wild Atlantic Way, Failte

Ireland along with her colleagues Siobhan King and Margaret Jenkins.

The Wild Atlantic Way was launched in 2014 stretching 2,500km from the Inishowen

Peninsula in Co. Donegal to Kinsale in West Cork. Earlier this year, all of Limerick

was designated as part of the WAW region. The WAW has been described as the

economic engine for the west of Ireland. 2018 has been a record year for the WAW

in terms of both tourist numbers and tourist spend.

In 2017, there was an estimated 68,000 overseas and 284,000 domestic trips made

to Limerick with a combined spend of €300 million. The main tourist attractions for

Limerick included:

 King John’s Castle

 Limerick City Gallery of Art

 Foynes Flying Boat Musem

 Frank McCourt Museum

resulting in a spend of €300m (4th highest in the WAW region)

Members were informed that both Limerick and Killarney were included in a pilot

project over the next three years and were being designated as WAW Gateway

towns, whereby tourists would base themselves to explore the WAW and encourage

growing tourism in the area.

The Shannon Estuary Drive was the first of 10 Looped Drives to be included in the

WAW. It is a Looped Route of approx. 207km. Failte Ireland works closely with

West Limerick Resources and the Clare Development Company assisting

businesses in promoting the visitor attractions on route.

Failte Ireland are developing 5 Visitor Experience Development Plans from

Inishowen to Kinsale. VEDP’s are a 5 year commercial development plan for a

region which will unlock the economic growth potential for the area.

Failte Ireland Plans for 2019 include:

 3 Small Grants Schemes

 4 Looped Drives

 9 VEDPs---
 1,000 Business Supports

 500 Key account meetings

 3 Master Plans for Signature Points.

Members were informed that the next call for Capital Grants would be Q2 in 2019

and a framework would be drawn up regarding same.

While members welcomed the presentation, they queried why the Hunt Museum was

not included in the visitor attractions and were informed that numbers were not made

available for this venue.

A number of members expressed concern that Limerick City and County Council had

invested a large sum in the promotion of Limerick over the last 4/5 years and queried

how Limerick was being promoted by Failte Ireland. They were informed that

Limerick was being promoted as a business tourism destination and that the

designation of Gateway City will encourage leisure also. Limerick is at a very early

stage of development process and a lot of work needs to be carried out and Failte

Ireland are willing to continue working with the Local Authority in promoting Limerick

as a tourist destination and to assist in funding such developments.

In response to queries regarding the tourist potential of Adare, it was confirmed that

Failte Ireland was working with the Council and the local business interests to

promote the Adare area.

Further investment and support for Shannon Airport was sought by the members.

Members also urged for greater support for the development and marketing of

Limerick’s Greenways.

Standing Orders were adjourned to allow for consideration of Items 4 and 5.

**Item 4**

**To receive a presentation on the final draft Limerick tourism Development**

**Strategy**

Gordon Daly informed members that the main amendment to the Final Draft of

Limerick Tourism Development Strategy was the addition of an Action Plan as part of

the document. He stated that the Action Plan (16 specific actions) will be the main

reference point to measure against.

Members were informed promotional material for Limerick City and County was

currently being reviewed and that this would take into consideration the use of a

Tourist App.

On the proposition of Cllr. O’Dea, seconded by Stephen Keary, it was recommended

that Limerick Tourism Development Strategy Action Plan 2019-2023 will partner and

collaborate with the Sporting Limerick website and include content from the Sporting

Limerick website on the Limerick.ie platform in order to achieve the objective 3.0

(unlocking the potential) of the above mentioned Action Plan.---
On the proposition of Cllr. O’Dea, seconded by Cllr. Eleanora Hogan it was

unanimously agreed that the SPC recommend the adoption of the Final Draft

Limerick Tourism Development Strategy at the Full Council meeting in January,

2019.

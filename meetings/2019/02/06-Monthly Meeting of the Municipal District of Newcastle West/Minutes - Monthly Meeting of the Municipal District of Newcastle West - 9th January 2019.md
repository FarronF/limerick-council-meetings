There are outstanding works in this estate which need to be completed to

bring the estate to a taking in charge standard. The Council has engaged with

the developer and has also lodged a claim against the planning bond in order

to have these works carried out. We will continue to pursue both of these

avenues in order to have the estate completed.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that a safety survey be carried out along the R520 between***

***the Kerry Co-Op premises and Clooneyskehane in the interest of pedestrian safety.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that there are a number of houses at this

location and that a footpath is required in the interest of pedestrian safety.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan

REPLY:

A safety audit and a costing for the provision of a footpath, piping a

stream/culvert, public lighting and drainage in the above mentioned area was

carried out and it was estimated that works would be in the region of

€130,000.

The length of footpath necessary to the last house is 500m approximately.

There are only 7 houses to be serviced by the requested footpath. This would

result in a cost of €18,580 per house to bring a footpath out this road.

Therefore based on the above, this project is a cost prohibitive project.---

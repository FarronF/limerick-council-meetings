The Cathaoirleach welcomed Anne Goggin, Senior Executive Engineer, Physical Development
Directorate to the meeting. Ms Goggin gave a presentation to the Elected Members on the
operation of the Maigue River Trust and explained that it was a company limited by guarantee
and a registered charity. The Trust was established following a significant fish kill in the River
Loobagh in 2014, and has nine Directors drawn from a range of sectors representing the three
pillars of sustainability: Social, Economic and Environmental. She confirmed that the Trusts
mission is to protect, enhance and cherish the rivers and lakes of the Maigue catchment for
the benefit and enjoyment of all.

She acknowledged the contribution of Limerick City & County Council in facilitating and
supporting the formation of the Trust from the outset. The formation of the Trust was also
consistent with one of the objectives of the current River Basin Management Plan for Ireland,
which is to develop bottom up, community-based approaches to managing water bodies and
improving water quality. The Trust endeavours to achieve its aims by creating awareness;
encouraging community participation; improving water quality, fish habitats and fish
numbers; protecting biodiversity; controlling invasive plant species; encouraging local angling
traditions; and developing amenity access to the river.

She confirmed that the Trust had been successful in accessing grant aid for specific river
related projects including funding from LEADER, Heritage Council, LA21, JP McManus
Benevolent Fund and the Community Water Fund. Unfortunately, however, she explained
that none of these grants mentioned cover the core running costs of the Trust such as
insurance, venue hire, company secretary services and each year the Directors struggled to
meet these costs. She confirmed, therefore, that any contribution that Limerick City & County
Council could make towards these running costs would be greatly appreciated by the Trust.

The Members thanked Ms Goggin for her presentation and acknowledged the work being
done by the Maigue River Trust in raising awareness of the issue of protecting rivers and lakes
amongst the public. They agreed that it was important that such resources were protected
and that they were vital for encouraging tourism and visitors to an area. They also noted the
importance that angling played in monitoring and protecting the quality of rivers and lakes.
They agreed to look at options for funding support to ensure that the ongoing work of the
Maigue River Trust would be supported into the future.

3e Service Operations Directorate
(i) Planning & Environment Services

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Seamus Martin, Assistant Engineer Planning & Environmental
Services to the Meeting. Mr Martin updated the Members on the current situation
regarding the Taking in Charge of eleven estates in the Municipal District. In a lot of cases,
he explained, the local authority were waiting on reports from Irish Water before it could
make a final decision in relation to taking in charge of estates, while issues in relation to
Bonds were a factor for some estates.

The Members thanked Mr Martin for his presentation but expressed disappointment at the
fact that it was taking so long to take some estates in charge, given that some had been
completed since 2004/2005. They were also critical of delays in receiving reports from Irish
Water, which was also affecting the taking in charge process. They welcomed changes made
in recent years in relation to the revised bond rate being sought for each property as part of
any planning permission being granted. Finally, they requested that a further update be
provided at the May 2019 Meeting on the taking in charge of these eleven estates in the
Municipal District.

Question
7. Question submitted by Councillor Brigid Teefy

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District for an update on the Road
Improvement Scheme for Beary’s Cross Junction on the N24. What is the timescale for this
project and when is the likely completion date?

REPLY: A new roundabout controlled junction is to be constructed at Beary’s Cross, which
will entail the construction of a new section of regional road R513 approach to the junction
and the alteration of the existing N24 approaches to the junction. Part Vill planning for the
scheme was approved in October 2017.

The scheme was subsequently advanced in 2018 in preparation for the compulsory purchase
statutory procedure. To this effect, ground investigation and additional topographic studies
were undertaken to ensure that the most recent site information is available. Consultations
with affected parties along the scheme, in addition to the preparation of the statutory
documentation, is currently underway.

It is expected that the Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) will be advertised in the coming
months. Subject to the confirmation of the CPO stage and approval of Transport
Infrastructure Ireland (TIl), the Mid West National Road Design Office will commence the
tender process for the construction of the scheme.

Notice of Motion

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Brigid Teefy

| will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District that maintenance work be carried
out on the Sli na Sldinte walking route from Holycross to Bruff.

Proposed by Cllr Teefy, seconded by Cllr Sheehy.

REPLY: The Kilmallock Roads Crew would have undertaken minor upkeep works on the Sli
Na Slainte walking route from Holycross to The Pike in Bruff during 2018 to address
overgrowth onto the walkway. Following on from it the matter was discussed with the
Kilmallock CE Scheme about including this work to their work schedule going forward. They
have agreed to undertake these works, which will entail three to four visits during growing
season, and this work will commence in the coming weeks.

The Elected Members noted this reply but suggested that this work could possibly be carried
out by the community Employment Scheme in Bruff and it was agreed that this option
would be investigated.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mike Donegan

| will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District that an audit is carried out on signage,
including tourist and leisure signs, in Kilmallock town and approach roads.

Proposed by Cllr Donegan, seconded by Cllr O’Donnell.

REPLY: A review of individual signage across the Municipal District is carried out following
requests from the Elected Members or the public.

The Cappamore-Kilmallock Roads Section is responsible only for road signage and not tourist
or leisure signs but we will clarify with Cllr Donegan as to what an audit would entail in relation
to signage and we can provide a further response at the March Municipal District Meeting.

The Members noted the response and highlighted the importance of an ongoing review of
signage provision across the District. This would ensure that signage was in place at all cross
roads and junctions and proper signage was also important for Tidy Towns purposes. They
also agreed that, given the cost of signage, that consideration should be given to the logging
of signage as an asset and the possible use of barcoding on signage for identification purposes.

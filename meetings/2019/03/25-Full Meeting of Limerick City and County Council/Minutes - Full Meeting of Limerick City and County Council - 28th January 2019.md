these amenities.---

and Broadford Castles, Barnagh Tunnel, the two Railway houses on the

greenway, Fullers Folly and walks at Knockfierna and Mularadharc.

 The need, in relation to the Great Southern Greenway to provide better

access for those with special needs, improved signage, toilet facilities and

surface and to address the fact that the trail passes through a working farm.

 The potential of the Old Railway Store in Rathkeale to be restored and

developed as a location where bicycles could be hired by those planning to

cycle the Great Southern Greenway

 The need to provide details of our tourism products online and in an

interactive format, availing of technologies such as phone apps, appropriate

amenity to be open to the public on Saturdays.

Council to consider extending their marketing services into the weekend.

 The need for confirmed investment in tourism to create local jobs and

promote local attractions such as Lough Gur and the stone circle.

 That Limerick has been let down by Fáilte Ireland with most of the funding

going elsewhere. That an increase in the Council’s Arts and Culture budget is

needed along with increased engagement with the Cultural Committee.

 A marina on the River Shannon should be developed in the City.

 The risk to the amenity of the River Shannon associated with the proposed

extraction by Irish Water should be addressed in the Plan.

 The need for a yearly review of the strategy.

 The need for proposals to reopen the Black Bridge on the Shannon to be

included in the strategy.

 The need to be mindful of the Shannon Way offering and to tie in with same.

tourist offering in the city centre with the development of cinemas, crafts,

fashion and cultural attractions.

 The need to develop Nicholas Street as an attraction, in conjunction with King

John’s Castle.---

city.

experience

 The need to include Knights Hospitallers Abbey, Hospital in the plan.

that many of the issues raised by Members were included in a more in-debt version of the

plan, which was also available. He pointed out that Brand Limerick and a Festivals and Events

Strategy were under development.

In relation to the Great Southern Greenway, the Director, Social Development noted that the

Council was looking at tendering the design of same and that signage and standards would

improve as the project progressed. Visitor numbers and commercial interest was increasing

and there would be engagement with the Members at the appropriate juncture. He stressed

that, while the Tourism Development Strategy covered a four year period it would be

reviewed annually at SPC level and it would be easy to measure progress.

With regard to the Munster Vales, the Director, Social Development noted that this was not

a Fáilte Ireland Brand but was funded by the associated four Local Authorities. He pointed out

that Castleconnell would be included on the Shannon River Masterplan. He noted that

suggestions to open the Museum at weekends would be taken on board but that resource

implications would have to be taken into consideration. With regard the Rugby Museum he

pointed out that this was not a Council Project and that same was progressing.

Notices of Motion

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan

I am calling on Limerick City and County Council to agree and confirm dates with the

National Transport Authority for the installation of the additional Docking Stations promised

in 2018 for Limerick City Coca Cola Bike Scheme and to also consider licencing an alternative

‘Dockless Bike Hire Scheme’ for Limerick City and Environs that would provide greater

flexibility and coverage to areas of Limerick City and Environs not currently covered with

Coca Cola Bike stations.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hogan (E) and seconded by Councillor Donegan (M);

In proposing the motion Councillor Hogan noted previous commitments in this regard from

the Council and highlighted the benefits of the Dublin Dockless System operated through a

phone App.

In seconding this motion Councillor Donnegan highlighted the need for the Crescent College

to be included in the existing bike scheme and suggested that the motion be forwarded to

the Travel and Transportation SPC for further discussion.

**REPLY:**

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is responsible for the Coca Cola Bike

Scheme in Limerick, and has contracted out the operation of this scheme to a

private company. The NTA has previously agreed to an extension to the Coca---
Cola Bike Scheme in Limerick, but this has not been able to proceed to date

due to issues the NTA has experienced in obtaining new equipment. This has

unfortunately resulted in delays to opening new stations and major

maintenance works at existing stations.

The NTA is resolving this equipment supply issue and has confirmed that its

first priority is to replace damaged equipment at existing stations and bring

these stations back to full operational capacity and then to follow on with

the installation and opening of the new stations.

The NTA has advised that it will endeavour to advance the works as quickly as

possible, however at this time, it is unable to confirm precise dates for the

works, but it has indicated that it plans to repair and bring current stations

back to full operational capacity during Q1 and Q2 of 2019, and that it could

be Q3 to Q4 of 2019 before the promised new stations are installed and

opened. The NTA will keep the Council updated during the year and will

endeavour to complete the works as quickly as possible.

In relation to a ‘Dockless Bike Hire Scheme’ for Limerick, a small number of

companies have expressed an interest in operating this type of scheme in

Limerick. Presently we are researching the viability of these schemes and

developing guidance and policy for their operation in Limerick based on

experience in other cities. When this work is completed and we identify the

appropriate scheme and guidance for Limerick we will formally seek

expressions of interest from interested companies to operate the scheme.

Before introducing any scheme in Limerick City, we will seek the approval of

the Metropolitan District Council for the preferred scheme.

In discussing the motion, Members highlighted the need to expand the current bike scheme

to UL and Patrickswell. With regard to Dockless Schemes, it was noted that a high level of

bicycle theft prevailed in relation to the scheme in Amsterdam, while in Paris many such

bicycles were found when the canals were cleaned.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

I will move at the next Full Council Meeting that this Council calls on the Department of

Housing to consider a grant aid scheme for Granny Flat extensions for persons on the

housing list where agreement is reached with the houses owner and the applicants.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Galvin (L) and seconded by Councillor Keary (S).

In proposing the motion Councillor Galvin pointed out that such a scheme would encourage

young couples to build next to rural houses, support small scale contractors, help maintain

pupil numbers in local schools and reduce housing waiting lists. He noted the potential for---
the Council to let out the property in the future and asked that the Housing Department

contact the Minister in relation to the motion and that the motion be circulated to all Local

Authorities.

In seconding the motion Councillor Keary noted that this proposal had previously been

raised at the Home and Social Development SPC and he expressed disappointment that no

reply had been received by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in

this regard. He pointed out that the proposal could be availed of by couples seeking to

downsize their accommodation by building an extension to their family home for their own

use with their children taking over the original family home.

**REPLY:**

The Housing Development Department note the proposal.

There is no scheme of this nature at present. However, it is open for private

owners to make a proposal to Limerick City and County Council to construct

an additional unit on their lands and sell or lease the additional unit to the

Local Authority. In this case the units would be allocated in accordance with

the scheme of letting priorities. Any proposal to add an additional

unit/granny flat within an existing plot would be subject to the normal

planning criteria.

Members supported the motion, noted high pre building costs and that the Improvement

Works In Lieu Scheme, previously in place, was relevant to the proposal. Members also

highlighted the need for new house builds and access to mortgage finance to resolve the

housing crisis.

The Director, Housing Development, noted that the Improvement Works in Lieu Scheme

was no longer active and that the number of houses being built was increasing through the

year with plans to exceed current targets.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh

I will move at the next meeting that this Council acknowledges resource issues in the

departments performing the inspection and enforcement processes and this lack of

resources is having an impact on Building Control, Fire Safety and Tenancy Enforcement. I

will request the Council to examine the feasibility of assigning additional resources to these

departments.

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh (M) and seconded by Councillor Costelloe

(J).

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh acknowledged work taking place but

expressed concern that the level of resources assigned to monitoring the construction of

new buildings in the Council’s administrative area was not sufficient to robustly monitor the---
level of construction taking place. Councillor McCreesh highlighted the risks that buildings

will not be constructed in accordance with planning permission and that development

levies due to the Council will not be identified as collectable. He stressed the need for

ongoing communication between the Planning and Building Control Departments.

Councillor McCreesh also noted the need for greater resources to be applied to Tenancy

Enforcement to deal with tenants breaking the conditions of their Tenancy Agreements and

to the inspection of privately owned property providing accommodation under HAP and

RAS.

**REPLY:**

Budget 2019 has included provision for the recruitment of three additional

staff members to join the Council’s tenancy enforcement team.

Limerick City and County Council Fire Authority and Building Control

Authority operates under the **Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003** and the

**Building Control Act 1990 to 2014**.

Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act places a duty on every person having

control over premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the

outbreak of fire on such premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.

Section 3 (5) of the Building Control Act requires buildings to be designated

and constructed in accordance with relevant requirements of the building

regulations and that building owners, designers and builders are bound by

this legal requirement.

Limerick City and County Council carried out 210 inspections under the Fire

Services Act and 82 inspections under the Building Control Act in 2018. This

gives a total of 292 inspections.

Limerick City and County Council implements a comprehensive programme of

inspections under both the Fire Services Act and the Building Control Act. The

majority of the inspections under the Fire Services Act were as a result of

complaints from the general public, pre event inspections and pre court

inspections for licensing. The follow up procedure depends on the issues

identified as a result of the inspections and may involve writing to the owner

or occupier setting out the fire safety deficiencies and any remedial works or

initiating enforcement action e.g. warning letters, fire safety notices etc.

In terms of inspections under the Building Control Act, the performance

standard for a risk based programme of building control inspections is set

nationally at 12-15% of new buildings notified to the Building Control

Authority. Limerick City and County Council as Building Control Authority has---
consistently achieved this target in recent years. Building Control inspections

may be as a result of complaints from the public or part of a programme of

building control inspections.

Limerick City and County Council as Fire Authority and Building Control

Authority is satisfied that the level of resources currently available for the

inspection and enforcement processes is reasonable and delivers a

comprehensive programme of inspections. As additional funds were not

sought for this work programme during the 2019 Budget process, it should be

noted that any reassignments of resources to this area from within the Fire

and Emergency Services Department would have a negative impact on other

areas of activity within the Department.

The Director, National and Regional Shared Services noted that 100% of HAP related

inspections were carried out. The Deputy Chief Executive pointed out that budgetary

constraints would have to be taken into consideration in relation to any additional resources

allocated.

Members noted that any project involving the construction of two or more houses had to be

certified by the associated Quantity Surveyor, Architect or Engineer as compliant with

Building Regulations.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

I will move at the next meeting that each individual Councillor considers sending solidarity

and support to our nurses and midwives who have balloted for strike action beginning

January 30th to demand a safe, fully staffed, functioning health service that values and pays

them as essential skilled workers.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Costelloe (J) and seconded by Councillor McCreesh

(M).

In proposing the motion Councillor Costelloe noted the extent of patients waiting on trolleys

and the stressful conditions nurses work under.

16. Correspondence

The Correspondence circulated with the Agenda was taken as read.

Councillor Galvin referred to the letter dated 18th December, 2018 from Kerry County

Council and the enclosed resolution relating to the undocumented in America and indicated

his support for the resolution.---

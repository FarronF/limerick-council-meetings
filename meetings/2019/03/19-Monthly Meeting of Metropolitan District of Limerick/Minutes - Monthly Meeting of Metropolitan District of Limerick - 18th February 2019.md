**Question submitted by Comhairleoir S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the Regeneration Project is still on track to be completed by the***

***envisaged date, and how many houses are to be built in each Regeneration area this year.***

**REPLY**:

The Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) was adopted

by the Elected Members of Limerick City and County Council on the 24th February

2014. The plan outlines a ten-year programme of works to 2023 under the

physical, social and economic pillars. The National Capital Plan published in 2018

confirms the target completion date of 2023 and funding of €170 million over the

period 2018-2023.

The LRFIP outlines a housing new build programme of five hundred and ninety

three homes. Following a review of the Demolition and Retention Strategy in 2015

/ 2016, forty-four houses were removed from the demolition zone, which reduced

the new build requirement to five hundred and forty nine. As at the 31st December

2018, two hundred and sixty five new build homes are completed (50% of the

programme). These include schemes such as :

Cliona Park Phase 1

34 Units

Cliona Park Phase 2

10 Units

Lord Edward Street

81 Units

Colivet Court, Southill

35 Units

Churchfield, O’Malley Park, Southill

42 Units

Wallers Well

10 Units---

A further two hundred and sixty one homes have received funding approval from

the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. It is anticipated that

a number of these projects will progress to construction state in 2019 including:

Cosgrave Park Phase 1, Moyross

30 Units

Churchfield Phase 2, Southill

38 Units

Palm Close, Southill

27 Units

45 – 46 Cliona Park, Moyross

2 Units

In addition to the new build programme refurbishment of voids and derelict homes

is ongoing and these are generating new homes. The Thermal Upgrade

Programme is also well progressed. This programme upgrades existing occupied

private and Local Authority homes.

It is anticipated that the regeneration programme will be completed in line with

the target completion date of 2023.

**Question submitted by Comhairleoir S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update from Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae Luimnigh on***

***the current situation and future plans for Rathbane Golf Club.***

**REPLY**:

The current situation with Rathbane Golf Course is that it remains under the

management of Mack Trading Company Ltd. and is operating in line with the agreed

contract. There is regular engagement under an agreed meeting structure

between the Golf Club, Mack Trading and the Council. This aims to address any

arising issues that the Club or other stakeholders may have and is proving beneficial

to date. As there is a contract in place there are no immediate future plans for the

golf course.

***discuss plans for flood defences in the District.***

A/Senior Executive Officer, Dara McGuigan confirmed that the Physical Development Directorate

for the various suicide prevention groups that work tirelessly patrolling the river. In seconding

operate from.

It was proposed by Councillor Collins to amend the motion to include Land Search and Rescue.

**REPLY**:

In response to the Notices of Motion submitted at the January meeting of District

by Councillors Hogan and Secas and arising from the increased number of requests

generally to provide facilities or property for community groups and organisations

throughout Limerick, I advised at the January meeting that the Council intended as

a first step to conduct an audit of existing community facilities. This work has now

commenced in partnership with the local development companies. This audit

will identify the existing provision of facilities across Limerick City & County and

inform a strategy that will seek to ascertain future needs. Limerick City & County

Council already supports a large number of organisations through the lease of

property but it not possible to accommodate all requests. The audit will also seek

to identify opportunities for groups to share facilities.

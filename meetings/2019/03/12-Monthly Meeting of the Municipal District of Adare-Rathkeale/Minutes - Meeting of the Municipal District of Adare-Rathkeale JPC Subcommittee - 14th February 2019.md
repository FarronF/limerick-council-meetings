**Policing Christmas 2018** **–** **Rathkeale**

At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Deasy to the Meeting.

Members proceeded to discuss the CCTV operation in Rathkeale. They felt the current

CCTV was not fit for purpose as accessing data appeared to be cumbersome and were of

the opinion that the viewing of data should be available in the District. While Members

welcomed the operation of CCTV in towns in the District they felt an app should also be

developed for Gardaí which would save time in the event of an active crime.

The Head of Digital Strategy informed Members for Gardaí to access live CCTV footage a

discussion would have to take place at a National level due to data protection and

legislation. Gardaí in the District are facilitated to view CCTV footage when required.

However, the downloading of CCTV footage for investigation purposes requires a strict

formal process which includes a request signed off by a member of An Garda Síochána no

less than a Superintendent. Identification of a Garda number is required before footage

can be downloaded to an encrypted device.

In response to queries from Members, Superintendent Deasy advised Members the

Gardaí are very happy with the access to and effectiveness of the CCTV in the District.

CCTV can be viewed quickly and easily for live investigations. With regard to the

monitoring of the system in individual Garda Stations, the Superintendent believes it is

more effective for the CCTV to be monitored in one place. He noted the Gardaí also get

great assistance from dash cams, private CCTV footage and also members of the public.

Discussion took place in relation to the policing plan for the Adare-Rathkeale District over

the Christmas period. Members complimented the Superintedent and his staff for the

excellent policing of the District over the season. While some residents of the town of
---
Rathkeale had complained of over policing due to checkpoints etc. it was agreed that the

District experienced a relatively crime free Christmas season as a result of this policing

plan. The Superintendent advised the biggest issue in the town of Rathkeale for the

festive period was littering and the sale of cheap alcohol.

Member felt there could never be enough policing with more resources required in the

future for rural areas along with the return of Gardaí on the beat in the areas, who are

familiar with people in the community. Disappointment was expressed with Tusla

however for not engaging with the youths of the District who have no parental control

exercised.

The Superintendent acknowledged Rathkeale as unique during the Christmas period due

to the increase of engagement parties and wedding parties. While they increased a Garda

presence to maintain a degree of control this did not affect other areas in the District.

There were various checkpoints in the town which resulted in six arrests for drink driving

and drug offences. There were also fifteen cars seized for offences including criminal

activity and theft. Prior to Christmas the Gardaí met with local schools and Foróige and a

youth café was open week days to cater for children from eight years plus. The uptake

for the youth café was significantly high with two sittings facilitated to cater for the

increased numbers. There was also great cooperation from licenced premises around the

town and only one serious incident was reported, which occurred on Christmas night.

There was also a number of domestic situations which Gardaí dealt with efficiently and a

number of searches under the Criminal Justice Act which were also very successful. Drugs

were also ceased in the town of Rathkeale as well as many other areas in the District. The

Superintendent complimented the multi-agency cooperation which worked well over the

Christmas period.

The Cathaoirleach requested if there could be an improvement on litter law enforcement

incorporated into the 2019 Christmas policing plan. He also wished Sergeant Flood well

in his promotion and enquired if the position of Sergeant in Rathkeale would be vacant

for long. The Superintendent advised Members there is a lot of interest in the position,

therefore, it would be filled in the near future.

Members thanked the Superintendent and Head of Digital Strategy for their attendance

and contribution to the Meeting.

This concluded the Meeting.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Kevin Cribbin and Professor Cathal O’Donnell to the

Meeting.

Professor O’Donnell gave a presentation to Members outlining the role of the Cardiac First

Responder (CFR) as well as the costs involved in the setting up of a CFR group. At present

there is a group of 10 – 12 responders in Adare who are on call 24/7. Although they are

connected to the National Ambulance Service, who cover insurance while on call and

provide limited training, it is the responsibility of the responder group to organise and

fund their own public liability insurance, training and equipment costs. The initial start-

up cost is in excess of €5,000 with the ongoing cost not as significant.

Following discussion, all Members were in agreement the CFR scheme a worthy local

successful prosecutions and paid tribute to members of the public, witnesses and injured

parties for without their assistance certain investigations would not have progressed. He also

noted the importance of cctv in tackling crime and referred to the newly installed cctv by

Limerick City and County Council.

He mentioned that specific controls were put in place across the district for Halloween along

with extra patrols of the area. He also made reference to burglaries including theft from

vehicles. He stated that people should be conscious when leaving their houses to ensure they

light up and lock up. He mentioned the need to identify neighbours requiring assistance

during the Christmas period and months of darkness.

He also stated that the Newcastle West Garda Station was going to be refurbished and this

necessitated the re-location of work colleagues to other stations while works are being

progressed.

The Cathaoirleach and Members complimented the Superintendent on the overview of the

current situation within the district. The Members referred to a number of items including

Community Policing and the importance of same, the availability of drugs within the district,

anti-social behaviour, the locations of Go Safe Vans, immigrants coming into the county, the

possibility of having retired gardai involved in policing and the mobility of Gardai. The

opening hours of Abbeyfeale Garda Station was also raised with some Members stating that

the Station could be utilised more and the opening hours extended.

The Members also wished Superintendent O’Neill well in his new appointment and

acknowledged his work within the District but concern was expressed on the turnover of

Superintendents assigned to the Newcastle West, as consistency is required in order to

progress long-term policing plans.

As the Monthly Municipal District Meeting was due to commence, it was agreed to continue

with the JPC Sub Committee Meeting and it was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded

by Councillor Collins to delay the start of the Monthly Meeting.

Superintendent Deasy referred to the training of Gardai with regard to the detection of drug

driving and Inspector Cullen also confirmed that there are two Gardai who are immigrant

officers with additional members awaiting training. Superintendent Deasy also confirmed

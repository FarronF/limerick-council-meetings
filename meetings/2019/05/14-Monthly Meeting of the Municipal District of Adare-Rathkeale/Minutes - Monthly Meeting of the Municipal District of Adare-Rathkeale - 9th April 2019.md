**Operations and Maintenance Services**

**Traffic Calming Scheme Ballingarry**

Members discussed the proposed Traffic Calming Scheme for Ballingarry and expressed

dismay that the original plan which provided for the installation of speed ramps was not

now going ahead and given that the original plan was already in the public domain that

there was an expectation in the local community that ramps would be installed in

Ballingarry. It was explained by the Executive that the new proposed Traffic Calming

Scheme would include footpath installations and upgrade a pedestrian crossing and driver

feedback signage.

Discussion ensued on the funding sources for the proposed Traffic Calming Scheme and it

was explained by the Senior Executive Engineer that €40,000 Development Funding

originally allocated to Ballysteen in 2018 was not now going ahead and this money would

now be used to fund the Ballingarry Traffic Calming Scheme with a further €44,000

allocated to Ballingarry under the Low Cost Safety Scheme 2019, bringing the total to be

spent on Traffic Calming in Ballingarry to €84,000.

Members were not in favour of the interim proposal of €30,000 from the Ballingarry Traffic

Calming Scheme monies be used to fund the €30,000 required to complete the Askeaton Slí

na Slainte scheme. Members were of the opinion that while there was merit on safety

grounds in completing both schemes, the €30,000 required for Askeaton should be

allocated from an alternative source of funding.

Following discussion it was agreed to adjourn the item in order to give all due consideration

to the Ballingarry Scheme. The Cathaoirleach called for a Special Meeting to be scheduled

for Friday 12th April at 4.00 p.m. to discuss the Traffic Calming Scheme in Ballingarry further.

It was agreed Item 3 on the Agenda would be taken next.

**QUESTIONS**

**17.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next Meeting, following form a previous motion which was passed**

**requesting traffic calming measures for Shanagolden, what is the current update or**

**status.**

**Reply:**

A traffic study has been carried out and this has shown that traffic

calming works are required. A preliminary design will now be carried out.

**18.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next Meeting that this Council provide funding for a design of a pedestrian**

**bridge to be located beside the Christopher Lynch bridge in Rathkeale with respect to**

**road safety for pedestrians.**

**Reply:**

I have spoken with Brian Kennedy, Director, Physical Development

Directorate, and there is no change to the previous reply. (Reply 8th January,

2019).

The installation of a pedestrian footbridge, adjacent to the existing

roadbridge (Christopher Lynch Bridge) can be considered, however, no

funding has been identified or provided for this in the current capital plan.

Consideration could be given by the Municipal Council of Adare-Rathkeale to

assigning a portion of the 2019 General Municipal Allocation budget for the

District to look at a feasibility study for this bridge. If the study concludes

that the provision of a bridge is feasible, then an application for funding could

be made under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, administered by the

Department of Rural and Community Development, or the Rural

Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), to provide the Bridge.

**19.**

**Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many working electrical charging points do we have in**

**our district for the charging of electric cars and what are their locations.**

provided on the ecar website and includes locations at Adare and Foynes.---

The operation and maintenance of these points is managed by Electric

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**20.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, in view of the**

**damage spiralling insurance costs are causing to community groups, voluntary**

**organisations, charities and small business, calls on the Government to accelerate its**

**insurance reform programme. In particular, Limerick City and County Council calls on the**

**Government to immediately establish a distinct Insurance Fraud Unit with An**

**Garda Síochána, establish an interim Judicial Council which will address excessive awards**

**made in our courts and insist on greater transparency in relation to claims and premiums**

**from Irish insurers.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Teskey stated that procedures need to be put in place

to give fair consideration for insuring young drivers as the immense cost of car insurance

means they are finding it difficult to insure their cars.

This Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

It was agreed the Motion would go to full Council for consideration.

**21.**

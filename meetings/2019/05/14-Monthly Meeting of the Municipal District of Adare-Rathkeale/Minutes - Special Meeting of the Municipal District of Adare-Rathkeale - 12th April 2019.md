**Traffic Calming Measures in Ballingarry**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed all to the Meeting.

The Senior Executive Engineer circulated a plan of the proposed traffic calming scheme for

Ballingarry to the Members and explained works would include footpath upgrade,

installation of a pedestrian crossing and driver feedback signage.

Members expressed disappointment that the original proposal, which included speed

ramps, was not now going ahead adding that the original plan was in the public domain and

there was an expectation that ramps were being installed by the local community of

Ballingarry.

Discussion ensued regarding the funding of the project. The Senior Executive Engineer

explained to Members that €40,000 of funding was coming from Development Fund monies

allocated to a road scheme in Ballysteen in 2018, that did not progress and a further

€44,000 had been allocated from the Low Cost Safety Scheme 2019 thus giving a total of

€84,000 for completion of the Ballingarry Traffic Calming Scheme.

The Senior Executive Engineer requested approval to use €30,000 of this funding to

commence works on the Slí na Slainte in Askeaton in the interim and informed Members
---
this €30,000 would be returned to the Ballingarry Traffic Calming Scheme when

Development Fund monies 2019 were allocated.

Following discussion among Members, it was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue to

proceed with the proposed Ballingarry Traffic Calming Scheme as presented by the Senior

Executive Engineer and to allow for the temporary transfer of monies to the Slí na Slainte

walkway in Askeaton. It was also agreed the Development Fund monies in the sum of

€30,000 would be transferred back to Ballingarry Traffic Calming Scheme when the 2019

Development Fund monies are allocated. The Senior Executive Engineer assured Members

the proposed Ballingarry Traffic Calming Scheme would receive full funding of €84,000, as

discussed. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Teskey.

This concluded the Meeting.

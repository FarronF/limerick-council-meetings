NOTICES OF MOTION

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin
---
6

***I will move at the next Meeting that this local authority call on the Department of Housing,***

***Planning and Local Government to fund the disposal of asbestos roofs where applicants***

***qualify for grants under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that the cost of disposing of asbestos roofs

is very expensive. He requested that Limerick City and County Council write to the

Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to provide an additional top up grant

for the disposal of asbestos roofs, where relevant, under the Housing Aid for Older People

Scheme.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

Under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme grants for the upgrade works

to roofs are available and asbestos roofs are not disqualified under the

scheme. All types of roof repairs for the main dwelling house are covered

however the maximum grant available under the scheme is €8,000 inclusive of

VAT. If costings for the applicant are more substantial than this, it should be

remembered that this grant scheme is to help towards the cost of works to the

home to make it more habitable and may not cover the full costs of the works.

In terms of the notice to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local

Government, a request to increase the grant for the disposal of asbestos could

be recommended, but the grant available may not be increased.

11.

that Limerick City and County Council engage with the Principal of Tournafulla National School

regarding traffic safety at the school.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY**:**

A meeting was held two weeks ago with the school with regard to the above.

The Senior Executive Engineer also stated that he is liaising with the school and Community

Council regarding the submission of an application under the Clár Scheme.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council request a safety audit***

***to be carried out by the TII on the N21 junction at Coolanoran, Newcastle West, known as***

***Sweeps Cross, to make it safer for road users.***
---

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins requested a safety audit to be carried out by the

TII at Sweeps Cross on the N21 where accidents and road deaths have taken place. He also

stated that public lighting is required at this location.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

Sweeps Cross was assessed a number of years ago and subsequently a system

of right turn lanes were introduced. Central services will review accident

records at the cross since these improvements were made and if accidents are

still an issue, the junction will be reviewed to determine what further measures

could be implemented.

It should be noted that there are a significant number of other junctions across

the national road network that Central Services have scheduled for assessment

also.

***users.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins stated that this is a built up area on a long wide

street and requested that Limerick City and County Council install speed ramps at this location

in the interest of safety.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

REPLY:

The Council has a new policy for Traffic Calming in Urban Areas. The above

mentioned request will be assessed with regard to the requirements of this

policy.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Councillors of the Municipal District of Newcastle***

***West call on the Executive of Limerick City and County Council to begin the process to apply***

***for funding for the provision of a 25 metre public swimming facility/pool to be located in***

***Newcastle West Town to serve the people of the Municipal District and its hinterland.***

Prior to discussion on this Notice of Motion, it was proposed by Councillor Collins and

seconded by Cllr. Scanlan, and agreed by all that the Notice of Motion be amended as follows

to include the six Elected Members of the District:

“We the Councillors of the Municipal District of Newcastle West call on the Chief Executive of

Limerick City and County Council to begin the process to apply for funding for the provision

of a 25 metre public swimming facility/pool to be located in Newcastle West Town to serve

the people of the Municipal District and its hinterland”.

REPLY:

I wish to advise that Limerick City & County Council will shortly be tendering

for suitably qualified consultants to prepare a Sports & Recreation Strategy for

the Council. This strategy will examine the need for new or enhanced

swimming pool facilities provided by the local authority in the administrative

area of Limerick City & County Council.

The reply was noted but the Members stated as per the amended Notice of Motion, they are

requesting the Chief Executive of Limerick City and County Council to commence the process

of applying for funding for the provision of a 25 metre public swimming pool for the people

of Newcastle West and its hinterland. A meeting with the Chief Executive on this matter was

also requested.

The following items were also raised.

An update on the traffic management plan for Collins Park, Abbeyfeale, was sought and the

Executive Engineer, Roads stated that costings and drawings are currently being prepared.

An update on the programme of works at Ward’s Cross on the N21, Devon Road Cross on the

N21 and the junction west of Wards Cross was also requested. The Senior Executive Engineer

stated this matter is being progressed in conjunction with the TII, Central Services and the

Mid-West Roads Design Office.

An update was sought on the Newcastle West Integrated Movement Plan and whether the

traffic flow in the Daar Bridge area would be taken into consideration as part of this plan. The

Senior Executive Engineer stated that Consultants, Messrs. Malachy Walsh and Partners have

been appointed and meetings are taking place to progress the plan. He stated that traffic

flow in the Daar Bridge area is a separate large scale project where major costs are involved

and it does not form part of the Integrated Movement Plan.

An update on the purchase of the property at 15 Assumpta Park, Newcastle West, was

requested and the Meetings Administrator agreed to revert with an update from Property

Services on this matter.

It was agreed to hold the May Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 1st May, 2019, at 10.00

a.m., at Áras William Smith OBrien.

This concluded the Meeting.

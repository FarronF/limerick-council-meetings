wonderful example of supported housing accommodation to assist the elderly in retirement

isolation in the process.

Notice of Motion

Te Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Ger Mitchell

| will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that the
present legislation recently enacted in relation to the Road Traffic Act, incorporating
vehicle drivers, should be revisited.

On the proposal of Clir Mitchell, seconded by Cllr Donegan, it was agreed to amend this
Motion to the following:

“Iwill move that this Council write to the Minister for Transport requesting that the present
legislation recently enacted in relation to the Road Traffic Act, incorporating vehicle drivers,
be revisited.”

In proposing this Motion, Cllr Mitchell explained that it was his opinion that the new
legislation recently enacted in relation to drink driving and learner drivers, was excessive. He
believed the legislation was not properly thought out and was unfair to the majority of
vehicle drivers, particularly those in rural Ireland where there was little or no public
transport or taxi’s available to the public

The Members agreed that legislation enacted to curb the actions of a minority who abuse
the law, should not affect the actions and daily lives of the majority. They agreed that this
new legislation will result in more rural isolation and anxiety being instilled in people. They
also agreed that learner drivers are being penalised because the system for testing is not fit
for purpose resulting in huge backlogs and needs an immediate overhaul. The backlogs and
delays also result in young drivers incurring huge costs in purchasing extortionate insurance
premiums. The Members agreed that these laws should be immediately revisited and that a
more pragmatic and common sense approach should be used to achieve a fairer system for
all drivers.

Other Matters Arising:

At the conclusion of the Meeting, and with the permission of the Leas Cathaoirleach, the
following items were raised:

¢ Wandering Horses

The Members discussed the situation with regard to wandering horses in Council Estates in
the District, which are a source of nuisance and danger to the residents of these Estates. In
many cases, the horses are not chipped which makes it impossible to identify the owners of
these animals. The Members agreed that this matter needs to be supported by a service
available at weekends to deal with the problem. They added that horses roaming in Public
Areas and Housing Estates were affecting the current good work being carried out by Tidy
Town Committees and Community Councils.

e Vote of Sympathy

The Members extended a Vote of Sympathy to the family and friends of Mary Carroll nee
Donegan, Aunt of Cllr Mike Donegan, following her recent passing.

e Thanks

Cilr O'Donnell welcomed the progress on derelict sites/buildings by the Council in the
Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District and commended Gordon Daly, Director of Services
and James Clune, A/Senior Executive Officer on progress on this matter to date and in
particular in relation to the Herbertstown Co-Op site.

The Members acknowledged the work done by Cllr O’Donnell on getting the Herbertstown
Co-Op site dealt with. The Members agreed that the Social Development Directorate of the
Council is making considerable progress in tackling dereliction.

¢ Speed Limit Reviews

The Members expressed their disappointment that the Speed Limit Review was not yet
complete and hoped it would be done before the end of May.

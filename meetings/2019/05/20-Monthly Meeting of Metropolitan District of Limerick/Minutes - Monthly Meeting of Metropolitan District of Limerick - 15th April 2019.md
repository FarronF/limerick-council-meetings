Extensive works have been undertaken in upgrading the public realm of

Patrickswell in recent years utilising a combination of Hinterland Scheme, Town and

Village Renewal Scheme, Development Contribution Scheme funding, and the

Council’s own revenue resources, totalling more than €738,000.

The total allocation received from the Town and Village Renewal Scheme was

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council consider the***

***pedestrianisation of Catherine Street from Glentworth Street to Thomas Street, thus creating a***

***viable vibrant core urban space leading to increased footfall.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin referred to the need for pedestrianisation of Catherine

Street on a phased basis. The pedestrianisation of the streets will create a flow to the city centre

and allow for the hosting of street festivals. This motion was seconded by Councillor Secas.

**REPLY**: In 2001, Limerick City Council recognised that investment in urban re- development, under

a number of urban re-development schemes, needed to be supported by an improved

public realm and transport system. Following a design competition, the Limerick City

Centre Remodelling of Streets and Public Spaces programme was adopted by Council in

2002. This programme proposed a programme of public realm improvements across the

entire city centre. This strategy still forms the strategic basis for all public realm projects in

the city. Projects carried out to date include:

 Baker Place 2002 - creation of a new public square close to the railway station.

 Bedford Row 2006 - pedestrian priority environment adjacent to substantial urban

renewal projects.

 William Street and Sarsfield St - Public realm improvements targeted at facilitating

public transport and pedestrian priority through the primary retail area. Cost - €3.4

million

 St. John’s Square - Remodelling of a public square that restricted car movements and

provided a multi-functional amenity for residents.

 City Quays - The remodelling of the city's waterfront to create a world class amenity

along the River Shannon. The project included the construction of extensive

boardwalk, event spaces and parks that complement a number of private sector mixed-

use investments in the area.

In 2008, extensive public realm improvements providing a pedestrian focus were carried

out on Thomas Street and Catherine Street, at a cost of €4.3 million, which has seen the

development of a cafe quarter within the prime city centre retail area.

The Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan adopted in 2014, endorsed the Limerick City

Centre Remodelling of Streets and Public Spaces programme and proposed that the entire

public realm of the city be refurbished, with an initial focus on O'Connell Street, Henry

Street and Catherine Street. This became the Great Streets Programme.

Limerick City and County Council working with The National Transport Authority has

commenced the Transport Strategy for the Metropolitan Area of Limerick-Shannon. The

Transport Strategy will address all modes of transport (including pedestrian movement)

and will delineate the functions of the various streets, which in turn will inform the

ultimate finished design for particular streets.

It is also important to note that the design of these streets is interdependent on one

another, from identifying desire lines for pedestrians and cyclists through to linkages to

sites of interest in the city. Therefore, the continuity in design concept that will emerge is

important to the successful implementation of the Great Streets Programme.

An application under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund in 2018 to progress the

Great Streets programme was unsuccessful, however the application itself received very

positive feedback from the adjudication panel. The panel was cognisant of the Transport

Strategy and advised that it should inform the next phases of the Great Streets

Programme.

The Council will continue to explore all funding opportunities (including the URDF) to

support the Great Streets Programme, which will include proposals for the upgrading of

Catherine Street.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor K. O’Hanlon**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council prepare a report to enhance the area at***

***Cathedral Place at the statue of Patrick Sarsfield. Additional lighting, history displays, flower***

***arrangements and general cleaning should be considered.***

Members discussed this Notice of Motion and referred to the Notice of Motion submitted by

Councillor Gilligan at the March Meeting of the Metropolitan District. The Director, Service

Operations confirmed that the Motion was valid and if adopted would be issued to the relevant

department.

The motion was then proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon and seconded by Councillor O’Dea.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor K. O’Hanlon (to be referred to the**

**Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council consider installing a network of drinking***

***fountains in appropriate locations to cut the number of plastic bottles used.***

It was agreed that this Notice of Motion be referred to the Environment Strategic Policy

Committee.

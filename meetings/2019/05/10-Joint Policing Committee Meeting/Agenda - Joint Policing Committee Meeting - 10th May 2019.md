Séighin 6 Ceallaigh :

“| will ask at the next Meeting, what measures are being put in place to ensure there is more

proactive deterring policing model is in place to tackle the rising issue of anti social
behaviour’.

“On any given Friday and Saturday evenings how many community gardai, and or Garda
patrols, are available to police the current upsurge in public drinking / public order offences
in greater Castletroy / Newtown / Annacotty areas”.

To consider the following Question submitted by Councillor Jerry O'Dea :

“In the absence of governmental commitment to provide a Garda station in the rapidly
growing University of Limerick / Castletroy area, will the Commissioner of An Gardai commit
to provide a substation to service same ?”.

To consider the following Question submitted by Niall Collins, T.D.:

“twill ask at the next meeting of Limerick’s JPC for a report on the prevalence and use, illegal
or otherwise, of quads, scramblers, all terrain bikes and similarly types, across Limerick city
and county, the measures being taken to curb their anti social use, in particular by minors,
the numbers of same seized, impounded and/or subsequently destroyed, the number of
prosecutions taken arising from incidents involving same, whether additional legislation is
required and any other relevant information which can be provided”.

Substation in the area “.

the appointment of a new permanent Garda Sergeant to the Castleconnell Garda Station
providing cover to Annacotty, Castletroy and Castleconnell areas, | move that Limerick City

12. To consider the following Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller :

“I propose, since the existing road traffic legislation does not apply to green spaces, housing
estates, public parks or car parks and footpaths, that tough robust laws to cover quad bike
and scrambler use be introduced to cover the illegal use in the above commonly used
areas”.

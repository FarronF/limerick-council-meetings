**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**3.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council bring***

***forward draft design plans for the development of the Mungret site so that***

***suitable zoning can be approved by Councillors to facilitate the provision of a***

***Neighbourhood Park and new Primary/Secondary schools.***

Councillor Leddin in proposing the Motion stated that a public consultation meeting had

been held the previous Tuesday evening at which there had been 5 members present

from the Planning Department. He proposed that the Planning Department hold a 2nd

consultation evening towards the end of August and this proposal was seconded by

Councillor Collins and generally supported by Members. The Deputy Chief Executive

agreed to request the Planning Department to convene a further public consultation

meeting. He also stated that a report from Planning would be requested for

presentation at the September Meeting.

Councillor Byrne in seconding the Motion said that people needed to be encouraged to

make submissions and that it was important that the proposals included a Community

Centre and a playground which would be inclusive of people with disabilities.

In response to a question the Meetings Administrator stated that an SPC Scheme had

to be prepared and that it would be brought to the September Meeting of the Council.

He anticipated that it would be December before the Committees would be in place.

**4.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council establish an***

***emergency fund to enable basic essential maintenance work to be done on those***

***housing estates currently not taken in charge by the Council.***

The Meetings Administrator had pointed out that Motion Nos. 4 & 6 were matters for the

full Council since they referred to matters in the entire County.

Councillor Leddin stated that he had no problem with the Motion going to the full Council

but that there was a lot of estates where the developers were gone out of business and

that the setting up of an emergency fund was necessary.

Members requested that an audit of housing estates not taken in charge be carried out.

It was stated that people were paying lots of charges including property tax and that

they deserved to have all necessary services in estates.

**5.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors M. Quinlivan, S. Ó Ceallaigh and**

**M.McCreesh**

***We will move at the next Meeting that we agree to hold council meetings in***

***community centres across the City on a regular basis. At least once a year the***

***Metropolitan District of Limerick will hold a meeting in community centres in***

***areas such as Southill, Caherdavin, Castleconnell or Moyross. As a newly***

***constituted local authority, we should demonstrate the importance of the***

***community voice and of an open and transparent decision making process.***

Councillor Quinlivan in proposing the Motion stated that at least once a year a

Metropolitan District meeting should be held in a community centre. This he said would

create more interaction with the public since there was a perception out there that the

Council did not engage with the public.

Councillor Ó Ceallaigh seconded the Motion.

The Meetings Administrator pointed out that it would be required under Standing Orders

that the time, date and location of meetings be set down but that the Members could

decide to hold a particular meeting at an alternative location.

Members generally agreed with the spirit of the Motion.

**6.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council supports***

***the introduction of bye-laws or other measures which would ensure that circuses***

***which use animals are prohibited from performing in any part of the local***

***authority area in light of the well documented evidence of suffering endured by***

***the animals involved and the serious animal welfare issues raised.***

Councillor Butler proposed that the Motion be deferred to the next full Council Meeting.

Councillor O’Hanlon proposed that there be a representative from both sides of the

argument at the next Council Meeting.

This proposal was seconded by Councillor Prendiville

It was also stated that Members should have a decision making role regarding all

events taking place and that there should be Council policy on events including funding.

The Deputy Chief Executive stated that there were strict guidelines relating to event

management given to groups holding events and that a copy of these guidelines would

be issued to Members.

Members queried whether the proposed Notice of Motion referred to all lands or just to

those in Council ownership.
---
Councillor Butler requested that the Motion go to the full Council in his name and that it

be amended to refer to Council owned lands only.

This concluded the Meeting.

I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick call on

Irish Water to :

have been advised not to consume their tap water due to unacceptably

high levels of lead, be removed at no cost to the occupants, where it is

in private property or in the houses themselves;

 provide safe, drinkable bottled water, which does not need to be boiled

before it is used, to those affected. This should be available at

convenient locations such as shops and community centres. If Irish

Water refuse to provide this, the Council must step in and do so;

 ensure there is a regular supply of this bottled water to those such as

the elderly, who, for whatever reason, are unable to collect it

themselves. All costs incurred in the delivery of this water should be

covered by Irish Water. Again, if Irish Water refuse, the Council should

ensure this itself;

providing to the residents of these areas;

To each member of Municipal District of Newcastle West

Proposed Temporary Closure of Road L-1316-312
Article 12 Road Regulations 1994

Dear Councillor
I refer to the above.

In accordance with the requirements of Article 12 of the Road Regulations 1994 the Mid West
National Road Design Office intends to advertise its notice of intention to temporarily close road L-
1316-312 located in the townland of Ballintubbrid, Co Limerick for a distance of 30 metres with
effect from 10 a.m. on Monday 5” January 2015 to 7 p.m. on Friday 25 September 2015. This
temporary road closure is proposed in order to facilitate the construction of Phase II of the Killamey
Pole to Barnagh Road Safety Scheme which is intended to go to site later this year. It is proposed
that the N21 will serve as an alternative route for the duration of the road closure.

l enclose for your information a copy of drawing 02/068/0403/0015 Rev O showing the location of
the proposed temporary road closure. It is necessary for this office to progress this matter at this
juncture in order to ensure that this issue may be included in contract documentation to be signed at
a future date with the successful tenderer for this project. This is subject to the approval of the
Director of Service to the temporary closure of the road in question having considered any
submissions received on same.

It should be noted that it is not envisaged that road L-1316-312 wil] be closed for the full 9 month
duration sought in the above proposal. It is the understanding of this office that the successful
tenderer will rather seek to close the road in question for short intervals during the window sought
above.

An advert informing the public of the proposed temporary road closure is due to appear in the
forthcoming Limerick Leader Edition of Saturday 9" August 2014. The public will have an
opportunity in accordance with Article 12 of the Road Regulations 1994 to make a submission to
this office on this matter up until 4 p.m. on Friday 22 August 2014. It is the intention of this
office to place the above item on the agenda of the next meeting of the Municipal District of
Newcastle West taking place on 3" September 2014.

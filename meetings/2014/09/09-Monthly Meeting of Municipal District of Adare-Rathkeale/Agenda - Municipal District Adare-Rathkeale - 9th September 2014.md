LIMERICK CITY & COUNTY COUNCIL

September Meeting of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale to be held on
Tuesday, 9"" September, 2014.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

Has the Council addressed the concerns over the frequency of the transportation of
leachate from Gortnadroma dump into the An Curran Estate, Pallaskenry.

Reply:

Leachate from Gortadroma Landfill was being transported to Pallaskenry Waste
Water Treatment Plant at the rate of two lorry loads per day (approximately 30 cubic
metres per load) for treatment.

The landfill site has now closed for commercial operations. Therefore, the regular
use of the treatment plant will no longer be required. It may be required on an
occasional use basis but this should be on an infrequent or emergency basis.

LIMERICK CITY & COUNTY COUNCIL

September Meeting of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale to be held
on Tuesda h 2014.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

Has the Council addressed with Irish Water, the significant problem of flooding on
Plunkett Road, Askeaton caused by a combination of the storm and foul mains. Will
either the Council or Irish Water undertake to address this problem by separating foul
and storm water?

Reply:

The difficulty in this case is caused by the fact the storm and foul mains are
combined at this location, as they are throughout a large section of Askeaton. The
foul sewer needs to be separated from the storm drains to alleviate this problem.

It must be noted that the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provided for the transfer of
water services functions from the county and city councils to Irish Water with effect
from 1" January, 2014.

Section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides the mechanism for the
transfer of the assets, which will be achieved by the designation of a vesting day or
days by Ministerial Order.

The Department is preparing draft Ministerial Orders in this regard and the objective
is that the first of these Orders will be submitted to the Minister for the Environment,
Community and Local Government later this year.

The first Ministerial Order will transfer to Irish Water all pipes, sewers (with the
exception of storm water sewers) and related accessories that are currently in the
ownership of the councils or that are being used by the councils in the provision of
water services.

Any rights and liabilities (including contractual commitments) relating to those assets
will also transfer to Irish Water (this is provided for in section 13 of the Water
Services (No. 2) Act 2013.)

Limerick City & County Council is currently preparing an Assets Needs Brief for
submission to Irish Water in relation to the issue at Askeaton.

It will, on receipt of the submission from the Council, be a matter for Irish Water to
consider, prioritise and provide the funding necessary to undertake the necessary
works in accordance with their investment programme and strategic planning.

IMERICK CITY & NTY COUN

September Meeting of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale to be held on
Tuesday, 9"° September, 2014.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

Can the Council install road markings and proper signage at Kildimo National
School.

Reply:

| had a discussion with Roger McLoughlin of the school Board of Management on 3°
September, 2014 in which we discussed the following matters:-

(1) Yellow Lines

The school has drawn up a traffic management plan to control traffic movements in
the vicinity of the school gates. This plan involves the provision of single and double
yellow iines over a distance of around 250 metres. | informed Mr. McLoughlin that
the Council would be happy to assist with this work but that there was a statutory

. procedure to be followed before the lines could be put down. This procedure
required us to consult with the Gardai in advance. | will initiate this procedure

immediately.

(2) Signage

There was a faulty flashing warning sign on the approach from the village side which
was repaired on Tuesday.

(3) Traffic turning movements:

This is obviously a big problem here as it is at most schools due to the problems
caused by parents doing U-turns close to the school gates. It would be helpful to
have an off-road turning area but unfortunately the school does not have any spare
land that could be used for this purpose. There is a small piece of property available
opposite the school that might be suitable but funding is an issue in this regard. As
far as I'm aware there is no precedent in County Limerick for contributing financially
in these types of situations.

It is intended to meet on site in the near future to discuss the matter further.

Finbarr Keyes,
Senior Executive Engineer.

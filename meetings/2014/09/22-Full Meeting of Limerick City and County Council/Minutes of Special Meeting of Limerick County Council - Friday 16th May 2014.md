of Limerick County Council to: (a) call on Minister Phil Hogan, Minister
for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to retain our
LEADER Companies, Ballyhoura Development and West Limerick
Resources, as they currently exist; and (b) call on all Fine Gael and
Labour Councillors to give a commitment to the public, if they are re-
elected after May 23rd, to support the Fianna Fail Councillors to do all

At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed the large attendance of the public to the
Meeting and said the role of the public was primarily to observe and listen to the
proceedings of the Meeting.

Councillor Collins (M) expressed his disappointment that the Manager was not
present at the Meeting. In response, the County Secretary stated that the Manager
had a prior engagement which had been arranged before the date of the Special
Meeting had been set. Councillor Collins (M) proposed a short adjournment in order
to discuss if the Meeting should proceed in the absence of the Manager or whether
the Meeting should stand adjourned to another date when the Manager would be
available. This was seconded by Councillor Galvin and agreed.

On resumption, it was agreed to proceed with the business of the Meeting.

Councillor Collins (M), in proposing the Motion outlined above, read the following into
the Minutes:

“At the end of 2012, Minister Phil Hogan and the Government published a policy
document entitled “Putting People First’ which outlined proposals to align Local
Development Companies like West Limerick Resources and Ballyhoura with the Local
Authority. In January of this year, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 passed,
putting in place legislation enabling the planned changes. (i) The next Local & Community
Development Programme will now be subject to public procurement. West Limerick
Resources may still be able to tender for its delivery. However, so too will private for
profit companies. (ii) The newly established Local & Community Development
Committees (LCDCs) will be the applicant for the next Rural Development (LEADER)
Programme and not West Limerick Resources as under previous programmes.

West Limerick Resources, as well as Ballyhoura, have been highly successful in
implementing the various programmes over the years. They have built vast experience in
successfully drawing down funds, including Government funding outside of the core
programme. As a former Board member, | know the good that West Limerick Resources
has given communities and individuals alike in the promotion of Rural Development.
Every Councillor here today has seen the benefits in the communities they represent and
were not slow in claiming credit for these projects either.

The role of West Limerick Resources and Ballyhoura is to support, empower and work
with community groups to develop their ideas so that together they can exploit the
potential of our vibrant and growing communities. Everyone in the community should
have a voice irrespective of cultural, economic or social difference and this is what West
Limerick Resources and Ballyhoura deliver to community growth.

LCDP: Under the Local and Community Development Programme, community
development officers work on the ground with local community and voluntary groups to
investigate their needs and address disadvantage and social exclusion in their
community. They support the development of inclusive local representative structures
and establish new community based projects and initiatives. It is important to point out

here that these people give a service above and beyond their duty, often meeting groups
outside of office hours and late into the evening.

RDP: The Rural Development Programme provides support and funding for capital
investment in community facilities, services, heritage and enhancement programmes as
well as technical assistance in the form of plans, feasibility studies etc. Development staff
are available to offer advice and help to facilitate training where appropriate.

RSS: The Rural Social Scheme provides income support to farmers by harnessing their
skills and talents on part-time flexible employment opportunities on local community
projects, such as village and countryside maintenance and enhancement work, care for
the elderly, and on projects relating to not-for-profit organisations and cultural and
heritage sites.

Volunteer Support Service: Through this dedicated service, West Limerick Resources
provides ongoing support to community and other voluntary organisations in the
recruitment, management and retention of volunteers.

As well as losing the vast knowledge and experience these Companies have, we will also
have job losses in our area. Up to 33 core staff, with an additional 156 on RSS and Tus if
West Limerick Resources goes; 33 job losses in a time when unemployment is running at
14%. This will be a serious blow to my town of Newcastle West where the majority of the
jobs are.

Councillors, are you happy to guillotine this and do away with these jobs, jobs of friends,
neighbours and comrades that you and | have called on over the years to meet a
community group or individual to seek advice for them.

If these Companies are not retained, we, on behalf of our rural communities, are doing
them a grave injustice.

Rural Communities have already been decimated with Garda station closures, local co-
ops, shops, rural pubs in decline and possible post office closures too.

At January's Meeting, the establishment of the Local Community Development
Committee was guillotined through. It was done with no clear understanding on what the
LCDC’s role or function was. Clare County Council, North Tipperary and our soon to be
colleagues from Limerick City Council opposed the setting up of these LCDCs. They
were unanimously opposed by all parties pending National Agreement with our Rural
Development Companies. To date, no agreement has been reached.

| have learned to my dismay that you have called the first meeting of the LCDC for May
20" next. You have called it 3 days before an election. As the leader of the Fianna Fail
Group on Limerick County Council, | was not informed. | want to know why | was not
informed. | want to know who was informed, what is the purpose of the meeting, who has
been invited and what is the agenda. How can an LCDC meeting be convened when the
role of the LCDC has not been defined or do you know something that we do not know.

| am calling on my colleagues here today to wake up and see that these proposals will
further erode our rural communities and it is time to stand up and fight back.

| move the Motion.”

Councillor Collins (M) confirmed that he was proposing both part (a) and part (b) of
the Motion, as set out in the Requisition.

Councillor Collins (J) said he was formally seconding both parts of the Motion.

Councillor Galvin read to the Meeting an extract from the adopted Minutes of the
Council Meeting held on 27" January, 2014, in relation to the establishment of the
Local Community Development Committee, as follows:

“That, Limerick County Council hereby approves the establishment of the Limerick
Local Community Development Committee, in accordance with the Guidelines issued
by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.”

Councillor Galvin stated that the establishment of the LCDC had been unanimously
passed at the January Meeting.

Councillor Galvin put forward the following counter-proposal:

“That, we, the Fine Gael Group, retain the procedures presently in place
for the delivery of services through the Local Action Groups as
legislated for under EU Regulations.”

Councillor Scanlan, in seconding the counter-proposal, stressed the local
authority's support for rural Ireland and, while acknowledging the great work done by
the LEADER Companies, he stated that the establishment of the LCDC would
change their future role in relation to local and community development.

The Director of Corporate Services and Change Management, in the interest
of accuracy, stated that Limerick City Council had also passed a resolution to
establish the LCDC at its meeting on 27" January, 2014.

In response to queries regarding the role of the LCDC, the Director informed
the Members that Section 36 of the Local Government Reform Act, 2014, was quite
clear in relation to the role of the Committee, which he said was to develop, co-
ordinate and implement a coherent and integrated approach to local and community
development. He went on to state that Members would have wider functions at
district level to ensure that the needs of their communities were being fully
represented and met. Local Councils, it was noted, would be given a greater role in
local enterprise and economic development and in local and community
development activities. He added that the reforms would provide for the alignment of

*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
the local community development sector with local government through the
establishment of Local Community Development Committees, which would be
mandated to prepare Local Community Plans in order to bring strategic co-ordination
to the millions of euro spent each year on local and community development

initiatives.

It was brought to the Cathaoirleach’s attention that a person in the public
gallery was recording the proceedings of the Meeting. The Cathaoirleach stated
that, in accordance with the Council's Standing Orders, Rule No. 89, recording was
not permitted and he therefore requested that the recording would cease.

Following a lengthy debate where some Members supported the original
Motion and others supported the counter-proposal, the Cathaoirleach proposed a
further short adjournment in order to agree a wording for the Motion. It was agreed
that the Cathaoirleach and Party Leaders would meet in private to try and agree the
wording. At the request of some of the Members, it was agreed that a representative
from West Limerick Resources and Ballyhoura would also attend this meeting.

On resumption, it was noted that agreement had not been reached on the
wording of a single Motion for submission to Government.

Councillor Collins (M) then proposed the original Motion as follows:

“|, Clir. Michael Collins and my Fianna Fail Council colleagues, call on
Cathaoirleach, Clir. John Sheahan, to convene a Special Meeting of
Limerick County Council to (a) call on Minister Phil Hogan, Minister for
the Environment, Community and Local Government, to retain our
LEADER Companies, Ballyhoura Development and West Limerick
Resources, as they currently exist; and (b) call on all Fine Gael and
Labour Councillors to give a commitment to the public, if they are re-
elected after May 23, to support the Fianna Fail Councillors to do all
within their power to have the decision taken at January's Meeting to
establish the Local Community Development Committee, reversed.”

This was seconded by Councillor Foley.

The County Secretary indicated that a Vote would be taken on the Motion as
proposed by Councillor Collins (M) and seconded by Councillor Foley. The result of
the voting was as follows:

Galvin, and seconded by Councillor Scanlan, was withdrawn.

Environment, Community and Local Government to allow Local
Development Companies such as West Limerick Resources and
Ballyhoura Development Limited remain (LAGs) and be allowed to
tender directly for LEADER and other EU and National Funds under the
oversight of an agreed Local Community Development Committee
(LCDC).”

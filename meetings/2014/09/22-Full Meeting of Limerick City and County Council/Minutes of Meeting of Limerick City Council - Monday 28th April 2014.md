14. |. MANAGER'S REPORT AND ADOPTION OF THE JOINT TRAVELLER
ACCOMMODATION PROGRAMME 2014 — 2018

The Manager pointed out that this item was listed on the Agenda for the Monthly Meeting of the
City Council held on 24" March, 2014 at which it was agreed to defer making a decision on same
until a report on amendments had been prepared and a Special Meeting held to discuss same. A
Special Meeting was held on 1” April, 2014 to consider the Manager's Report and the adoption of
the Programme at which it was agreed that the Manager would revert back for the April Meeting
with an alternative wording for the Programme in respect of the Rhebogue Group Housing.

The Manager stated that the alternative wording which he is proposing incorporates the Council's
statutory responsibilities and the Councillors wishes and as a result of this amendment to the
wording he was recommending the adoption of the Joint Traveller Accommodation Programme
2014 — 2018. The recommended change to the wording be amended to read as follows :

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
Rhebogue Group Housing

“This development consists of five houses which accommodates one extended family grouping. A
previous proposal to accommodate the families at different locations was not achieved during the
period of the last programme. The current situation has been reviewed as part of the preparation
process for this programme. Four families resident on the site have expressed a preference for
individual houses to be purchased for them.

Having considered all the factors involved and the feasibility of delivering improved
accommodation for the families it remains the intention of the Council to comply with its statutory
responsibilities and to respond to the accommodation needs as assessed, and where possible, the
accommodation preferences of the residents of Rhebogue Group Housing Scheme.

However, it remains the intent of the Elected Members to oversee the closure of Rhebogue Group
Housing Scheme”.

Cllr. O'Hanlon thanked the Manager for his update and amended wording. Rhebogue Group
Housing has been an ongoing issue for many years. When the site was first developed four mobile
homes were provided and after a number of years these had to be replaced. Houses were then built
and again these had to be replaced. More houses were then built and some of these had to be
demolished. He said he would be totally opposed to erecting any more houses on this site. He said
conditions of families and children living on the site are totally unacceptable and while the site
remains open, these facilities should be made fit for living for the legitimate tenants there. He
pointed out that it is his understanding that a number of those on the site would be happy to move to
more suitable locations where they would have more freedom to practice their traditional way of
life. Last year there was a special meeting of this Council to discuss serious incidents in the
Rhebogue area and assurances were given by the City and County Manager and the Chief
Superintendent that measures would be put in place to prevent such incidents. Unfortunately, the
situation has seriously deteriorated since and the local G.A.A. Club, St. Patricks, are finding it
increasingly difficult to continue operating. He said he believed that Rhebogue Group Housing has
failed and it should be the policy of the Council to eventually close this facility and in the
meantime, make sure that conditions for those living there are maintained to an acceptable standard.
He called on the Manager to appoint a senior official to monitor the operation of the site. Urgent
dialogue is needed with the travellers on the site, the Irish Traveller Movement, the local
community, St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club, Gardai, Council Officials and the newly elected councillors
for the area. He said he was happy to propose the Programme subject to the amended wording in
relation to the Rhebogue Group Housing.

Cllr. Gilligan seconded Cllr. O'Hanlon's proposal. He too said this group housing has been an
ongoing issue for a long time. He said nobody has a right to behave in the manner in which some of
the people living in this group housing have behaved especially in relation to St. Patrick's G.A.A.
Club who do excellent work with young people. He called on the Chief Superintendent and City
and County Manager to carry out their promises and said he will be looking for specific action to be
taken.

Cllr. Long supported the previous speakers and also the community and St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club in
relation to Rhebogue Group Housing.

Cllr. McCarthy agreed with the previous speakers and also with Cllr. O'Hanlon's suggestion that a
senior official be appointed to deal with this group housing.

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
Cllr. Kennedy fully supported the previous speakers adding that very genuine complaints were
made by residents and St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club. He said promises were made in the past which
were not adhered to and the Council should not delay in finding a satisfactory solution to the

problem.

Cllr. Scully thanked the Manager for his contribution and amended wording in relation to this
matter and he welcomed and supported the previous speakers comments. He pointed out that the
closure of the Rhebogue Group Housing is not going to happen in the short term and will take time
to finalise. He fully supported the appointment of a Senior Official to monitor the operation of the
site. Also access to St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club needs to be looked at and an alternative access
provided. Every action must be taken to protect the Club.

Cllr. G. McLoughlin pointed out that he Chaired the Traveller Accommodation Programme
Committee for a number of years adding that he attended all meetings. He also stated that he visits
Rhebogue Group Housing site on a regular basis. He stated that the residents of the site all want to
leave the site and want to move to a site where they can practice their traditional way of life and
suggested that the Council look at suitable green sites in the city and county where they could move
to. He said that, in order to progress this matter, there needs to be a particular plan in place before
September. The Elected Representatives for the area and Council Officials should meet with the
travellers resident in the site to identify another suitable location.

Cllr. Hourigan stated that there should be short and long term plans for Rhebogue Group Housing
site. The present situation is not fair to the residents in the area, St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club and the
travellers themselves. Another temporary access should be provided immediately for St. Patrick's
and the site managed in a more satisfactory manner until such time as an alternative site is

identified.

Cllr. Shortt agreed with the previous speakers adding that there was a crisis with this site last
summer which resulted in The Gardai having to be present when St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club hosted
an event. This is not acceptable for a Club who do such tremendous work with young people. He
said al] halting sites in the city need to be reviewed and referred specifically to the Dock Road Site
which is in a very bad condition. He expressed hope that the amalgamation of city and county will
alleviate and help the situation. The Council should be proactive in building communities and
resolving problems that are experienced with these sites. He said security fencing should be erected
between St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club and Rhebogue Group Housing site in the short term.

Cllr. Hurley supported the previous speakers.

Cllr. Quinlivan welcomed the people in the public gallery from St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club and
thanked the Manager for his presentation. He stated that he had been a member of the Traveller
Accommodation Programme Committee for five years and said all councillors, residents and
travellers themselves want to see the closure of Rhebogue Group Housing site. This issue needs to
be resolved now and a timescale set for the closure of the site. A commitment is needed also from
the Gardai that people in the area will be allowed live in their homes safely and without

intimidation.

The Manager thanked Members for their comments and said he was particularly aware of how
serious this issue is but added that it is a very complex one. He assured Members that a solution
will be provided but it will not be immediate. The issues raised by Members will be addressed and
a proposal for an alternative entrance for St. Patrick's G.A.A. Club examined. He said that a
sustainable solution has to be found and said he would abide by the intentions of this Council.

Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin thanked the Members for their comments and also the
people in the public gallery who came to the meeting and said she was confident that the Manager
would find a satisfactory solution to this problem.

Therefore, it was proposed by Cllr. O'Hanlon, seconded by Cllr. Gilligan and unanimously agreed to
adopt the Joint Traveller Accommodation Programme 2014 — 2018 subject to inclusion of the
following amendment in the Programme :

Rhebogue Group Housing

“This development consists of five houses which accommodates one extended family grouping. A
previous proposal to accommodate the families at different locations was not achieved during the
period of the last programme. The current situation has been reviewed as part of the preparation
process for this programme. Four families resident on the site have expressed a preference for

"That Limerick City Council bring the Limerick Culture Garden back to Limerick after the
completion of the Bloom in the Park 2014 event held in Dublin”.

Cllr. Kennedy said that the Cultural and Sporting Strategic Policy Committee should have a bigger
input into City of Culture programme and events. He suggested that additional events be organised
to promote native music, art and theatre in the city. He complimented the Archives Department on
the recent three day seminar which was held. He pointed out that some of the graveyards in the
county are neglected and asked that they receive attention.

Cllr. Hourigan pointed out that the City Arts Officer circulated a very comprehensive report on the
City of Culture events organised and added that schools and organisations are being worked with
very closely in relation to music, funding for which is available.

Cllr. J. Leddin extended congratulations to Mike Fitzpatrick on his appointment as Director of City
of Culture. He welcomed the promotion of City of Culture events on the website but pointed out
that not everyone is IT friendly and suggested that a synopsis be put in the local media. He also
suggested that the new Council be given a presentation outlining project updates and events which
have already taken place. He stressed the importance of working with the community / voluntary
sector in the planning for City of Culture as these people have a lot to contribute due to their
involvement in local issues.

Cllr. Gilligan suggested that a ‘one stop shop' be opened in the city for City of Culture, especially as
there are so many vacant properties in the city centre.

Cllr. G. McLoughlin agreed with Cllr. J. Leddin regarding the involvement of the community and
voluntary sector and the opening of a ‘one stop shop' for City of Culture adding that City of Culture
events should be used to promote the city and all it has to offer. He suggested that monies be set
aside to promote and highlight upcoming events in the city.

Cllr. Shortt pointed out that he was on the Board of the Belltable Arts Centre and when it closed it
left a huge void in the cultural life of the city . He expressed hope that it will reopen as an arts
centre. He also has great hopes for a new Arts Centre in the georgian area of the city with a new
Artistic Director and Board. He complimented all concerned who worked very hard to try and keep
the Belltable Arts Centre open.

Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin complimented all involved with City of Culture adding that
it is going very well. She suggested that a rolling screen be erected in the shopping centres and
markets showing the Easter Ceremonies taking place in the Cathedral.

The Manager acknowledged the progress made in relation to the City of Culture adding that a large
programme of events have been organised for the year. He stated that he was very disappointed at
what arose in relation to the Belltable Arts Centre adding that there is a consultation process in
place. City of Culture is very successful in promoting the city resulting in large numbers of people
visiting the city adding that he has received very positive feedback.

Signed : Cllr. Diarmuid Scully

20. NOTICE OF MOTION

Submitted the following Notice of Motion, due notice of which was given, which was adopted
unanimously on the proposition of Cllr. Quinlivan, seconded by Cllr. O'Hanlon :

“Limerick City Council calls on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local
Government, Mr. Phil Hogan T.D., to retain current Local Development Structures. Current
structures have proven to be the most effective way to deliver programmes based on local issues
and needs. In particular, Limerick City Council acknowledges PAUL Partnership's 25 year
expertise in addressing issues of urban disadvantage in Limerick.

The privatisation of programmes delivering local services through the proposed competitive
tendering process will have a detrimental effect on community led local development. It will also
negatively impact the organisation and staff who have many years' experience in delivering a range
of valuable supports that address the needs of citizens, communities and enterprises and increases
social inclusion” Signed : Cllr. Maurice Quinlivan

21. ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Cllr. G. McLoughlin asked that the sand bags which were used during the recent storms be removed

STANDING ORDERS
Standing Orders were suspended for thirty minutes on the proposition of Cllr. Scully, seconded by
Cllr. J. Leddin.

Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin said that this was the last occasion that she would be
speaking in the Chamber either as Mayor or as an Elected Member of the Council. She was deeply
honoured to be able to address all present on what is a historic occasion. She expressed gratitude to
the past and present members and staff of Limerick City Council for their contribution to the

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
development of the city over hundreds of years. In the period since the establishment of Limerick
Corporation in the 12” century, this ancient city of churches has been transformed into a centre of
learning and commerce. She said the modern, thriving city today is testament to the vision and
work of so many Councillors, Mayors and staff members. She said the Council has been very
fortunate to have been served by committed Public Servants whose expertise and hard work has
brought about an absolute transformation of the city during this time.

Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin stated that she will not be contesting the upcoming local
election and said she has decided to retire from politics bringing to an end a journey that started for
her when her late husband, Tim, was a sitting member of the Council. She said over the years the
Council has been involved in many significant infrastructural projects from the Limerick Tunnel to
the development of the riverside area. The Council has also overseen and instigated the
development of Limerick into Ireland's third largest city as well as one of the most attractive
investment locations in the country.

She thanked the staff and Members of Limerick City Council, the people of her Electoral Area, her
family and supporters and wished every success to the Councillors seeking re-election to the new
authority. She also passed on her good wishes to her colleagues Orla McLoughlin, Cormac Hurley
and Kevin Kiely who were not seeking re-election. Finally, she congratulated the Manager and staff
who over the past year have worked closely with the Elected Members to ensure a smooth transition

to a single authority.

The Manager said the Management Team and staff are very proud of the history and legacy of the
ancient city of Limerick and are particularly conscious of the historic civic traditions of public
service and local government embodied by Limerick City Council which date back for over eight
centuries. He said that everybody was gathered today to celebrate, not only the final meeting of
Limerick City Council, but also the rich and varied heritage of the local government system in
Limerick City. The city has transformed itself from a medieval city to a Georgian metropolis and
from a Victorian municipality to a 21* century economic powerhouse. He said that as we move
towards the full merger of Limerick City and County Councils, he is mindful of the importance of
acknowledging the contribution that Limerick Corporation and later Limerick City Council has
made to the City of Limerick. It has overseen the economic and social development of Limerick
into a vibrant and progressive city, a city which is now established as a proven location for
international business with over 13,000 people employed in 100 overseas companies. In recent
times, it has guided the economic, social and physical renaissance of Limerick city centre, the wider
community and Mid West region. Today Limerick is home to progressive third level institutions
with an energetic population of over eighteen thousand students. It is the base for leading
international companies, is served by a quality transport infrastructure, and its vibrant arts
community is the focus of international attention as we celebrate becoming National City of Culture

2014.

The Manager stated that the role of a local authority is vital to the success of the area it governs. As
everyone prepares for a new chapter as Limerick City and County Council, this is a legacy that must
be protected and built on. There is an onus on every Elected Member and member of Council staff
to refocus their collective approach to address the issues and embrace the opportunities faced by the
city and county in the years to come to achieve excellence in Public Service for all the citizens of
Limerick. He said the key for the public is that Local Government maintains its commitment to
providing quality services for all of its customers during such transformational changes.

The Manager stated that the impending merger of Limerick City and County Councils represents a
historic change for the local authorities and marks an important step on the road to achieving
excellence in public service for the citizens of Limerick. He thanked each of the Elected Members,
management and staff, both past and present, for their outstanding contribution to the social and
economic development of Limerick City down through the years. He said he was confident that the

---

new Local Authority would continue to guide the destiny of this ancient and celebrated city for
many more centuries to come.

Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin then presented a scroll to each Member of the City Council
in recognition of their years as a councillor.

The Manager made a presentation of a ceremonial clock and scroll to Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr.
K. Leddin in recognition of her year as Mayor and also of her years as a councillor.

Cllr. Scully, on his own behalf and on behalf of Fine Gael, congratulated Her Worship the Mayor,
Cllr. K. Leddin on her year as Mayor adding that she had a very busy year as she attended a lot of
functions. She was also involved in the largest ever reduction in commercial rates for city
businesses. Limerick is prospering with proposals for the Opera Centre Site and other
developments throughout the city. He wished her well for her retirement. He said the city has been
well served with esteemed Mayors going back to 1197 and before and he welcomed the fact that the
office of the Mayor and status of the Mayor will continue.

Cllr. J. Leddin, on his own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, joined with Cllr. Scully in
congratulating Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr, K. Leddin on an excellent year as Mayor. He
specifically referred to the lange number of functions/events which she attended in a professional
and dignified manner adding that she attended more events than any other previous Mayor. He
wished her every health and happiness in her retirement. He welcomed former Minister O'Malley,
former councillors and officials to this meeting which signifies the closure of a long chapter of the
history of Limerick city. He paid tribute to Matthew Potter on the publication of his book on
Limerick Mayors and said that when he had been elected the 810° Mayor of Limerick it was the
highlight of his career to date. He welcomed the continuation of the Office of Mayor in the new
merged authority. He referred to the fact that the Leddin family have had a long and proud tradition
as a family serving in public life and added that politics is a form of public service which is not easy
but very rewarding. He said this Council is ending at a very exciting time with many plans and
projects underway adding that the city will be unrecognisable in a few years time. Limerick has a
proud history but an equally exciting future.

Cllr. O'Hanlon, on his own behalf and on behalf of Fianna Fail, joined with the previous speakers in
welcoming former Mayors and councillors to the meeting. He gave a special welcome to Des
O'Malley, who was one of the most outstanding Ministers and who Limerick is very proud of. He
paid tribute to Cllr. Kathleen Leddin on her year as Mayor adding that it was a great honour for her
to follow in her husband's footsteps. She handled the office of Mayor with dignity and energy and
he wished her every health and happiness in her retirement. He wished his colleagues every success
in the upcoming elections. He said he himself was the 800" Mayor of the city, something which he
is very proud of. Serving as Mayor can be very challenging and difficult at times but also very
rewarding. He stressed the importance of family support. He said he was not overjoyed with the
amalgamation of city and county, however, the decision is made now so it is important that
everybody gets on with the business of making Limerick a great place to live, work and play in. He
said he looked forward to working with the new Council. He thanked Management and former
Officials. He paid tribute to the excellent staff of the Council who carry out their duties in a very
professional manner. The Manager has very challenging times ahead and wished him every success
for the future.

Cllr. Quinlivan welcomed everybody to this historic meeting and paid tribute to Mayor Cllr. K.
Leddin who had a wonderful year and attended a large amount of events. He said, in his opinion,
amalgamating the city and county is a mistake, the city boundary should have been extended,
however, it is important now to get on with the work in hand. He said he was very proud to have
been elected and is very proud of the work he does and looked forward to working in the new

Council.

Cllr. Kennedy said he wished to avail of this historic opportunity to express his thanks and
appreciation to the people of Limerick for their support over the years. He paid tribute to his wife,
Loretto and his family for their support over the years and said he was proud to say he was a citizen
of Limerick and a councillor for the last forty seven years. He said the best decision he made as a
young man was to leave teaching and become a councillor. He said it is important that councillors
put aside politics and all work together for the betterment of Limerick. He finished with the
following quote 'Ask not what your city can do for you but what you can do for your city’.

Cllr. Gilligan said he served in the Council with excellent people down through the years and paid
tribute to Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin for carrying out her duties as Mayor in an
exemplary and dedicated manner adding that herself and her late husband were the only husband
and wife who both served as Mayor of Limerick. He referred to Cllrs. Gerry and Orla McLoughlin
who are father and daughter and served as Mayor and Deputy Mayor. He also paid tribute to Cllr.
Kennedy who is the longest serving councillor in the country. He too felt it is the wrong decision to
amalgamate city and county adding that Limerick city should have had a boundary extension. It is
important that newly elected councillors ensure that the city's culture, tradition and mayoralty does

not die.

Her Worship the Mayor, Cllr. K. Leddin then made a presentation to Liz Creamer for her service to
the Council over a long number of years and also wished her a happy birthday.

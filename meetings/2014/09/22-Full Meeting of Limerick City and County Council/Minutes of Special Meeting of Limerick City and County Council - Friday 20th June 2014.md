with the Chief Executive’s recommendations dated 11" June, 2014, under Section
20(3)(n) of the Planning and Development Acts, 2000-2014.”

Councillor Galvin asked for an update on the Councils’ position in relation to
possible purchase of a property at Abbeyfeale which was considered strategic to the
proposed Traffic Management Plan for the town.

Members asked for clarification in relation to the procedure for varying an
adopted Local Area Plan and, in particular, if this could be done during the lifetime of
the Plan. The Senior Planner replied indicating that the Council had received legal
advice on this issue and it confirmed that Members could not vary a local area plan
but could amend it. He added that the amendment must be in accordance with the
common good and the proper planning and development of the area.

A short discussion took place in relation to flooding and the Senior Planner
confirmed that when the final CFRAM maps became available, the Local Area Plan
could be amended if there were significant discrepancies.

In the course of the discussion, Councillor Sheahan (J) proposed that the
Council, through the appropriate Strategic Policy Committee, formulate an overall
Planning and Traffic Strategy for County Towns, which would include a provision
whereby the Council could purchase property for sale if considered strategic to the
future development of the area. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Galvin
and agreed.

3. rral Notices to make a new L 1 Ai Plan for Castletro
and extend the existing Plan

Circulated, report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning
dated 11” June, 2014, enclosing copy of the Chief Executive's Report dated 11
June, 2014, on the proposal to extend the life of the Castletroy Local Area Plan

2009-2015.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (M);
Seconded by Councillor Clifford;
And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 19(1)(d) of the Planning and Development
Act 2000 (as amended by Section 12 of the Planning and Development Act 2010),
the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to defer the sending of a Notice
under Section 20(3)(a)(i) and defer publishing a Notice under Section 20(3)(a)(ii) for
Castletroy Local Area Plan 2009-2015 for a further period of 5 years.”

Replying to questions regarding the unfinished Parkway Valley development,
the Senior Planner advised that the report currently with the Members on the
extension of the Castletroy Local Area Plan stated that the anomaly in zoning in
regard to the Parkway Valley would be addressed by an amendment to the Local
Area Plan after the planning permissions for the Parkway Valley expired in 2016. He
further explained that the Parkway Valley development was permitted in 2006 under
the previous Joint Retail Strategy for the Mid-West Region 2003-2011. This Strategy
stated that the potential for significant retail development could not be met in
Limerick City Centre in the short term and should be met within the Metropolitan
Area. The Parkway Valley subsequently sought to extend the life of the planning
permissions to 2016. The only question that could be considered in these extension
applications was whether or not substantial works had been carried out on site. It
was considered that substantial works had been undertaken and this was in
accordance with legal advice received and therefore the permissions were extended
to 2016.

This concluded the Meeting.

An Cathaoirleach

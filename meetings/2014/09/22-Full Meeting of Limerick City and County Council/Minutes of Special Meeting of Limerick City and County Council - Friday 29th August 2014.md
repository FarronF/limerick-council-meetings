in 1999 and the pinnacle of her career was being elected Cathaoirleach of Limerick

County Council. She had been an excellent Cathaoirleach and chaired meetings in

a very fair manner and always offered great advice. The highlights of her year as

Cathaoirleach were the visit of President Michael D. Higgins and honouring her good

friend, Minister Michael Noonan. The one regret Mary had was that her beloved

father did not live to see her elected Cathaoirleach. They stated that Mary would be

sadly missed by her former colleagues, family, friends and community.

Members referred to the fact that she was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in

October 2012 but despite this diagnosis she kept working until the very end. She

bore her illness with great dignity and spirit and attended functions right up to the

end. They referred to the very successful walk which had been held in Pallasgrean

with all the proceeds going to the Motor Neurone Association and Mary was

delighted with the wonderful support on that day. Mary also encouraged the Ice

Bucket Challenge where all proceeds were going to the same Association. It was

stated that this was an extremely hard and difficult time for her family who took such

wonderful care of her during her illness.

Members referred to Mary as a very kind, caring, compassionate and sincere

person. She was an excellent public representative who represented her area very

well and was a wonderful Cathaoirleach who carried out her role with distinction.

The dignity with which she bore her illness was testimony to her strength of

character, will power and determination, traits which she showed throughout her life.

Mary was an inspiration to everyone since she was diagnosed with Motor Neurone

Disease in October 2012. Members paid tribute to her wonderful carers, many of

whom were former students, and stated that Mary was invited to many weddings of

former students which was testimony to her popularity.

Mary had a great interest in people and was a real people’s person. She was also a

fantastic ambassador for Limerick, especially during her term as Cathaoirleach. She

carried out her duties in her many roles throughout life in a very professional and fair

manner and always tried to find solutions to problems or conflicts. She brought a

great sense of humour and fun to the office of Cathaoirleach. A light had gone out in

East Limerick with the passing of Mary but her memory would live on in the minds of

all the people who had the pleasure of knowing her.

The Chief Executive paid tribute to Mary on his own behalf and on behalf of the staff

and extended sincere sympathy to her family, community and friends. He stated that

he had not had the pleasure of getting to know Mary well but she was firm and fair

and had brought great leadership to the Council Chamber and indeed to the merger.

He said he was delighted to be at the Meeting to pay his respects to her.

The Cathaoirleach expressed his gratitude to the local community and all involved in

the organisation of this Special Meeting. He pointed out that the staff of Limerick

City and County Council had donated €3,000 to the Motor Neurone Association from

its Benevolent Fund.

**PRESIDENT MICHAEL D. HIGGINS – FREEDOM OF LIMERICK:**

The Cathaoirleach stated that President Michael D. Higgins had agreed to accept the

Freedom of Limerick and he proposed that this honour would be bestowed on him on

29th September, 2014, in recognition of his unique contribution to Irish life. The

Cathaoirleach also stated that it was particularly appropriate as President Higgins

was sole Patron of Limerick City of Culture.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (K);

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J);

And Resolved:

“That, the Freedom of Limerick be conferred on President Michael D. Higgins.”

The Cathaoirleach then asked the Members to stand for a Silent Prayer.

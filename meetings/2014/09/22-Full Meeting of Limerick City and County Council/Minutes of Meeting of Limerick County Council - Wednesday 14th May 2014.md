The Senior Executive Planner outlined the procedure to be adhered to following

receipt of the Managers Report, including the making of amendments which would
constitute material alterations to the proposed Plan.

1.

Council Scanlan proposed two amendments to the Draft Plan as follows:

“| recommend that the land referred to in Submission 116 is zoned Enterprise and Employment.

The main and fundamental planning reason for retention of zoning is the lands contribution to the
delivery of the proposed southern distributor road, a key and fundamental element of the strategy
for the future development of Newcastle West. The recent NRDO Docking points survey identified
the most appropriate docking point to be at these lands, Docking point E3 which lays entirely at
these lands. The lands development therefore offers the potential to deliver the docking point for

the future by-pass.

As the strategy for the delivery of the road cannot solely depend on public finances and must in
some way be delivered in conjunction with private interests, the zoning of these lands is wholly
justified in that it can deliver on a key objective set out in the draft Local Area Plan. The likelihood
of this happening with the lands de-zoned would be zero.

Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Local Area Plans published in June 2013 say that one of the
key messages in their preparation is:

“Planning Authorities must engage with the providers of essential physical and social
infrastructure to ensure that Local Area Plans are based on realistic assessments as to the funding

and timing of the delivery of such infrastructure.”
Section 6.1 on Local Area Plans and Infrastructure Provision states:

“Planning Authorities should therefore seek to implement the aims, policies and objectives of the
Local Area Plan in a proactive manner harnessing all available public and private funding avenues
to support Local Area Plan implementation.”

Mid-West Strategic Plan 2012 states:

“In the absence of full alignment upgrades, consideration must be immediately given to localised
by-passes for the towns of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.”

There has already been significant co-operation between the owner of this land and Limerick
County Council in the design of a roundabout and distributor road through this land and
recognition by Limerick County Council as to the privately funded delivery of such infrastructure (if
necessary). Zoning of this land ‘Enterprise & Employment’ could provide an avenue for private or
public/private partnership delivery of important infrastructure at the chosen Docking Point E
which would be highly unlikely if the land was zoned ‘Agriculture.’

2. 1! recommend an increase in the area of open space as indicated on the map submitted (additional
open space area of 0.58 hectares). This change is in line with the proper planning and sustainable
development of the area in that it will provide additional open space for the residents in the area
and is in line with objectives C1- C3 in the proposed Local Area Plan. it is considered that this
change will not have any negative environmental impacts. All text and tables, including table 11.1
shall be amended to take this change into account".

The amendments were seconded by Councillor Collins (M).

It was noted that the proposed Local Area Plan would go on public display for a
further 4 weeks giving members of the public an opportunity to comment on the
proposed amendments only. This would be followed by the preparation of a second
Manager's Report to the Members on any submissions received on the proposed

amendments.

Molta ag Councillor Scanlan;
Cuidit 6n Councillor Collins (M);
Agus an Cinneadh:

“That, the proposed material alterations to the proposed Newcastle West
Local Area Plan 2014-2020, as recommended in the Manager's Report dated 14" April,
2014, be put on public display for the statutory period under section 20(3)(e-h) of the
Planning and Development Acts 2000-2013, together with the following amendments

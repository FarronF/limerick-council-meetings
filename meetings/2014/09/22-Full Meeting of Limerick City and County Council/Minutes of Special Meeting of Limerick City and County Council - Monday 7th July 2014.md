16(a) Newcastle West Local Area Plan 2014-2020

Circulated, report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning
dated 30" June, 2014, enclosing copy of the Chief Executive's Report dated 30th
June, 2014, on the proposed Newcastle West Local Area Plan 2014-2020.

The Director's report stated that the material amendments to the Proposed
Local Area Plan had been placed on public display from Saturday, 24" May, to
Monday, 23” June, 2014 inclusive. During that period, a total of 9 submissions had
been received. A report consisting of a summary of the 9 submissions received,
together with recommendations, was circulated as required by Section (3) (k) of the
Planning and Development Acts, 2000-2014.

Councillor Scanlan proposed that the Newcastle West Local Area Plan 2014-
2020 be made, with the following Amendment and this was seconded by Councillor

Collins (M):

“In relation to the Department of the Environment and Regional Authority
submission to consider removing the enterprise and employment land on the north-
east periphery, | recommend that this land is zoned for Enterprise and Employment
land, as per the Material Alterations Public Display Document dated 24” May, 2014,
for the following reasons:

The main and fundamental planning reason for retention of zoning is the lands
contribution to the delivery of the proposed southern distributor road, a key and
fundamental element of the strategy for the future development of Newcastle West. The
recent NRDO Docking points survey identified the most appropriate docking point to be at
these lands, Docking point E3 which lays entirely at these lands. The lands development
therefore offers the potential to deliver the docking point for the future by-pass.

As the strategy for the delivery of the road cannot solely depend on public finances and
must in some way be delivered in conjunction with private interests, the zoning of these
lands is wholly justified in that it can deliver on a key objective set out in the draft Local
Area Plan. The likelihood of this happening with the lands de-zoned would be zero.

Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Local Area Plans published in June 2013 say that
one of the key messages in their preparation is:

“Planning Authorities must engage with the providers of essential physical and social
infrastructure to ensure that Local Area Plans are based on realistic assessments as to the
funding and timing of the delivery of such infrastructure.”

Section 6.1 on Local Area Plans and Infrastructure Provision states:
“Planning Authorities should therefore seek to implement the aims, policies and objectives

of the Local Area Plan in a proactive manner harnessing all available public and private
funding avenues to support Local Area Plan implementation.”

Mid-West Strategic Plan 2012 states:

“In the absence of full alignment upgrades, consideration must be immediately given to
localised by-passes for the towns of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.”

There has already been significant co-operation between the owner of this land and
Limerick County Council in the design of a roundabout and distributor road through this
land and recognition by Limerick County Council as to the privately funded delivery of such
infrastructure (if necessary). Zoning of this land ‘Enterprise & Employment’ could provide
an avenue for private or public/private partnership delivery of important infrastructure at
the chosen Docking Point E which would be highly unlikely if the land was zoned
‘Agriculture.’

A lengthy discussion took place on the Plan and some Members expressed concern
in relation to the proposed zoning which they felt would detract from the town.

The Senior Planner, in response to a query, confirmed that the Plan could be
amended at any stage during its life.

Councillor Collins (M) stated that he had received new information relevant to the
proposal to zone the lands. He stated that the landowner of the said lands was
proposing to build a Community Facility on same which could be used as a Tourist
Office. Furthermore, it was noted that the landowner was proposing to build a
roundabout and a portion of the distributor road as part of the proposed
development. Councillor Collins (M) said it was not the intention to zone lands for out
of town retail development but to allow for the construction of a distributor road for

Newcastle West.

The Chief Executive stated that it was ultimately a decision of the Elected Members.
He said it was time to make the Plan and that it could and should be revisited during
its life. He said that the recommendations were set out in the Chief Executive's
Report. However, as there was a proposal to make the Plan with an Amendment, a
vote would be required.

The Meetings Administrator clarified that a vote would be taken to make the Plan
with Amendment proposed by Councillor Scanlan.

The result of the voting was as follows:

For:

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Clifford, Collins (J), Collins (M), Crowley, Daly, Donegan,
Foley, Galvin, Gleeson, Hourigan, Hurley, Keary, Lynch, Mitchell, Neville, O’Brien,
O'Dea, O'Donnell, O'Donoghue, O'Hanlon, Ryan, Scanlan, Secas, Sheahan (J),

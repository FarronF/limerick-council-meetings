following into the Minutes:

Rationale for ing Variations

“The rationale for the proposed variations to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan and the
Limerick County Development Plan has been clearly set out when the variation process was
initiated by the Council and remains valid. The proposed variations will deliver a framework
which continues to restrict the size of neighbourhood centres to ensure that they perform in
accordance with their defined function. The limitations on size set out in the variations are
more restrictive than in most other similar urban areas in Ireland and go well beyond the
requirements of the Retail Planning Guidelines in this respect.

The variations would facilitate the potential consideration of planning applications, subject to
detailed assessment, of a small supermarket to help overcome the current need for residents to
travel out of the Southern Environs area in particular to avail of a good choice of small
supermarket offer and help address the recognised deficiencies of this particular form of
retailing and limited consumer choice in this area.

The variations still limit neighbourhood centres to a modest size and would not permit
neighbourhood centres to grow to an extent that would lead to a risk of detrimental impact upon
the vitality and viability of other designated centres. It is considered that the provision of a
limited number of small supermarkets in designated neighbourhood centres in the Southern
Environs area of Limerick and the Metropolitan area generally will not give rise to potential
impact on Limerick City Centre and will not result in any material diversion of trade from the City
Centre, given the existing distribution of small supermarkets and discount foodstores in district
and neighbourhood centres in Metropolitan Limerick. Likewise, it will not have the potential to
materially impact on district centres. The only district centre in the Southern Environs area is
the Crescent Shopping Centre which provides a primarily comparison retail function of regional
significance and is a very strongly performing district centre and would not be likely to be
materially adversely impacted upon by the modest growth of neighbourhood centres in the
southern environs.

Any future small supermarket proposal would in any event have to be assessed for compliance
with the Limerick County and Mid West Retail Strategies and would have to satisfy the relevant
criteria and tests of the Retail Planning Guidelines, including retail impact.

The variations are therefore considered to be consistent with the Mid West Retail Strategy and
the Retail Planning Guidelines for Planning Authorities.”

Proposed Amendments to Limerick County Development Plan 2010 - 2016

The variation proposes the following amendments to the Limerick County Development Plan 2010 - 2016:

. Replace the reference in Section 10.6.4.3 of the County Development Pian to the size of neighbourhood
centres being restricted to 900 sq.m gross convenience floorspace with a restriction of 1,400 sq.m net
convenience floor area in neighbourhood centres in the Limerick urban area (i.e. the areas covered by the
Southern Environs LAP 2011 — 2017 and the Castletroy LAP 2009 — 2015).

Replace (1* bullet point at Section 10.6.4.3)

“Within designated Neighbourhood Centres the gross convenience shopping floor area should not exceed 900sqm
in area.”

With:

"Within designated Neighbourhood Centres in the Limerick Urban Area the net convenience shopping floor area
should not exceed 1,400 sq.m in area.

In the context of Limerick City and its environs the priority shall be to locate large retail developments in town and
city centre locations.

Any future development in neighbourhood centres will be required to ensure that the neighbourhood centre
complies with the definition of neighbourhood centres as set out at Page 54 of the Retail Planning Guidelines 2012,
which is that neighbourhood centres “comprise a smail group of shops, typically comprising newsagent, small
supermarket/ general grocery store, sub-post office and other small shops of a local nature serving a small,
localised catchment population”.

viron Area Plan
The variation proposes the following amendments to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan:
Replace Policy ED8 of the Southern Environs LAP which restricts the size of neighbourhood centres to 900 sq.m

gross convenience floorspace with a restriction of 1,400 sq.m net convenience floorspace in neighbourhood
centres. Omit the reference to no comparison floorspace permitted in neighbourhood centres.

Replace (Policy ED8):
“It is an objective of Limerick County Council in relation to neighbourhood and village centres, to:

a. Support the provision of modern convenience goods stores, of an appropriate scale, and associated retail and
service units to enable these centres to meet the day to day needs of their local catchment population.

b. Within Neighbourhood Centres the gross convenience shopping floor area shall not exceed 900sqm in area and
no new comparison floor space will be permitted”.

With:
“It is an objective of Limerick County Council in relation to neighbourhood and village centres, fo:

a. Support the provision of modern convenience goods stores, of an appropriate scale, and associated retail and
service units to enable these centres to meet the day to day needs of their local catchment population.

In the context of Limerick City and its environs the priority shall be to locate large retail developments in town and
city centre locations.

Any future development in neighbourhood centres will be required to ensure that the neighbourhood centre
complies with the definition of neighbourhood centres at set out at Page 54 of the Retail Planning Guidelines 2012,
which is that neighbourhood centres “comprise a small group of shops, typically comprising newsagent, small
supermarkel/ general grocery store, sub-post office and other small shops of a local nature serving a small,
localised catchment population”.

b. Within Neighbourhood Centres the net convenience shopping fioor area shall not exceed 1,400 sq.m in area. The
role of neighbourhood centres should not be allowed to expand to encompass a materially broader range of
comparison goods than currently exists in such areas as this could Jead to further competition with the City Centre.
In addition, any comparison floorspace in a neighbourhood centre shall comprise a secondary element of the overall
floorspace representing not more than 20% of the net floor area of a single unit.

Reasons and Considerations
The definition of neighbourhood centres in the Retail Planning Guidelines (2012) is as follows:


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

“Comprise a small group of shops, typically comprising newsagent, small supermarket/ general grocery store, sub-
post office and other small shops of a local nature serving a small, localised catchment population”.

This definition is incorporated into the proposed variation. The definition does not contain any restriction on the
quantum of convenience floorspace in neighbourhood centres. The potential future development of a small
supermarket / discount foodstore would be in accordance with the definition of a neighbourhood centre.

There are numerous examples of where local planning authorities and An Bord Pleandla has granted planning
permission for small supermarkets / discount foodstores in neighbourhood centres in the region of 1,000 sq.m net
floorspace in individual stores in urban areas.

The proposed variation does not in itself provide that approval will be forthcoming for the provision of a small
supermarket / discount foodstore in any particular case and does not seek any additional zoning or designation. The
consideration of such a development would need to be undertaken pursuant to a planning application, having
regard to the relevant planning policy context at national, regional and local level.

There is no quantitative restriction on the size of convenience stores in neighbourhood centres set out in the
Regional Planning Guidelines for the Mid West Region 2010 — 2016 or the Retail Strategy for the Mid West Region
2010 — 2016. It is further noted that other Development Plans in the Mid West region, i.e. the Limerick City
Development Plan 2010 — 2016, the Clare County Development Plan 2011 - 2017, and the North Tipperary County
Development Plan 2010 - 2016, do not contain quantitative restrictions on the size of convenience stores in

neighbourhood centres.

The proposed variation is considered to be consistent with the Core Strategy of the Limerick County Development
Plan 2010 - 2016. The Core Strategy does not include any prohibition or restriction on the size of small
supermarket / discount foodstore development in neighbourhood centres. The Core Strategy refers to Policy ED11
of the County Development Pian, which states that:

“It is the policy of the Council only to facilitate retail development where it is in accordance with

a) Retail Planning Guidelines, Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DEHLG) 2005, and
any subsequent amendments thereof.

b) The Joint Retail Strategy for Limerick City, Limerick County and Clare insofar as it applies to the County,
including any subsequent amendments thereof”.

It has been set out above that the proposed variation will ensure that the Limerick County Development Plan and
Southern Environs Local Area Plan is fully compliant with the Retail Planning Guidelines (2012). In particular, the
proposed variation incorporates the town centre first policy advocated by the Retail Planning Guidelines and the
definition of neighbourhood centres as set out in the Guidelines. It will be detailed below how the proposed variation
is in accordance with the Retail Strategy for the Mid West 2010 — 2016.

It is recognised that there is a significant gap in the convenience retail provision in the Southern Environs area. The
proposed variation will allow for the consideration of proposals which might help address this deficit. The proposed
variation would not in itself provide for any additional floorspace. Such additional floorspace would need to be
considered by way of a planning application. The proposed variation seeks to adjust the threshold for the size of
convenience stores in neighbourhood centres.

It is well established that small supermarkets / discount foodstores in the region of 1,000 sq.m net floorspace are
appropriate in neighbourhood centres in large urban areas in Ireland. The proposed variation will bring the policy of
the County Development Pian and the Southern Environs LAP in to line with the policy prevailing in other similar

urban areas.
It is noted that the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Mid West states at Page 66 that:

“Prioritisation of town and city centre locations for large retail developments. In the context of Limerick City and its
environs such developments should be reserved for the City Centre”.

This wording is incorporated into the proposed variation and as such the proposed variation is, by definition, fully in
compliance with the Regional Planning Guidelines in this respect. The variation does not seek to provide for any
additional zoning which would have the potential to impact upon the city centre.

The Retail Strategy for the Mid West Region specifically recognises the function of neighbourhood and village
centres at paragraph 49, stating that:

“Within the Metropolitan Area these centres comprise smail local parades with very limited car parking which meet
the daily needs of a very local area. Their function is extremely important locally to meet ‘top-up’ convenience goods
shopping needs (i.e. those products which need replacing between main food shopping trips) and to provide local
services, including the provision of takeaway food. From a policy perspective they are also important as they
constitute a sustainable provision of retailing, removing the need to travel and also thereby reducing levels of

congestion”.

The development of a small supermarket / discount foodstore would overcome the current need for residents to
travel out of the Souther Environs area to avail of a good choice of small supermarket / discount foodstore offer
and help address the recognised deficiencies of this particular form of retailing in this area. It would promote
sustainable travel patterns and would reduce the reliance on the private car, in accordance with the aims and
objectives of the national and regional planning policy context.

It is noted that the Retail Strategy for the Mid-West Region 2010 — 2016 states at Paragraph 6.34 that “the
quantitative retail floorspace assessment does not Wentify any material need for additional convenience goods
floorspace over the study period for the region as a whole if existing commitments are built. As with comparison
goods, therefore, there is no need to allocate or approve further out of centre floorspace. Whilst there maybe local
qualitative deficiencies to be rectified, a town centre first approach should be deployed to meet any such need”.

The following comments are made in respect of the above:

. As has previously been set out, the proposed variation does not seek to allocate any additional zoning and
does not seek any new designation, The variation proposes only to amend the quantitative restriction on the
total quantum of convenience floorspace in neighbourhood centres.

. There is no out of centre retailing proposed. The proposed variation follows the town centre first approach,
as specifically referred to in the wording of the proposed variation. There are a number of existing
neighbourhood centre designations and the proposed variation seeks to ensure that the policies and
objectives of the Limerick County Development Plan 2010 — 2016 and the Southern Environs Local Area
Plan 2011 — 2017 for these centres are consistent with the national and regional planning policy by allowing
the consideration of appropriately scaled small supermarket / discount foodstore development at
neighbourhood centre locations.

. Paragraph 6.34 of the Retail Strategy accepts that there may be local qualitative deficiencies in the
convenience retail provision. A quantitative assessment has been carried out and there is a deficiency of
this form of local retailing in the southern environs area. Detailed consideration of capacity would need to be
undertaken at planning application stage. In addition, Paragraph 6.51 of the Retail Strategy states that: “The
strategy for neighbourhood centres, small towns and village centres is to:- Support the provision of modern
convenience goods stores, of an appropriate scale, and associated retail and service units to enable these
centres to meet the day to day needs of their local catchment population”. The Retail Strategy therefore
specifically supports the further appropriate development of neighbourhood centres.

It is considered that the provision of small supermarkets in designated neighbourhood centres in the Southern
Environs area of Limerick is unlikely to have any material adverse impact on any existing centre and vill not impact
whatsoever on Limerick City Centre and will not result in any diversion of trade from the City Centre, given the
existing distribution of small supermarkets and discount foodstores in district and neighbourhood centres in
metropolitan Limerick. Such an approach would lead to a greater choice for consumers.

In terms of the existing ban on new comparison floorspace in neighbourhood centres, the regional planning policy
context, as set out in the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Mid West Region 2010 — 2016 and the Retail
Strategy for the Mid West Region 2010 — 2016 does not seek to prohibit a small element of comparison goods
being sold from convenience stores in neighbourhood centres.

The Retail Planning Strategy for the Mid West Region 2010 — 2016 at Paragraph 6.11 refers to centres outside the
city centre and states that:


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

“Those centres in the Metropolitan Area meeting the day to day needs of a local catchment population through the
provision of main food shopping outlets should be supported and reinvigorated where necessary. However, their
role should not be allowed fo expand to encompass a materially broader range of comparison goods as this could
lead to further competition with the City Centre. There should be no new permissions granted for additional out of
centre retailing, including the extension of any existing store or retail park, and the broadening of the range of goods
sold to encompass any categories other than bulky goods. Similarly these centres and retail parks should not be
expanded beyond a scale appropriate for a suburban shopping location in Limerick. Consequently, there should not
be any expansion of these shopping facilities in order to allow the City Centre to foster investment and improve its
trading position”.

In order to ensure that the policy of the Southern Environs Local Area Plan and Limerick County Development Plan
are consistent with the Regional Retail Strategy in respect of comparison goods it is proposed to reflect the
requirement at Paragraph 6.11 (i.e. the role of neighbourhood centres “should not be allowed to expand to
encompass a materially broader range of comparison goods as this could lead to further competition with the City
Centre’) to the variation.

There is a small element of comparison goods provided in all neighbourhood centres. Such comparison goods are
typically lower to medium order goods. Examples of such goods would include personal care products such as
toiletries, newspapers and magazines, etc. Most small supermarkets therefore provide an element of comparison
goods and therefore an absolute ban on comparison goods is not considered appropriate.

The wording of the proposed amendment goes further than the Regional Planning Strategy by proposing an
additional restriction that any comparison floorspace in a neighbourhood centre shall comprise a secondary element
of the overall floorspace representing not more than 20% of the net floor area of a single unit.

Appropriate Assessment
The Planning Authority has determined, using the screening criteria set out in Schedule 2A Planning and

Development Regulations 2001-2004, the DOEHLG SEA Guidelines and Annex 2 of Directive 2001/42/EC, that a
Strategic Environmental Assessment is not required for the proposed variation.

An Appropriate Assessment Screening was undertaken of the proposed variation of the Limerick County
Development Pian, in accordance with the requirements of Article 6(3) of the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).
The proposed variation is not predicted to have a likely impact on the key features or the conservation function of

any Natura 200 sites.

The proposal for the Variation to the Limerick County Development Plan 2010-2016, and
the Amendment to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011-2017, as proposed by
Councillor Hannon, was seconded by Councillor Butler.

confident that the new Authority would ensure that Limerick remained a vibrant place to live in,
work in and visit and one that would continue to prosper in terms of economic development,
tourism, community engagement and active citizenship. There was an onus on every Elected
Member and member of Council staff to refocus their collective approach to address the
challenges and embrace the opportunities that would face them in the years to come.

The impending merger of Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council, he said,
represented an historic change for the local authorities. He outlined that the amalgamation
represented a unique opportunity for the Council to ensure there would be one voice and one
vision for Limerick. As one of the largest local authorities in the state, he said the new Authority
was well placed to play a leading role in the economic development of Limerick City and County
for many years to come. He concluded by thanking the Elected Members, Management and
Staff, both past and present, for their outstanding contribution to the social and economic
development of Limerick down through the years.

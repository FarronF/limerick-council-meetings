The Superintendent responded to Members questions as follows:

Gardai to liaise with the Council with a view to installing CCTV cameras in Fr. Casey
Close, Abbeyfeale.

An undertaking was given to provide a Resident Guard in the Glin area shortly.

Regarding the Community Alert Programme, the Superintendent outlined that the Scheme
worked on the principle of shared responsibility for crime prevention and reduction
between the Community and An Garda Siochana. The aims of the Programme were to
reduce opportunities for crimes to occur, to foster the process of community development
and to devise programmes to improve the quality of life for all in rural communities. The
Superintendent informed Members that Sergeant Denis Woods had been appointed as co-
ordinator in the area and that a data base was being set-up of all contact personnel.

Regarding increased illegal drug activities in the District and the violence associated with
drugs, the Superintendent stated that he intended to target those people using national
resources. He also stated that the “Text Alert” system would be of benefit to the
community, adding that a number of plans had been put into operation to counteract
criminals travelling from outside the area.

It was stated that work was ongoing in relation to the re-establishment and strengthening
of the Joint Policing Committee and that there was a requirement for a 6 Year Strategic
Plan.

In relation to the problem of boy racers, particularly in Abbeyfeale and Dromcollogher, the
Superintendent said that he would work with the Community Alert to alleviate the problem.

It was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Collins and agreed to
write to the Department of Social Protection requesting that the use of Dates of Birth
(DOB) normally used in relation to transactions with Public Bodies be replaced by PPSN
Nos. (Personal Public Service Nos.).

3. Customer Services:

The Executive Architect circulated to Members copy plans of the Proposed Refurbishment
Works/Customer Service Improvements to be undertaken at Council Offices, Newcastle
West. She outlined that it was proposed to divide the two existing Meeting Rooms into
three individual rooms comprising of Conference Room, Interview Room and Members’
Room. In response to queries, Ms. McEvoy stated that the works, if approved, would go to
tender shortly. She envisioned that refurbishment works would commence early in the
New Year and would take approx. 1 — 2 months to complete.

Members expressed concern that, should this plan go ahead, the existing rooms could not
be opened up into one big meeting room and, therefore, could not cater for bigger
functions/Civil Receptions. Members stated that they were not accepting the design as
outlined and they requested that a new proposal be put on the next Agenda.

Further discussions took place and the Members proposed that the Conference Room and
Interview Room should remain downstairs, while the Members’ Room should be located
upstairs. Members requested that the Member’s Room be equipped with phones, printers

and photocopiers.

Members also expressed concern about not having access to the Main Offices. Following
discussions on the matter, Members strongly requested that they be granted access to
staff in the Main Offices.

NOTICES OF MOTION

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will move at the next Meeting that Danaher’s building should be purchased at the
end of Colbert's Street to alleviate the traffic problems in the town.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that this property be purchased as a
matter of urgency to help alleviate the traffic problems in Abbeyfeale.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Foley stressed the importance of a Traffic
Management Plan for the town, which would incorporate the purchase of this property.

A short discussion ensued on this Motion and, again, it was stressed that a Traffic
Management Plan was urgently required for the town.

REPLY: There is considerable merit in acquiring this building from a transportation
perspective. Clearly, its acquisition would be dependant on a funding source
being made available to purchase the property at a reasonable price.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will move at the next Meeting that this Council takes immediate measures to
survey all estates in our charge to reduce the speed limit as asked by Minister
Paschal Donohoe following a campaign by the family of the late Jake Brennan.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that adequate safety measures should
be put in place at entrances to housing estates, to include play signs, speed limits and

speed ramps.

Councillor Foley seconded the Motion.

REPLY: This will be considered as part of a County wide initiative to respond to
DTTAS Circular RSB 01 2014 on the Control of Vehicle Speeds in Housing
Estates.

10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council restore the
practice of issuing listings of offered tenancies to Councillors within the Newcastle

West Municipal District.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that this item be included on the
next Party Leader's Agenda.

Councillor Galvin seconded the Motion.

REPLY: It was the practice of Limerick County Council to issue details of allocations
to Councillors.

However, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner advised in April
2014 that:

“the release of lists of applicants for housing allocation decisions to elected
representatives constitutes further processing of data in a manner
incompatible with the purposes for which the data was collected. The current
practice by Limerick County Council represents a breach of the Data
Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003.

We require immediate confirmation from your offices that this practice has

now ceased."

Following receipt of the above direction, the Council confirmed to the Office
of the Data Protection Commissioner that the practice had ceased in April
2014.

The Council, therefore, is not in a position to reinstate practices as
requested. However, the Council is anxious to work with the Members to
agree a practise that remains within the law while meeting the needs of
applicants and Councillors. As this issue affects all of the Districts, it is
recommended that a small working group be formed through the Party
Leaders, consisting of Councillors and Officials with a view to making a
future recommendation to Council on this matter.

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, in the interest
of safety, complete footpaths and lighting at Castlemahon Village towards Kilready.
This was planned as part of a Village Renewal Scheme previously but was never

completed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins stated that the completion of footpaths and
lighting were essential near the School and Hall at Castlemahon Village towards Kilready,
in the interest of safety.

Councillor Browne seconded the Motion.

REPLY: This proposal can be considered if development funds become available in
the future.

12. Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

! will move at the next Meeting that the Council provide more street bins for the
town of Abbeyfeale.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Browne stated that additional street bins were required
for Abbeyfeale town. He voiced his concerns that some of the existing bins were being
used for domestic rubbish. He requested that the situation be monitored.

Councillor Galvin seconded the Motion.

REPLY: There is no funding available in the current year for the provision of
additional street bins in Abbeyfeale.

Members welcomed that the Fire Station in Abbeyfeale was re-opened but they stated that
a long-term solution was needed to the on-going problems being experienced by the
Station. Members requested that they be kept up-to-date on the situation.

Members queried the up-to-date position on road works being carried out on the N21.
Director outlined that works were very difficult due to the high volume of traffic passing
through. He acknowledged that local businesses were suffering since works commenced
but he stated that two-way traffic would be restored on 20" November, 2014.

Members were also informed that utility companies would be contacted in advance of any
road works taking place to ascertain if upgrades were required.

This concluded the Meeting.

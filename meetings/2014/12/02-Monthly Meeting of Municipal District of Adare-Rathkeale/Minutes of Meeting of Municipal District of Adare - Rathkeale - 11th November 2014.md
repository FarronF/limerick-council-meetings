looked at.

3. Economic Development and Planning
(a) Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021

Circulated, report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning dated 4”
November, 2014, enclosing copy of the Chief Executive's Report to Members dated 4"
November, 2014, on the proposed Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021.

The Chief Executive's Report presented the submissions made following publication of the
proposed Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021 and set out the Chief Executive's responses
to the issues raised and any amendments to the proposed Local Area Plan. It was noted
that the proposed Plan was placed on public display from Saturday, 6” September, 2014,
to Monday, 20” October, 2014, inclusive and that a total of 31 written submissions were
received within the statutory timeframe. The formal making of the Local Area Plan was by
resolution of the Municipal District. During the Local Area Plan process, the Council must
consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, statutory
obligations and any relevant plans and policies of the Government or any Minister of the
Government.

The Senior Executive Planner outlined the procedure to be adhered to following receipt of
the Chief Executive's report, including the making of amendments which would constitute
material alterations to the proposed Plan.

Councillor Neville proposed the following amendments to the Draft Plan as follows:

“(i). + In_relation to submission no 16, 17 and 18 the land at The

thatched Cottage, Main St Adare in relation to change of use from residential
to commercial and/or dual use remove objective H4(c) and objective (EH 1)
and any other text in the plan that refers to prohibiting the change of use of
thatched cottages from residential to commercial / dual use for the following

reasons

a. In relation to section 4.4 of the proposed Adare LAP 2015 - 2021 it states it
is important that the existing thatched buildings are retained and maintained.
In contravention to objective EH1 and objective EH4(c) of the plan the most
appropriate way of maintaining these buildings is allowing their use for
commercial or dual purposes. At present these dwellings not in commercial
use are derelict and do not fulfil modern residential demands, facilities or

---

(ii).

size. The continuation of current residential zoning will compound and
elongate the dereliction which contradicts the rationale for zoning them
residential in the first place. For this reason the removal of objective H4(c)
and EH 1 and any other text in the plan that refers to prohibiting the change of
use of thatched cottages from residential to commercial / dual use is
required.

b. Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 states that these cottages are the villages unique
selling point and a must see location. This attracts volumes of tourists to
these cottages. They take photographs/videos and also visit thatched
cottages which are already in commercial use. The privacy implications for
proposed residents of these dwellings due their photographic attraction
stifles demand for their use as a home.

c. As stated in Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 these cottages are a must see. If they
remain zoned residential they will remain derelict with proprietors unable to
afford their upkeep and thus threaten their very character. Also as they are a
must see attraction, zoning these cottages commercial/dual will give the
public an opportunity to see their inside decor as well as the outside
character. This will crystallize their unique selling point of the village.

d. Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 states there are to be no installation of satellite
dishes or aerials on the cottages. When acquiring a modern home satellite
dishes and aerials are now the norm. This again emphasises that these
cottages will not be in demand or suitable as modern residential housing.

e. Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 states that incompatible changes of use or proposals
for dual residential/commercial/office use are a threat to the thatched
cottages. Again this is not the case due to the reasons outlined in (a) (b) (c)
above.

f. The use of signage for commercial purposes will be allowed on a
reasonable basis in keeping with the existing commercial activity already in
use by some of these thatched cottages.

g. Allowing commercial activity in these thatched cottages will help create
local sustainable employment thus adding to Adare's unique selling point -
Tourism.

!n_ relation to submission no 27 the zoning of lands at Deerpark shall be
changed to residential — phase 2 and residential serviced sites — phase 2 as
indicated on the attached map (Councillor Neville submitted map outlining the
proposed site and this map is attached). The following objective shall be
included in Chapter 8 of the proposed plan:

Objective EH10: Trees on lands at Deerpark
There are a significant proportion of existing trees on the land zoned as

phase 2 residential and phase 2 serviced sites at Deepark. Any future
development on these lands shall incorporate as many of the trees as

possible into the scheme. A comprehensive tree survey carried out by a
suitably qualified person shall be submitted with any future planning
application.

Tables 3.4 and 10.1 to be amended accordingly

Reasons

It will provide more of a variety of sites given that a significant area of land in
Adare is indicated as liable to flooding and having regard to the amount of
land that has been de-zoned.

This will not affect the population targets set out in the core strategy as the
land is proposed as phase 2.

It is considered that this change is not significant in terms of SEA/AA
requirements particularly having regard to the inclusion of Objective EH10 in
relation to the trees.

In_relation to submission no 37 the land at Islandea, Adare shall be
changed to existing residential.

Reasons
These lands form the curtilage of the existing house.
The lands were previously zoned residential in the 2009 LAP.

Any application on this site would require compliance with Objective IN5
Flood Risk Management of the proposed plan in relation to flood risk
assessment.

In_relation to lands connecting Deerpark, Adare and the Rathkeale
Road, Adare that the portion thereof currently occupied and controlled by

Adare Soccer Club be rezoned from Residential Development Area Phase 1 to
Open Space and Recreation;

Reasons

Adare Soccer Club has occupied and controlled the aforesaid portion of
ground, delineated as the soccer club grounds, in excess of 20 years and it
would be contrary to proper planning to continue to zone this as Residential
Development Area Phase 1.

It is the objective of the Council to seek the provision of well designed,
accessible and high quality and useable open space in all residential
development in accordance with the County Development Plan and the
zoning of Adare Soccer Club portion of ground at Deerpark from Residential
Development Area Phase 1 to Open Space compliments these guidelines.

e The Adare Area Plan has zoned 34.54 hectares as Residential Development
Area Phase 1 and 13.66 hectares Residential Development Area Phase 2.
Accordingly the Adare Area Plan currently has land zoned that is expected to
meet the population target for the proposed plan period.”

The amendments were seconded by Councillor O'Brien and agreed.

Some discussion followed in relation to Submission 6 and Submissions 27-30. The Senior
Executive Planner outlined her concerns in relation to potential risk of flooding in these
areas. She further stated that any changes proposed needed to be precise and give
sufficient planning reasons for deviating from the Chief Executive’s recommendation and

should be in accordance with proper planning.

It was agreed to defer this Item until the next Meeting on 2°° December, 2014.

(b) Deferral of Notices to make a New Local Area Plan for Croom and
Extend the Existing Plan

Circulated, report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning dated 4"
November, 2014, enclosing copy of the Chief Executive Report to Members dated 4”
November, 2014, on the proposal to extend the life of the Croom Local Area Plan 2009-

2015.

Proposed by Councillor O'Brien;
Seconded by Councillor McMahon;
And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 19(1)(d) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as
amended by Section 12 of the Planning and Development Act 2010), the approval of the
Council be and is hereby given to defer the sending of a Notice under Section 20(3)(a)(i)
and defer publishing a Notice under Section 20(3)(a)(ii) for Croom Local Area Plan 2009-
2015 for a further period of 5 years.”

4. Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

! will ask at the next Meeting for a report regarding the arrangements in place for the
collection of refuse from apartments, particularly 2°" and 3° floor apartments. In
particular, | will ask why green bags are no longer permitted to be used.

REPLY: For the majority of apartment blocks there are adequate facilities in place for
storage of refuse bins and arrangements for the bin collection service is
normally the responsibility of the management company for the particular
apartment block. However, it is difficult to comment on an individual
apartment block without precise details of same.

Permits for the collection and disposal of waste are issued by the National
Waste Collection Permit Office, Tullamore. The conditions of the waste
collection permits require that waste is segregated and is presented for
collection in wheeled bins. Accordingly, green bags are no longer being
issued by refuse collectors.

Councillor Sheahan indicated that he was unhappy with the response.

5. Question submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

| will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council intends to accept
landowner Con Duggan’'s offer of a strip of land at St. Senan's Terrace, Croom, to
facilitate the completion of footpaths.

REPLY: Engineering staff from the Travel and Transportation Department will meet
with Mr. Duggan to assess the suitability of this strip of land for footpath
construction.

It was proposed by Councillor O'Donoghue and seconded by Councillor Sheahan that this
matter be placed on the Agenda for the next Meeting.

6. Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

/ will ask at the next meeting, as a result of receiving numerous complaints about
the condition of the footpath/pathway from Kildimo Village to Kildimo National
School and the overgrown shrubbery along the pathway, what are Limerick City and
County Council's plans to improve the condition of this pathway which currently
consists of loose chippings, is uneven to walk on and lodges water in excessive

rain.

REPLY: The Area Office is proposing to include the reconstruction of this footpath
under the 2015 Development Fund Programme.

In relation to the water ponding issue, the existing drainage gully was
blocked and has now been cleared.

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

! will move at the next Meeting, in the interest of health and safety, that traffic
calming measures be introduced at Church Road, Croom, and at Towerfield, Croom.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O'Donoghue and seconded by Councillor O'Brien.
REPLY: Provision has been made in the 2014 Development Fund to install speed

cushions at Church Road, Croom. These works will be completed before the
end of this year.

The Travel & Transportation Department will assess the need for Traffic
Calming measures at Towerfield.

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors T, Neville and E. O’Brien

We will move at the next Meeting that any Public Representative who makes a
representation in the course of his or her office as a Councillor of the Adare-
Rathkeale Municipal District, on behalf of a constituent who has applied for a
Housing allocation, be formally notified, together with the Applicant, upon the
allocation of a local authority house in the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District to that

Applicant.

Councillor O'Brien in proposing the Motion stated that Housing was a massive issue and
indicated that, as Public Representatives, they were acting as an Agent for the

Constituent.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Neville

REPLY:

Guidance from the Data Protection Commissioner recognises that it is a
normal and accepted function of an Irish public representative to represent
individual constituents in their dealings with public and private organisations.
As a result the Office advises that, where a public representative makes a
written representation on behalf of a constituent, the Council can generally
assume that the constituent has given consent for the release of personal
data necessary to respond to the representation.

As a result if a Councillor has made a written representation in regard to an
applicant for housing and that applicant is allocated a house, it would appear
that advising the Councillor who made the representation of the outcome
would be in keeping with the Data Protection Act.

However, a Notice of Motion in regard to the issuing of data regarding
allocations has also been submitted in the Municipal District of Newcastle
West. What was being requested in that instance was contrary to Data
Protection legislation. However, it was indicated that we are anxious to work
with the Members to agree a practice that remains within the law while
meeting the needs of applicants and Councillors. As this issue affects all of
the Districts, it was recommended and accepted by the District that a small
working group be formed through the Party Leaders consisting of Councillors
and Officials with a view to making a future recommendation to Council in
this matter.

| recommend therefore that a decision on this Notice of Motion be deferred
pending a Council agreed strategy.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

! will move at the next Meeting, in the interest of health and safety, that traffic
calming measures be introduced in strategic locations, in consultation with the
Gardai, at Rathkeale.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O'Donoghue and seconded by Councillor Neville.

REPLY: An Garda Siochana has requested the Council to install speed reduction
measures at various locations in Rathkeale. The locations are currently
being surveyed to determine their suitability for such measures. It should be
noted that the implementation of such measures will require significant
funding and thus it is envisaged that installation would be carried out on a
phased basis.

It was indicated by some Members that residents in the Croom / Banogue area were
experiencing water shortages due to problems with the supply network. Some Members
also raised the issue of house fires in Cois Sruthain, Croom, where four houses went on
fire. Members felt that the poor water supply may have hindered the fire services in
tackling the fire. Members expressed concern that the rubble, caused as a result of the
fire, had not been removed. Queries were also raised from Members over fire safety
issues of other houses in the estate given the fact that the fire had spread to four houses.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, informed Members of Public Consultation Day,
organised by Office of Public Works, on Shannon CFRAM Study, on the risk of flooding in
the Castleconnell/Montpelier Area to be held on 19" November, 2014 in Castle Oaks
House Hotel, Castleconnell. The public was invited to view and comment on draft flood
maps for these areas. As Members were unable to attend the scheduled Public
Consultation for Rathkeale, Askeaton and Croom areas they could attend the Public
Consultation Day in Castle Oaks House Hotel where the draft flood maps for these areas
were also available. He also informed the Members that local input and knowledge was
being sought to ensure that the flood maps were accurate.

It was agreed that the next Meeting would be held on Tuesday, 2" December, 2014, at
9.00 a.m.

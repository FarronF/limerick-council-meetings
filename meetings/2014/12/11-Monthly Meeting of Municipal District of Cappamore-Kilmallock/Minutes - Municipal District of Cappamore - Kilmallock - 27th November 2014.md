progressive approach to the reduction of crime in rural communities and was

intended to improve the quality of life for all living in rural areas, particularly the

elderly. The Inspector outlined that the Programme worked on the principle of

shared responsibility for crime prevention and reduction between the Community and

An Garda Síochana. Members also welcomed Garda Clinics which were held once

weekly for the public in various towns and villages throughout the district.

Members outlined their concerns, which included the following:

 Only one Guard and one Sergeant stationed in Cappamore (the second

Guard out on long-term sick leave).

 Vehicles doing excessive speed through the Village of Ardpatrick – discussion

took place requesting that speed limits be reduced through towns and

villages.

 Drug use in the District and increased incidents of drug-driving.

Limerick City and County Council can confirm that works have

commenced in relation to the repairs to the bridge at the Limerick/

Tipperary border at Gortnagera. The current works involve the

construction of an access to both sides of the bridge, the removal of

light and heavy vegetation, propping of the masonry arch and erection

of scaffolding. The Consulting Engineers 'Punch Consulting Ltd' are

currently monitoring progress with the view to completing the design for

the rebuilding of the bridge. By week ending 28th November the

sections of the Spandrail wall and retaining walls at either side of the

of the road, placement of road surfacing and parapet walls should

occur during early to mid January 2015.

The 2014 Development Fund Allocation provided a sum of €25,000 to

NOTICES OF MOTION

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor W. O’ Donnell

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City & County Council install***

***appropriate speed ramps at Hillview Terrace, Caherconlish, in the interest of***

***road safety.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donnell stated that it was imperative that

appropriate speed ramps be installed at Hillview Terrace, Caherconlish, in the

interest of road safety. He stated that he was not happy with the Council’s reply and

that this matter should be dealt with on an individual basis.

Councillor Teefy seconded the Motion.

REPLY:

This motion should be considered in the context of Circular RSD

01/2014 issued recently by DTTAS. The circular asks local Authorities

to undertake a review process of speed limits in housing estates. In

effect the circular is suggesting the use of 30 kph Speed Limits in

Housing Estates with signage to be accompanied by the yellow

warning sign "Children At Play". If such an approach were adopted in

Limerick City and County Council it should be monitored and reviewed,

and only those estates where it was shown that the speed limit was not

being adhered to would be considered for the introduction of further

traffic calming measures, including ramps.

It is proposed to undertake such a review in the coming months in

conjunction with a general review of speed limits.---

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

***I will move at the next Meeting that the ramp by the new library in Cappamore***

***be removed completely and a pedestrian crossing with flashing lights be fitted***

***instead and a lowering in the footpaths for safe wheelchair access.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehy stated that the existing ramp at the new

Library in Cappamore needed to be removed as it was not wheelchair friendly.

Councillor Mitchell seconded the Motion.

REPLY:

This ramp has been in place since April last and I believe that it has

been welcomed by the vast majority of the people of Cappamore. It

performs traffic calming thereby allowing pedestrians to cross safely to

the new Library building in the knowledge that traffic speeds are

reduced significantly.

The placement of a pedestrian crossing with flashing lights would cost

approximately €15,000-€20,000 and this funding is not currently

available. Furthermore there is a requirement for traffic calming at this

location in the form of a ramp as Limerick City and County Council

placed a footpath linking the library with the Day Care Centre.

This ramp serves an important function especially for vulnerable road

users.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Donegan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City & County Council consider***

***the provision of a Pedestrian Crossing at Bruree National School.***

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that this issue was discussed in 2013 and it

was suggested that speed limits may have to be moved as they were required at the

school gate. Members queried if the school could provide some funding towards the

works.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Donegan outlined the urgent need for a

pedestrian crossing at Bruree National School.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor O’Donnell queried if the Council could move onto

design stage. The Senior Executive Engineer stated that he would liaise with the

Senior Executive Engineer, Main Roads, on the matter.---
7

REPLY:

An extension of the speed limit is required as the existing speed limit

zone is adjacent to the existing school. The extension of the present

speed limit should be submitted for consideration in the next speed

limit review.

A signal controlled crossing is required on this busy Regional Road

R518. The cost of a signalised crossing is approximately €20,000.

This could be considered as part of 2015 Development Fund

allocations.

It was stated by the Director, Water Services & Environment, that the relevant staff

member would attend the next Meeting to provide further information on Notices of

Motion Nos. 12 and 13.

There was a discussion on the bridge at Garrienderk which had been substantially

damaged. Members outlined the urgency in carrying out reconstruction works to the

bridge as it posed a safety hazard for motorists. The Operations Manager stated

that the bridge was in the ownership of Iarnród Éireann but it was the responsibility

of the Council to carry out the necessary repairs. The Executive Engineer stated

that he had been involved in the Traffic Management Plan which involved having

one-way traffic only and the use of traffic lights at each end. The Operations

Manager outlined that the design stage had gone out to tender and that a Consultant

would be appointed shortly. Members were informed that costings would be

available within a few weeks and it was estimated that it would take approximately

12 months to complete the works.

It was agreed that the next Meeting would be held on Thursday, 11th December,

2014 at 10.00 a.m. in Community Centre, Cappamore.

This concluded the Meeting.

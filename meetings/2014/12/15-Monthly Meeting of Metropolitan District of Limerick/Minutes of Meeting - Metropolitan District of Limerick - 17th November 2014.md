3.

Home and Social Development

(a)

Limerick Regeneration

Mr. Seamus Hanrahan, Project Manager, Office of Regeneration presented a progress

update on the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) which

included the following :

•

The range of organisations involved in the collaborative multi agency approach

being adopted.

•

The objectives of the social framework plan, an update on the social intervention

fund and a review of the community outreach structures.

•

The objectives of the economic framework plan including an overview of the

national and local context of the economic pillar and an update on the social

procurement policy.

•

The objectives of the Physical Framework Plan, an update on the extent of new

build and refurbishment work carried out and a status report on key sites under the

plan.

Members commended the presentation and welcomed the works already carried out in the

regeneration areas. They stressed the importance of providing local employment and the

need to deal quickly with voids in view of the ongoing need for social housing. They

highlighted the need to continue to work to win the confidence of the local communities

and the need for social as well as economic investment in the regeneration areas. It was

noted that more houses were being demolished than built in these areas but a view was

also expressed that communities see this as a positive development as it creates more

open spaces.
---
Discussion took place in relation to the needs of some locations adjacent to the

regeneration areas and in particular the left hand side of Hyde Road, including the area

around the shops, and it was suggested that the Minister be requested to include the left

hand side of Hyde Road in the regeneration area. There was also a suggestion that the

Minister for Justice and Equality be requested to restore the Garda numbers to the

necessary levels. Concern was expressed that charges were being imposed for access to

community facilities by groups that are funded by the Council and that this be investigated

further. It was suggested that the Local Enterprise Development Partnership engage

positively with the College of Further Education on their need to expand their facilities and

explore the provision of shared facilities.

The Mayor took his seat at this point in the meeting.

In response to queries raised by Members, Mr. S. Hanrahan, Project Manager, Office of

Regeneration clarified the following points:

•

In relation to the provision of local employment, of the five contractors working in

the Weston area, four were from Limerick and the final contractor, though based in

Tipperary, employed mainly Limerick workers.

•

The extent of refurbishment required to some vacated houses created delays

before reletting.

•

The target population levels for the regeneration areas was the 2013 level. It was

hoped to encourage a mix of public and private housing and anticipated that

population will increase within the regeneration areas.

•

Social grant allocations were targeted at regeneration specific projects.

•

In relation to boarded up, privately owned dwellings, the Council used derelict site

and dangerous structure legislation as appropriate to resolve. Derelict Site cases

can take up to six months to progress. Compulsory Purchase Orders were seen as

a last resort.

•

The Council had regular contact with the Gardai as law and order issues occur.

•

In relation to apartments, there was a preference for own front door units and less

shared space.

•

With regard to the suggestion that a number of community stables be provided,

Dunsink in Dublin was being looked at as a possible model for dealing with the

issue of horses.

•

The Wallers Well 10 house turnkey development was being funded by regeneration

and tenants will come from regeneration and not the general housing list.

•

The redevelopment of the Fireplace Site in Kings Island was under review and will

have regard to the heritage value of the property.

(b)

Hyde Road Refurbishment

Circulated Report of the Director of Home and Social Development dated 5th November,

2014.

The Director of Home and Social Development informed the meeting that it was proposed

to refurbish the flats at Hyde Road to provide 20 apartments. The proposal would require

the Council to dispose of its interest in the existing units, with constraints, to Clúid who

would provide the funding for the project. It was anticipated that the works would be

completed by July 2016 and the Council would retain 100% nomination rights for 30 years.

Members broadly welcomed the development which would address a key site adjacent to

Colbert Station. The following points were raised in relation to the proposed development:

•

that it marked an ongoing shift in Government Policy towards providing funding for

Voluntary Housing Associations and away from funding Local Authority Housing

Programmes.

•

that the refurbishment cost per unit seemed high and if the development did not

include for items such as the replacement of the existing wooden floors with

concrete, it did not represent value for money.

•

that it was not clear what would happen after 30 years when the Council no longer

had nomination rights or in the event of Clúid going bankrupt.

•

that the tenants would never get an opportunity to purchase these units, an option

usually open to other Local Authority tenants.

•

that the proposed development represented multi-occupancy of single buildings

contrary to principles established for adjacent regeneration areas.

In reply to queries raised by Members, the Director of Home and Social Development

clarified the following points :-

•

Rents will be calculated in accordance with the Council's differential rent scheme.

•

It was intended that these units would be allocated from the general housing list.

•

The development was not part of regeneration nor was it intended exclusively for

over 50's.

•

Limerick City and County Council will have 100% nomination rights for the duration

of the availability agreements.

•

Any undertakings given to previous tenants in relation to their return to this location

will be honoured.

•

The considerable cost of demolition should be borne in mind when comparing the

unit cost of redevelopment with the potential unit cost of rebuilding.

•

The extent of tenure required by Clúid arose from their need to borrow to part fund
---
the development and there will not be a one year review of the contract.

4.

Travel and Transportation

Kings Island Flood Protection Project

Circulated the Report of the Director, Travel and Transportation dated 11th November,

2014.

Members highlighted the importance of the proposed stakeholders advisory group in terms

of the ability of the project to attract funding. The need for community involvement was

stressed and it was noted that there were people with considerable local knowledge that

could be of benefit.

Following discussion it was agreed that the Mayor, Councillor Michael Sheahan would be

an ex-officio member of the stakeholders advisory group and that each of the Councillors

in the Limerick City North Electoral Area would be members of the group, namely

Councillors Crowley, Daly, Gilligan, Hourigan, Prendiville and Quinlivan.

5.

Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will ask at the next meeting if there is a drainage issue in the Main Drainage***

***system in certain sections of Monaleen Heights estate that would require an area-***

***wide fix?***

**REPLY** :

The Council is satisfied that there are no issues relating to the drainage

network in Monaleen Heights. There may be occasional blockages which are

cleared as necessary but this is not unusual in many estates around the city

environs and rural towns. It should be noted that the foul sewers are now the

responsibility of Irish Water.

Irish Water or the Council, as appropriate, can investigate any specific or

localised areas that are causing difficulties. The findings of any such

investigations will inform any long term solution that may be required, subject

to the necessary funding being available.

6.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council allocate the***

***necessary funding to provide suitable traffic calming measures (ramps) and***

***appropriate signage (caution children playing signs) within the Inis Mor / Lua***

***housing estate so as to reduce the speed of cars driving in an estate where there***

***are many families with young children living.***

This motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

It was agreed that the reply, as set out below, would be made available to members.

**REPLY**:

This motion should be considered in the context of Circular RSD 01/2014

issued recently by the DTTAS. The Circular asks Local Authorities to

undertake a review process of speed limits in housing estates. In effect, the
---
Circular is suggesting the use of 30kph Speed Limits in Housing Estates with

signage to be accompanied by the yellow warning sign "Children at Play". If

such an approach were adopted in Limerick City and County it should be

monitored and reviewed, and only those estates where it was shown that the

speed limit was not being adhered to would be considered for the

introduction of further traffic calming measures, including ramps.

Limerick City and County Council has replied to the Department of Tourism,

Transport & Sport indicating its intention to undertake such a review in

conjunction with a general review of speed limits. New Guidance Documents

on Review of Speed Limits are expected to be issued by the DTTAS in the

coming months and the review would then commence immediately, to be

completed before the end of 2015.

7.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick City and***

***County Council calls on the Government to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts, to***

***ensure that monies and assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau be set aside***

***for local communities. In Limerick these monies would be ring-fenced to enable***

***them to work to build better communities by providing community facilities and***

***providing funding to groups dealing with drug addictions such as the Mid-West***

***Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum (formerly Task Force).***

This motion was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Quinlivan highlighted the issue of drug misuse and

addiction in the city and the benefits that would accrue if funding, arising from the seizure

of monies and assets by the Criminal Assets Bureau, could be made available to the Mid

West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum.

A number of Members expressed dissatisfaction with the motion on the grounds that it

gave a bad impression of Limerick, was impractical in that assets seized by CAB are done

so at a national rather than a local level and that there are many organisations equally in

need of funding. It was also pointed out that, in some cases, the costs incurred by CAB in

taking a case exceeded the value of the assets seized.

It was proposed by Councillor O'Hanlon and seconded by Councillor Leddin that the

motion be amended as follows :

***That the Metropolitan District of Limerick City and County Council calls on the***

***Government to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts to ensure that monies and assets***

***seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau be set aside for the enhancement of the***

***Criminal Assets Bureau to facilitate it to expand the scale of its works.***

A vote was taken on the proposed amendment to the original motion. The result of the

voting was as follows :-

**For the Amendment:**

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Collins, Daly, Hourigan, Hurley, Leddin, Lynch, O'Dea, O'Hanlon,

Secas and Sheahan.
---
**Against the Amendment:**

Councillors Keller, Loftus, McCreesh, Ó Ceallaigh, Prendiville and Quinlivan.

The Mayor declared the amendment carried and therefore the original motion defeated.

8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, in***

***consultation with Southside Regeneration and local soccer clubs, prepare a master***

***plan for the upgrade and redevelopment of Caledonian Park.***

The Deputy Chief Executive noted that this had been an issue for some time and gave an

undertaking that the appropriate agencies would be brought together to establish if a

solution could be agreed.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Michael Hourigan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the lights on the Shannon Bridge be replaced as***

***at present up to 60% are not working.***

This motion was proposed by Councillor Hourigan and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

The Deputy Chief Executive informed the meeting that these lights were ordered and

would be in place in a number of days.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will move at the next Meeting that funding is provided for a set of traffic lights to***

***control the pedestrian crossing on College Road in front of Castletroy College and***

***for putting in place traffic measures, such as traffic lights or pedestrian crossing at***

***the Monaleen Road - College Road junction in Castletroy.***

This motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Daly.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas pointed out the traffic issues each school

morning at Castletroy College where students believe they have the right of way to cross

the road and traffic build up provides issues for emergency services.

In supporting the motion, Councillor O'Hanlon requested that a forum be put in place

where such issues could be discussed at area level. The Senior Engineer, Travel and

Transportation indicated that he would meet with Councillors to discuss any such issues.

**REPLY**:

**Pedestrian Controlled Signals at Castletroy College**:

It is considered that the Zebra Crossing lights combined with the raised

pedestrian crossing ramp that are in place at this location are the most

suitable arrangement here. The use of pedestrian controlled signals in

locations such as this is not recommended by the NRA from a pedestrian

safety point of view. Generally speaking, it is considered that a zebra control

is preferable because it requires an interaction between the pedestrian and

the motorist that ensures the pedestrian does not step off the kerb until it is
---
safe to do so. With a signal control, some pedestrians assume that the

appearance of the green man display gives them an assured safe crossing

opportunity and they will step out onto the carriageway without thinking of

staying alert for approaching vehicles.

In addition, the capacity of the road is unduly reduced with a signal controlled

crossing as the duration of red time for vehicles has a minimum set to cater

for the occasional slow pedestrian. This is much longer than the average

time it takes most people to cross and results in undue delay every time the

button is pressed. With zebra control the vehicle driver is free to move on as

soon as the pedestrian has finished crossing.

It should be noted that during congested periods pedestrians may attempt to

cross at pedestrian controlled signals even if the signal is red for pedestrians.

It should also be noted that it is the intention of the Travel and Transportation

Department under Limerick Smarter Travel to introduce table tops through

the junctions on Castletroy College Road in 2015. This will further improve

safety at this location and over the length of the road. This will also

encourage sustainable transport modes, walking and cycling.

**Traffic Signals at Monaleen Road - College Road Junction in Castletroy:**

It is assumed the junction referred to here is the Kilmurray Link Road /

Castletroy College Road Junction. It is the intention of the Travel and

Transportation Department under Limerick Smarter Travel to introduce a

table top through this junction in 2015 thereby reducing traffic speeds and

improving road safety for the more vulnerable road users (pedestrians and

cyclists). It is unlikely that there is a warrant for a signalled controlled

junction. The junction will however continue to be monitored.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Marian Hurley

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately***

***introduce parking bye laws in Annacotty Village.***

This motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Hurley informed the meeting that each day up to 20

cars were being left parked in Annacotty by people taking the bus to Dublin, thereby

preventing normal access to the local shops.

In supporting the motion, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that people were now avoiding

Annacotty because of this issue and that this prolonged parking was spreading to the

adjacent estates.

**REPLY**:

The current paid parking Bye Laws for Limerick City and County made under

Section 36 of the Roads Traffic Act 1994 will require to be amended in order

to include for Annacotty Village. This is a matter that will have to be brought

before the Transportation and Infrastructure SPC when it is established in

2015.
---
To allow for enforcement of the Bye Laws an additional Traffic Warden, based

in the suburbs, may be required and provision for this will have to be

provided for in the Budget.

This concluded the Meeting.

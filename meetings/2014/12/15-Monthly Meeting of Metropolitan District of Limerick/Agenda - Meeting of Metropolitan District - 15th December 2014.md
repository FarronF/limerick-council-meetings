regulate the times and or locations that waste collection companies can start

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

| will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District that Limerick City and

County Council will, in the interest of the safety of pedestrians, look at extending the
barrier along the 40 metre section of the river-front from the Skateboard Park back

towards the Clarion Hotel where there is no barrier in place to prevent falls into the

river and that the Council repaint to white the black bollards and chains, adjacent to
the slipway at Howley's Quay, to make them more visible at night and provide more

safety for any person in their vicinity.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick City & County Council provide an
updated report on all those properties / lands currently listed on the derelict sites
register within the metropolitan area and what progress is being made with owners
to redevelop these sites.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

| will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that funding
be made available to ensure Novas Initiatives can continue the Cold Weather
Service in Limerick city they provided in previous years. This emergency service
ensures that, on particularly cold nights, an extra staff member is brought in so they
can allow people to sleep overnight in their reception area.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller

| will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we

register our support for the recent secondary school teachers' strike and write to the
Minister for Education calling on her to scrap plans to introduce school-based

assessment that would put enormous strains on the relations between teachers,

pupils and parents.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

| will move at the next Metropolitan District meeting that, in future, as a matter of
extreme urgency, temporary night shelter be provided in Limerick City to cope with
the overflow of homelessness between the months of October and March.

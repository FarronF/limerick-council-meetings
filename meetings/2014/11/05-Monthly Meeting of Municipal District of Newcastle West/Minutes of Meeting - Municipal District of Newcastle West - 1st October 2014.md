Abbeyfeale Fire Station

The Director of Community, Leisure and Emergency Services outlined that the Fire Station,
Abbeyfeale, had closed at 5.00 p.m. on Friday, 26" September, 2014, due to a number of
staff being unavailable for work due to illness. It was stated that, as health and safety
requirements dictated that a minimum complement of six staff must be present to maintain
operations, a decision was taken to temporarily close the Fire Station for a period of
approximately three weeks. The Chief Fire Officer stated that all incidents normally
responded to by the Abbeyfeale Fire Brigade would be dealt with by brigades in Listowel,
Newcastle West and Castleisland Fire Stations. He stated that the situation would be
reviewed on a daily basis but he did not believe that response times would be too badly
affected. He also stated that discussions were ongoing with Human Resources and SIPTU
to try to resolve the matter.

The Members voiced grave concerns about the closure of the Fire Station, particularly as
the town of Abbeyfeale was one of the biggest employers in West Limerick. They were
concerned that the emergency response time would be increased by a minimum of 15
minutes. Members also enquired if fire-fighters could be redeployed from other stations or
if personnel driving Council trucks could drive the fire engines. Councillor Galvin called for
a full Council Meeting if steps were not put in place to re-open the Fire Station. The
Members also queried if the vacancy was going to be filled after the retirement of a fire-
fighter a number of weeks previously. Members were informed that the positions of
Retained Fire-Fighters, Abbeyfeale, were being advertised and that the closing date was
23° October, 2014.

It was decided that a further briefing session would be held on Thursday, 9" October,
2014, at 10.00 a.m. in the Fire Station, Abbeyfeale.

3. Corporate Services:

QUESTIONS

5. uestion submitted by Councillor vin

/ will ask at the next Meeting what is the hold up with the purchase of Ahern’s Old
Butcher Stall, Abbeyfeale.

REPLY: In-depth discussions concerning traffic management issues on Main Street,
Abbeyfeale, involving members of the local business community, the Council
and the National Roads Authority (NRA) have taken place over the course of

2013/2014.

To date, an agreed approach has not been reached, resulting in the NRA
withdrawing the 2014 allocated funding. It is anticipated that efforts will
continue between the concerned parties to reach an agreed resolution.

The acquisition of the Butcher Stall to facilitate a walkway is a key component of
these discussions, the purchase of which will proceed only if it forms part of an
integrated traffic/pedestrian movement plan for Main Street.

6. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting what is the current status with regard to the installation
of a public toilet in Abbeyfeale.

REPLY: Capital funding is not currently provided for the provision of a public toilet in
Abbeyfeale. An application for such funding can be included in proposals for
the Development Fund in 2015/2016. If such funding is committed, a site
would need to be identified, design prepared, and Part 8 planning procedure
followed. Consideration would also need to be given to a maintenance
regime for such facility.

7. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting if safety railings can be provided between the set-down
area fronting An Gael Scoil along Station Road, Newcastle West, and the R522.

REPLY: Maintenance funds are extremely limited in the current year, especially for
new works of this nature. The funding position can be reviewed towards
year end, and the works considered if funding is available.

8. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting if road lining can be renewed or put in place at a
number of junctions leading from a number of housing estates towards their main

thoroughfare.

REPLY: Maintenance funds are extremely limited in the current year, resulting in
works such as renewal of road markings, as sought, having to be addressed
on a priority basis. The junctions will be examined in this context.

9. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

/ will ask at the next Meeting if the public footpath can be extended eastward from
an Gael Scoil towards the GST on the town side.

REPLY: The Gael Scoil, through its own resources, will carry out the footpath works
themselves.

10. Question submitted by Councillor F. Foley

/ will ask at the next Meeting if a parking bay can be placed in front of Liston’s
grocery shop at Maiden Street, Newcastle West.

REPLY: It is not possible to put an additional parking bay in front of Liston’s shop in
Maiden Street due to the fact that the shop is located in the middle of a
junction and there are double yellow lines in place.

11. Question submitted by Councillor S. Browne

! will ask at the next Meeting if the trees in front of the water treatment plant will be
cut this Autumn as they are now extremely high and may cause damage in Winter

storms.

REPLY: As previously stated, Irish Water has no proposals to carry out any
maintenance works on the above mentioned trees. They do not pose any
danger at present. It should be noted that they survived Storm Darwin on

12" February, 2014.

NOTICES OF MOTION

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

/ will move at the next Meeting that the Council undertakes hedge cutting within the
speed limit areas of our towns and villages.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that hedge cutting was required as a
matter of urgency within the speed limit areas of towns and villages.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that a data base of property owners
be compiled.

Members supported the Motion.

REPLY: Hedge cutting is legally the responsibility of the landowner and, while the
Council does cut hedges at junctions from time to time from a safety point of
view, resources do not permit all hedges within speed limit areas to be cut by

the Council.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Foley

! will move at the next Meeting that the Council links up the crash barrier on the new
section of road at Barnagh.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Foley stressed the importance of linking up the crash
barrier on the new section of road at Barnagh.

Councillor Browne seconded the Motion.

REPLY: The Safety Barriers on the new N21 Killarney Pole to Barnagh Road Safety
Scheme (Phase 1) have been designed and located in accordance with
current National Roads Authority Design Standards. Also, the Scheme as a
whole was subject to Road Safety Audits at various stages in the Scheme’s
development and any recommendations in respect of the Safety Barriers
were incorporated.

Accordingly, any extension to the Safety Barriers on this Scheme is not
deemed necessary in the context of the previous process and consequently
any funding required to undertake such work would not be sanctioned by the
National Roads Authority.

The Council will keep the matter under review during construction of the next
phase of the Scheme which is expected to commence in November of this

year.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council improves the signage and bus stop
in front of Desmond Castle.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Browne informed Members that he had met with the
Office of Public Works (O.P.W.) and the Chamber of Commerce and discussed improved
access for tour buses for Desmond Castle. He stated that there were a few infrastructural
issues, for example, inadequate signage and unsuitable bay.

Councillor Scanlan seconded the Motion.

REPLY: Signage at the bus stop is the responsibility of Bus Eireann and signage for
Desmond Castle is the responsibility of the O.P.W.

15. Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

! will move at the next Meeting that the Council increases the allocation and
selection of books to Newcastle West District Libraries.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Browne requested that an increased selection of books
be made available at the Libraries in the area. He also felt that the selection of C.D.s

should be up-dated.
Councillor Galvin seconded the Motion.

REPLY: Library records show that in 2014, The Council has, to date, purchased
5,333 new books for County Limerick Library Service. Newcastle West has
received approximately 1,000 new books, which represents 18% of all new
stock purchased.

Records also show that Newcastle West, in terms of number of registered
readers and recorded number of books issued, accounts for 16% of overall
county-wide business.

Therefore, pro-rota, Newcastle West Library received more new books in
2014 than any of the other 14 libraries in the county.

In addition, all Branch Libraries in the City and County Library Service can
request books from other Branch Libraries in the Service and this has proven
to be very successful since the merger of Limerick City and County Library
Service. Newcastle West Library regularly receives books from other Branch
Libraries in the City and County.

There is no doubt that a reduction in the overall level of book purchases has
occurred since the economic downturn of 2008. The Library Service has,
with all other Council Departments, had to experience reduced budgets. This
has inevitably impacted on the Council’s capacity to purchase new books.

However, the Council's records would indicate that Newcastle West Library
has not been disproportionately impacted upon, relative to other Branches in
the City and County Library Service.

Members queried as to how soon the necessary measures would be put in place to ensure
customer confidentiality when presenting at the public counter. They were informed that
Margaret McEvoy, Executive Architect, was finalising the design and that she would give a
presentation on Customer Service Improvements at the next Meeting.

It was agreed that the next Meeting would be held on Wednesday, 5" November, 2014, at
10.00 a.m.

This concluded the Meeting.

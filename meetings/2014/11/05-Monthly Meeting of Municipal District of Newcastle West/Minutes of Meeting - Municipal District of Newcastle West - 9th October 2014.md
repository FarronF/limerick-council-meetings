would be a follow-up in relation to District Plans broken down into separate

areas.

* A Municipal District Schedule in relation to Road Grant Allocations would be

drawn up in the New Year.

* Regarding the allocation, he confirmed that it was not additional money but

rather a new focus on how the existing budget was allocated.

* Regarding special projects, the Head of Finance outlined that these should be
of a specific and strategic nature and specified a minimum spend of €50,000
per project. It was noted that the total amount allocated for special projects in
each of the Municipal Districts was €100,000 with €150,000 being provided for

the Metropolitan District.

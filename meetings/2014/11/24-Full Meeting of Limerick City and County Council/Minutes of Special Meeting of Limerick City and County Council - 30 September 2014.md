Local Community Development Committee:

At the outset and with the Cathaoirleach’s permission, the Meetings

Administrator referred to the appointment of 4 Members to the Local Community

Development (LCDC) at Special Meeting of the Council held on 7th July. He stated

that, as he had advised at the September Meeting, the Grouping system should have

applied to the nomination of Members in this case and accordingly the membership

to the LCDC needed to be reviewed.

It was now proposed to apply the Grouping system and a Group of 10

Members was required in this case, if so desired.

The following grouping was nominated:

**For Councillor Browne**

Councillors Browne, McCreesh, McMahon, Cmhlr Ó Ceallaigh, Quinlivan, Sheehy,

Keller, Loftus, Prendiville, Gilligan.  **(10)**---

The Cathaoirleach declared Councillor Browne appointed to the Local

Community Development Committee.

The Cathaoirleach stated that, as Members were aware, the Special Meeting

was being held to deal with Item 3(e) on the Agenda for the September Council

Meeting of 22nd September, 2014, i.e. Local Property Tax, and also the remaining

items on the Agenda for the September Meeting which had not been dealt with.

3(e) Local Property Tax

Circulated, (i) Report from the Head of Finance dated 17th September, 2014,

and (ii) Variation of Base Rate of Local Property Tax 2015 - Report on Public

Submissions dated 17th September, 2014.

The Cathaoirleach stated that a decision on the Local Property Tax was

required by 4.30pm that afternoon in order to submit the Council’s decision to the

Revenue Commissioners by their deadline of 5.30pm.

The Cathaoirleach added that, as already agreed at Meeting of 22nd

September, Notices of Motion Nos. 16 and 19A as follows would be taken in

conjunction with this item:

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors M. Quinlivan, S.

Browne, Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh, Councillors L.M. Sheehy, C.

McMahon and M. McCreesh

***We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council use its***

***powers under current legislation to reduce the Local Property Tax by 15%.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan and seconded by Cmhlr Ó

Ceallaigh.

Councillor Quinlivan, in proposing the Motion, stated that the Sinn Féin

Councillors had consulted with the public on this issue and in this regard had

submitted, to the Council, 660 submissions from members of the public looking for a

15% reduction. He stated that their Motion honoured the commitment made during

the recent Local and European Elections. He stated that the Sinn Féin Party was

opposed to the Local Property Tax for a number of reasons, which included the

following:

• The charge was a blanket levy and took no account of ability to pay.

• The Government had not taken into account mortgages, negative equity,

stamp duty paid or the forthcoming water charges.

• The tax would not be used to pay for local services.---
3

Councillor Quinlivan argued that a 10% improvement in the collection of rates

in the City would make up the €2.4 million shortfall which a 15% reduction entailed.

In support of the reduction in LPT, he made reference to the high level of outstanding

Development Levies which could be collected and also the funding that seemed to

be available to purchase strategic sites in the City.

In conclusion, Councillor Quinlivan reiterated that Sinn Féin was

fundamentally opposed to the tax and, in the immediate term, was proposing the

15% reduction in order to ease the tax burden on people. He added that the

reduction would also benefit the local economy as the money saved would be spent

in local shops and businesses.

Following some discussion, the Cathaoirleach directed that a vote be taken on

the Motion. The result of the voting was as follows:

**For the Motion**

Councillors Browne, Daly, Gilligan, Keller, Leddin, Loftus, McCreesh, McMahon,

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, Prendiville, Quinlivan, Secas, Sheehy.  **(13)**

**Against the Motion**

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Clifford, Collins (J), Collins (M), Donegan, Foley, Galvin,

Gleeson, Hourigan, Keary, Lynch, Mitchell, Neville, O’Brien, O’Dea, O’Donnell,

O’Donoghue, O’Hanlon, Ryan, Scanlan, Sheahan (J), Sheahan (K), Sheahan (M),

Teefy.  **(25)**

There were no abstentions

The Cathaoirleach declared the Motion defeated.

19A Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Members, that, in***

***accordance with Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act, 2012,***

***Limerick City and County Council formally resolve to vary the basic rate of***

***Local Property Tax in respect of residential properties situated in Limerick City***

***and County Council’s administrative area. We propose a local adjustment***

***factor (LAF) of -15% for the year 2015.***

Councillor Collins (M) explained that he had tabled this Motion back in August

for the September Meeting. Since that time, he advised, he had undertaken some

research into how local authorities were reducing property taxes nationally. He said

that some local authorities were proposing to fund the reductions out of surplus

funds. Based on this information, he indicated that he was now not proposing to

reduce the LPT by 15%. In order to protect services and benefit the community, he

proposed an amendment to the original Motion and proposed a reduction of 15%

over 5 years at a rate of 3% per annum to be reviewed annually.---
4

The Chief Executive advised that, in its current state, the amended Motion

was legally out of order in that the proposal could relate only to a variation of the rate

for 2015.

Accordingly, Councillor Collins (M) stated that he wished to further amend his

Motion to read as follows and this was seconded by Councillor Clifford:

***“I will move at the next Meeting, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Members,***

***that, in accordance with Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax)***

***Act, 2012, Limerick City and County Council formally resolve to vary the***

***basic rate of Local Property Tax in respect of residential properties***

***situated in Limerick City and County Council’s administrative area. We***

***propose a local adjustment factor (LAF) of -3% for the year 2015.”***

Councillor Collins (M) also asked the Chief Executive to ring-fence €7.5

million, i.e. €1.5 million annually over the 5 years, and this to be made available as

part of the General Municipal Allocation. This money, he advised, would be

allocated to each of the Municipal Districts and Metropolitan District for Community

Projects to be agreed by the Members of each District.

Following some further discussion and as not all Members were in agreement

with the amended Motion as proposed by Councillor Collins (M) and seconded by

Councillor Clifford, the Cathaoirleach directed that a vote be taken. The result of the

voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillors Browne, Clifford, Collins (J), Collins (M), Daly, Donegan, Foley, Gilligan,

Gleeson, Keller, Leddin, Loftus, Lynch, McCreesh, McMahon, O’Brien, Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh, O’Dea, O’Donoghue, O’Hanlon, Prendiville, Quinlivan, Ryan, Secas,

Sheahan (K), Sheehy, Teefy. ***(27)***

**Against**

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Galvin, Hourigan, Keary, Mitchell, Neville, O’Donnell,

Scanlan, Sheahan (J), Sheahan (M).  **(11)**

There were no abstentions.

The Cathaoirleach declared the amended Motion, as proposed by Councillor

Collins (M) and seconded by Councillor Clifford, carried and it was agreed that the

following resolution be adopted by the same voting.

Proposed by Councillor Collins (M);

Seconded by Councillor Clifford;

And Resolved:---
5

“That, in accordance with Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act,

2012, as amended by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act, 2013,

Limerick City and County Council hereby determines that the basic rate of Local

Property Tax (LPT) should stand varied downwards by 3% for the period of one year

from the next Local Property Tax liability date in respect of relevant residential

properties situated in the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council.”

7

Development Act, 2013, the Planning Authority proposed **not** to commence the

(b)

Cemeteries Development Programme 2014-2015 - Raising of

Loan

Circulated, report of the Director, Environment and Water, dated 12th

September, 2014, seeking the Council’s approval to the raising of a loan of €300,000

towards A Cemeteries Development Programme 2014-2015, the details of which

were outlined in the report.---
8

The Cathaoirleach stated that he proposed taking his own Motion – Notice of

Motion No. 24 on the Agenda – in conjunction with this item as follows:

***“I will move at the next Meeting that the Council would introduce a***

***Programme which would provide water supplies to Burial Grounds***

***which do not already have a supply.”***

Councillor Sheahan (K) in proposing the Motion, asked if the Council would

consider installing a tap in burial grounds which did not currently have one to

facilitate those tending to graves and, in particular, referred to the elderly.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue.

**REPLY:**

There are approx. 240 burial grounds in Co. Limerick. Many of these

are maintained by local community groups who receive a small level of

funding towards the maintenance costs. There are circa 118 burial

ground committees in place, some of which look after a number of

burial grounds.

Each burial ground would need to be assessed separately for the

provision of a water supply. The costs involved would include piping

the water, hire of machinery, labour costs, material costs and possible

road crossing. In addition, access to some of the burial grounds would

be difficult as the access would not be in the ownership of the Council.

It would also be necessary to make an application to Irish Water for

each water connection. The estimated cost of each water connection

would be in the region of €500 to €1,000 but would vary depending on

the distance the water would need to be piped. In addition, there would

be ongoing maintenance costs and ongoing payments to Irish Water

for water supply.

The Council has a very limited budget for the maintenance and

upgrade of burial grounds and finance is not available for the provision

of public water taps as requested.

Proposed by Councillor Foley;

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J);

And Resolved:

“That, subject to the sanction of the Minister for the Environment, Community

and Local Government, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the

raising of a loan of €300,000 to finance the Cemeteries Development Programme

2014-2015.”---

Circulated, report of the Director, Community, Leisure & Emergency Services,

dated 9th September, 2014.

The report stated that it was proposed to purchase Unit 6E at the Docklands

Business Park, Limerick, as the new Limerick City and County Civil Defence

Headquarters and the approval of the Council was requested to the raising of a loan

of €310,000 for this purchase.

Proposed by Councillor Ryan;

Seconded by Councillor McCreesh;

And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act, 2001, the

approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the raising of a loan of €310,000

for the purchase of a new Civil Defence Headquarters.”

(b)

Circulated, report of the Director, Community, Leisure and Emergency

Services dated 15th September, 2014, enclosing schedule setting out the

the recommended grants under the Arts Act, 2003, as set out in the schedule to the

report of the Director of Community, Leisure and Emergency Services dated 15th

September, 2014.”

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions were circulated to all Members prior to the

Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

10.

Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh

***I will ask at the next Meeting can Limerick City and County Council explain the***

***complete lack of information and communication with the home owners who***

***were recently targeted with the unfair penalties sought under NPPR; how can***

***this tax be collected in so many different modes across the country with***

***discounts being offered by some Council areas but not in Limerick.***

**REPLY:**

The NPPR was introduced under the Local Government (Charges) Act,

2009, whereby properties that were not being lived in by the owner as

their main residence were subject to an annual charge of €200 with a

liability date of 31st July, 2009, and on subsequent dates of 31st March

for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, with penalties at the rate of €20 per

month, per year of late payment. The charge does not apply for 2014.

The NPPR was self-declaration and the onus was on the property

owner to notify the relevant local authority within their area.

Under the Act, it is a required function of a local authority to collect

NPPR charges, including late payment fees. All proceeds from the

charge are retained by local authorities and are used for the provision

of local services.

Throughout the period 2009 to 2014, there have been extensive media

campaigns, both nationally and locally, in order to promote compliance

as regards the NPPR. In more recent times, Limerick City and County

Council advertised regarding pending deadlines and this was done

through the media and also by publishing details on the Council

websites.---
11

Guidance issued by the Department of the Environment, Community

and Local Government under the Local Government Reform Act, 2014,

states that ‘*in every circumstance, local authorities should be satisfied*

*they have taken the most equitable, efficient and economically*

*beneficial course in the collection of the NPPR charge. In determining*

*a course of action, local authorities should have regard to factors*

*including ensuring equitable treatment of all NPPR owners; the cost of*

*collection; the owner’s circumstances and ability to pay; and the*

*benefit to the local authority of prompt and/or structured payment of the*

*charge.”*

Limerick City and County Council has had queries from people living

abroad since the introduction of the NPPR charges and the Council

has dealt with all its customers in a fair and equitable manner and will

continue to do so.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary

***I will ask the Chief Executive at the next Meeting if he can provide details in***

***tabular form by Local Authority estate of the unoccupied houses in each***

***estate, the maximum time in each case that houses have been left vacant and***

***the amount of lost revenue to Limerick City and County Council as a result of***

***maintaining these vacant properties.***

**REPLY:**

It is not possible in the short time provided to respond with the detail as

requested. Set out below is an overview of the stock situation within

Limerick City and County Council as at September, 2014.

Work is ongoing on the merger of the housing system and, as soon as

the system allows, it is intended to report regularly to the Council

through the Management Report as provided for under the Local

Government Reform Act, 2014. As part of the new organisation, the

manner in which the Council carries out maintenance of its stock and

its allocation process is under review to ensure that maintenance is

carried out in a timely manner (subject to budget) and allocations are

done as expeditiously as possible.

Houses are vacant for a number of reasons, e.g. awaiting pre-letting

repairs, major refurbishment and awaiting allocation. The allocation

process is delayed by Garda vetting and, in certain areas, a high level

of refusal of offers also causes delays.

Limerick City and County Council received a grant allocation in 2014 of

€968,150 in respect of addressing the longterm voids within its housing

stock (86 in no.). Work is ongoing on these voids.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary

***I will ask the Chief Executive at the next Meeting if he can provide details in***

***tabular form giving a full schedule of all items of plant and machinery in the***

***ownership of this Authority and the daily, weekly and monthly rates being***

***charged for their use at the various locations of operation throughout the City***

***and County.***

**REPLY:**

Machinery Hireage rates for 2014 were set early in the year following a

report prepared by the Executive Engineer in the Machinery Section.

The rates recommended took into account a number of factors

including: (i) analysis of previous income and expenditure accounts;

(ii) projected hireage for 2014; (iii) overheads; (iv) loan repayments for

the Machinery Yard; (v) replacement/purchase costs of machinery;

(vi) central management charges; (vii) modifications to plant; (viii)

compliance with Health and Safety requirements.

Taking all these into account, the following rates were recommended.

This was endorsed by the Senior Executive Engineer, Newcastle West,

recommended by the Senior Engineer, Transportation, and approved

by the Director of Services, Transportation. A Manager’s Order was

signed by the City and County Manager.

There has not been an increase in rates for 4 years.

***set to be carried out this year.***

**REPLY:**

18 Community Involvement Schemes were initially approved for

funding by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2014.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many qualified housing applicants await***

***tenancies with this Authority and what is the current breakdown for each of***

***the 4 administrative areas.***

**REPLY:**

There is a total of 4,203 approved applicants on the housing list of

Limerick City and County Council at 16th September, 2014. The

analysis outlined below is based on the first listed area of choice

recorded on the application form.

Applicants must choose a minimum of one area of choice but may

select up to a maximum of three areas of choice when completing their

housing application. The areas of choice are not afforded any ranking

on the system and an applicant must be considered for any vacancies

arising in each of the areas of choice selected.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will ask at the next Meeting where are there known lead water pipes still in***

***use, both in houses and estates built by the City and the County Councils, and***

***private houses approved by them.***

**REPLY:**

Public water supplies were traditionally delivered through cast iron

mains with lead pipe connections from the mains to properties. This

practice was phased out gradually from the 1950s onwards.

Accordingly, it is likely that properties connected to mains before this

time would have utilised lead services.

In this regard, Limerick City and County Council has replaced almost

2,000 of these lead services in the last number of years in areas such

as Janesboro, Pennywell, Garryowen, Kilalee, Hyde Road, Prospect,

Upper and Lower Carey’s Road, Lansdowne Park, New Road,

Thomondgate, and Brown’s Quay-O’Dwyer’s Villas, Thomondgate, and

Rathbane.

Irish Water is now embarking on a programme to replace lead services

in Ballynanty, Kileely and St. Mary’s Park.

Over the years, the Council would also have replaced lead services

when carrying out repairs/refurbishment and redevelopment to houses

in its housing stock. In addition to this, many households would have

replaced lead connections themselves.

Accordingly, it is difficult to be precise as to the exact location and

number of remaining lead connections. Work being carried out by Irish

Water at present will inform this process and provide a more accurate

15

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Daly and generally agreed.

**REPLY:**

In 2014 to date, Limerick City and County Council has taken-in-charge

twenty-sever (27) housing estates. A further nine (9) estates will be

taken-in-charge by year’s end. The Council has continued to work with

Residents’ Associations, Developers, Receivers, Banks, etc. to release

funds that allow works to be undertaken to bring estates to a standard

where they can be taken-in-charge.

In 2014, the Council provided a sum of €120,000 from the

Development Fund for works on unfinished housing estates, as part of

a multi-annual programme. It is intended that funding will be made

available in 2015 from the Development Fund to continue with this

work. A report on the Development Fund allocations will be brought to

Council early in 2015.

It was requested that a list of all estates not yet taken-in-charge would be

made available to Members.

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council supports***

***the introduction of bye-laws or other measures which would ensure that***

***Circuses which use animals are prohibited from performing in any lands or***

***properties under the ownership of Limerick City and County Council in light of***

***the well-documented evidence of suffering endured by the animals involved***

***and the serious animal welfare issues raised.***

Councillor Butler proposed the Motion and considerable discussion ensued on

same.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M).

It was agreed to refer the matter to the relevant Strategic Policy Committee.

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on***

***the Minister for Health to relocate the Maternity Hospital from its current site***

***on the Ennis Road to the University Hospital Limerick Campus in Dooradoyle***

***as a matter of urgency.***

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council reverse***

***the policy to no longer erect ‘Children at Play’ signs on county roads where it***

***is necessary.***

Councillor Neville, in proposing the Motion, stated that it was paramount that

these signs be erected where necessary.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council does not have a policy against the

provision of ‘Children at Play’ signs on public roads. However, all

requests are considered on a case-by-case basis. There is, however,

a presumption that these signs would not be appropriate for rural roads

where the general speed limit applies.

21.

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council supports***

***the call from the Restaurants’ Association of Ireland for the ongoing retention***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor

Butler.

***the Bin Voucher Scheme that operates in the County so as to treat all citizens***

***of the amalgamated Authority equally.***

scheme be reviewed to ensure equality in the City and County.

Councillor Mitchell seconded the Motion.---
17

**REPLY:**

The Council currently operates two waiver subsidy schemes for waste

collection charges. However, it is intended to introduce one scheme to

operate from 1st January, 2015. A draft Refuse Waiver Scheme for

Limerick City and County Council is presently being prepared and will

be presented to the Council in the coming months. The funding for the

Budget for 2015.

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this local authority put a Programme/Plan***

***in place for seasonal signs for small businesses in our towns and villages.***

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, stated that in these difficult

economic times, small businesses should be assisted by being allowed to promote

their business.

Councillor Neville seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

Signs such as sandwich boards, notices, banners and posters on

public paths and roads are licensed under Planning legislation to

ensure that they do not impede access, are safe, do not become litter,

and comply with legislation. All temporary signs require a temporary

sign licence or an exemption (certain political or public events).

The relevant Sections of the Council (Economic Development &

Planning, Transportation, and Environment) have prepared a Guide to

Temporary Signage. Before the public release of the Guide, it is to be

brought to the Planning Strategic Policy Committee for consideration.

It was noted that Item No. 24 had been dealt with earlier in the Meeting.

25.

***change the criteria for the Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) to include***

***the removal of dangerous bends and to improve car parking spaces near***

***churches and schools. This would be a welcome addition to a scheme that***

***has proven very popular for rural communities.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ryan and seconded by Councillor

Scanlan.---

26.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council contain***

***Non Principal Private Residence (NPPR) arrears which were unknowingly due***

***from property owners residing abroad to €1,000, being the charge covering the***

***period that this tax applied.***

Councillor Scanlan, in proposing the Motion, stated that there were a number

of cases of people living abroad who had been unaware of the requirement to pay

NPPR. He asked if the penalties could be waived in certain cases.

Councillor Sheahan (J) seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

The charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR) was introduced

in 2009 under the Local Government (Charges) Act, 2009, as

amended. The charge is self-declaration and it is a matter for persons

who own a non-principal private residence on the liability date to

declare so and to pay the €200 charge by the due date annually. The

charge is payable by the owners to the local authority in whose area

the property concerned is located. The charge is no longer applicable

since 2014.

Under the legislation, it is a function of Limerick City and County

Council to collect all charges on non-principal private residences and

associated late payment penalties due to it. Within Section 9 of the

Local Government (Charges) Act, 2009 (collection, care and

management of charge), it states that all charges and late payment

fees imposed and payable to a local authority, pursuant to this Act, are

placed under the care and management of the local authority

concerned and to deal with matters associated with such collection.

Although an owner may not be domiciled in the country, at a period in

time, the local authority is still providing essential services to the

property located within its administrative area.

Throughout the period of the NPPR charge, there have been extensive

advertising campaigns, both locally and nationally. Many of these

articles, debates and discussions have been available for streaming

throughout the world and details of the NPPR have been available on

local authority websites.

Limerick City and County Council has been consistent in its application

of the legislation and has sought to be fair and equitable to all its

customers and stakeholders. If a person has an issue with payment of

the NPPR and if he or she is not satisfied with a response given, then

they have the option to raise the matter with the Office of the

Ombudsman.---

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Keller

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council scrap the***

***new HAP (Housing Assistance Payment) Scheme which deems those in***

***private rental accommodation as 'housed' and instead demand State funding***

***for a programme of public works to build social and affordable housing.***

Councillor Keller, in proposing the Motion, stated that more emphasis should

be placed on building social and affordable housing as distinct from HAP.

Councillor Browne seconded the Motion.

Members outlined the history and reasons for the creation of HAP and also

referred to RAS (Rental Accommodation Scheme). Members expressed concerns

regarding both Schemes.

The Meetings Administrator read the following Reply in order to clarify the

legal position in relation to the Motion and the fact that the power to ‘scrap’ the

Scheme did not come within the remit of the Council.

**REPLY:**

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme commenced for

Limerick City and County Council on 15th September, 2014, under the

Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2014. As the Scheme is now

law, Limerick City and County Council has no power to ‘scrap’ the

scheme and is statutorily obliged to implement it.

It was agreed that the Motion would be amended and that the Council would

write to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government calling

for people on HAP to retain their position on the housing waiting list.

28.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council registers***

***its opposition to the planned introduction of water charges, and supports the***

***people of Limerick who actively resist and oppose this unjust tax.***

Councillor Prendiville, in proposing the Motion, referred to the ongoing

campaign of opposition to water charges and called on the Council to support the

people of Limerick who were actively resisting the introduction of the charges.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.

During the ensuing debate, it was suggested that the Motion would be

modified to read ‘domestic’ water charges as businesses and the farming community

were already paying water charges.---
20

Following further discussion, the Cathaoirleach directed that a vote be taken

by a show of hands. The result of the vote was 9 votes in favour of the Motion and

12 votes against, with no abstentions, and the Cathaoirleach declared the Motion

defeated.

29.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Loftus

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council***

***disengage from participating in any further Gateway/JobBridge Schemes.***

Councillor Loftus, in proposing the Motion, expressed concerns regarding

the schemes and the conditions under which people were employed on the

schemes.

Councillor Prendiville seconded the Motion.

Some Members expressed concerns that the Motion was giving the wrong

message and that there was a considerable number of people interested in the

schemes.

The Chief Executive clarified that the Elected Council had no role in relation

to staffing and employment issues.

**REPLY:**

**Gateway** is a Government initiative to reduce unemployment. The

Scheme provides short-term work opportunities and training (22

months) for people who have been in receipt of jobseekers’ allowance

for a minimum of 24 months. The objective of the scheme is to bridge

the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce. The

Council has been assigned a total of 150 participants under the

scheme and currently has 85 people employed in work such as

community based environmental improvement works, including estate

improvement work in local authority estates, graveyards, etc., as well

as library and office based projects. The Council has a further 13

people to commence on 22nd September, 2014.

**JobBridge** is a National Internship Scheme that provides work

experience placements for a 6 month or 9 month period. The aim of

the scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are

unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the

labour market after education or training, or as unemployed workers

wishing to learn new skills. The scheme gives people a real

opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between

study and the beginning of their working lives. The Council currently

has 6 people gaining work experience under the scheme and 1 person

with Limerick City of Culture.

The Schemes have had a positive impact for both the participants and

the local communities where they operate.---

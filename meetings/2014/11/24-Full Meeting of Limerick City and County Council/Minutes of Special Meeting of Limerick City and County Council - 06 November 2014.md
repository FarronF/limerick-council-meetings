The Cathaoirleach stated that the Special Meeting had been convened to discuss

the issue of Water Charges following receipt of a Requisition signed by a number of

Members as follows:

**“Under Standing Orders (Special Meeting, Sections 15 and 16), we wish**

**to call for a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council to**

**discuss the issue of Water Charges. We are requesting that this**

**Meeting be convened as soon as possible.”**

**Ceallaigh,**

**McMahon, Browne, McCreesh.**

The Meetings Administrator stated that the Cathaoirleach had agreed to allow the

following Motion, originally submitted by Councillor Quinlivan for the November

Meeting, to be put to the Special Meeting and Members had been notified of this on

4th November:
---

**“That, Limerick City and County Council calls on the Government to: (1)**

**immediately stop domestic water charges which are an unfair and unjust**

**double charge being forced on already struggling households; (2)**

**immediately stop the installation of meters across the country; (3)**

**recognise that Irish Water is not fit for purpose since it is unaccountable**

**to the Minister and therefore to the Oireachtas and the citizens of this**

**State; and (4) listen to the widespread public anger that exists towards**

**Irish Water by the Irish people who are now rightly organising and**

**mobilising in protest and opposition to these water charges through the**

**Right2Water public campaign which includes activists, citizens,**

**community groups, political parties and trade unions.”**

Councillor Quinlivan, in proposing the Motion, stated that the Government had

underestimated the level of public anger at the imposition of domestic water charges.

Citizens had had enough of relentless austerity with one tax after another being

imposed and many were simply not able to afford this additional charge. He stated

that his party was standing firmly with those families and hard-pressed citizens who

could not afford to pay the tax.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Browne.

Councillor Collins (M), on behalf of his party, proposed an Amendment to the Motion

as follows:

**“That, Limerick City and County Council calls on the Minister for the**

**Environment, Community and Local Government to suspend water**

**charges with a view to the winding up of Irish Water. It is also our wish**

**that the management and running of the business of providing water to**

**citizens of this country be handed back to the Local Authorities. We also**

**call on the Minister, as part of this Motion, to take into account people's**

**ability to pay. We also call on this Government to join us in recognising**

**the fact that a large percentage of people in rural Ireland are already**

**paying for water and have been for many decades, together with**

**commercial businesses in our towns and city. Finally, meters should be**

**installed for the sole purpose of detecting abuse and wastage of water.”**

In proposing the Amendment, Councillor Collins (M) stated that his party was in

support and in solidarity with the people who could not afford to pay the charge. He

added that the Government had failed to recognise that many families were beyond

stretching point financially and simply did not have the money to pay. In particular,

he referred to the most vulnerable in society. He stated that the vast majority of

people recognised that there was a cost associated with the supply of water and his

party had no issue with paying for water provided that people’s ability to pay was

taken into account.

The Amendment was seconded by Councillor Gleeson.

Councillor Keller, on behalf of his party, proposed an Amendment to the Motion as

follows:

**“*That, Limerick City and County Council wholeheartedly supports those***

***actively resisting the introduction of water charges, organising the***

***largest possible non-payment of the bills and halting the installation of***

***water meters and calls on the Government to:*** **(1) immediately stop**

**domestic water charges which are an unfair and unjust double charge**

**being forced on already struggling households; (2) immediately stop**

**the installation of meters across the country; (3) recognise that Irish**

**Water is not fit for purpose since it is unaccountable to the Minister and**

**therefore to the Oireachtas and the citizens of this State; and (4) listen**

**to the widespread public anger that exists towards Irish Water by the**

**Irish people who are now rightly organising and mobilising in protest**

**and opposition to these water charges through the Right2Water public**

**campaign which includes activists, citizens, community groups, political**

**parties and trade unions.”**

In proposing the Amendment, Councillor Keller stated that a public revolt against

water charges was taking place, that the movement should be supported by

Members and that widespread non-payment of water charges needed to be

organised. The movement saw 100,000 take to the streets of Dublin and 15,000 to

the streets of Limerick. He stated that his party was helping to build organised non-

payment of this double tax.

The Amendment was seconded by Councillor Loftus.

Councillor Leddin, on behalf of his party, proposed an Amendment to the Motion as

follows:

***“That Limerick City and County Council calls on the Government to***

***keep ownership and control of water in the hands of the Irish people by***

***way of Referendum and it is essential that if charges are introduced,***

***they are capped and only paid on a person’s ability to pay.”***

In proposing the Amendment, Councillor Leddin stated that his party was in support

of the principle that water should be managed centrally and in co-operation with the

local authorities. In this regard, he referred to the high level of investment that would

be required in the future to improve water infrastructure in the country. He added

that the legislation had been rushed and that any charge should be based on a

person’s ability to pay.

The Amendment was seconded by Councillor Daly.

Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that his party would not be supporting the Motions as

outlined at the Meeting. He said that his party acknowledged the frustration of the

people of Limerick City and County and accepted that the issue had not been

handled well at national level. However, as the Taoiseach had given a commitment

that the matter would be reviewed in the coming fortnight, his party was of the view

that the outcome of this should be awaited.

Following further discussion, the Cathaoirleach directed that a Vote be taken on

each of the Amendments and the result of the voting was as follows:

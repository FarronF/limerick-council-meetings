dates in our history up to 1923. The Committee I have selected consists of the five

persons who have been agreed to be the 5 Cathaoirligh over the life of this Council

together with the five Leas-Chathaoirligh over the same period. It should be noted that

this Committee will have absolutely no power to make decisions but will make

recommendations to the full Council for consideration.

Gaelic style font will be used in order to differentiate between the Irish and English

names on these signs. This will be implemented on a basis of new signage required, and

will not require the replacement of any signs due to this bye-law alone.

• The Meetings Administrator referred to the Minutes of the Inaugural Meeting

of 6th June, 2014, in relation to appointments to the Governing Authority of the

University of Limerick (UL). Councillors O’Dea and Scanlan had been

appointed at that Meeting to the Governing Authority.

He explained that in the past and in accordance with the Universities Act,

1997, the Cathaoirleach of Limerick County Council, or his/her nominee, and

the Mayor of Limerick, were ex-officio Members of the Governing Authority.

He clarified that the Local Government Reform Act, 2014, provided that the

Cathaoirleach of Limerick City and County Council, or a person nominated by

him/her, and the Cathaoirleach of the Municipal District which contained the

administrative area of the former Limerick City Council, were now the ex-

officio Members of the Governing Authority. He further confirmed that there

was no provision in the legislation for the Cathaoirleach of the Municipal

District (Mayor) to nominate a person to be a Member of the Governing

Authority in his stead.

It was noted that Councillor O’Dea was the Cathaoirleach’s nominee and that

this appointment would not change.

The Meetings Administrator explained that as Councillor Scanlan’s

appointment was in conflict with the legislation, this appointment could not

stand.

Accordingly, he confirmed the appointment of (i) Councillor Michael Sheahan,

Mayor, and (ii) the Cathaoirleach’s nominee, Councillor O’Dea, to the

Governing Authority of the University of Limerick.

• The Meetings Administrator referred to the Minutes of Meeting of 7th July, 2014,

in relation to appointments to the Local Community Development Committee and

West Limerick Resources. He clarified that where 2 or more persons were to be

appointed, the Grouping system in accordance with Paragraph 18 of Schedule 10

of the Local Government Act, 2001, applied. As the Grouping system had not

been applied to these appointments, the nomination of Members to both Bodies

would have to be re-visited.

Councillor O’Dea requested an amendment to the Minutes of the Special

Meeting held on 29th August, 2014, in relation to the late Mary Harty, to reflect the

fact that he had conveyed an apology for his inability to attend the Meeting.

Councillor Quinlivan requested that, in view of the historical nature of the

Inaugural Meeting held on 6th June, an amendment be made to the Minutes to reflect

the fact that each of the Party Leaders had, in turn, spoken at the Meeting.

Both amendments were agreed.

future gratuity costs.

Proposed by Councillor Byrne;

Seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the setting aside

of monies for pension gratuities to a specific ring-fenced reserve in line with the

provisions of the Local Authority Accounting in Ireland Code of Practice and

Raising of Loan

Circulated, Chief Executive’s report dated 17th September, 2014, seeking the

Council’s approval to seek sanction from the Minister for the Environment,
---
9

Community and Local Government for a loan of €32m for re-financing of Limerick

City and County Council.

The Chief Executive advised Members that he was placing this request before

the Council in an attempt to push forward with the vision for Limerick as set out in the

respective Development Plans and in Limerick 2030. He went on to say that these

Plans had the potential and vision to deliver significant growth to Limerick. A strong

Limerick, he emphasised, would lead to a strong region and it was essential that the

Council now take the next steps to achieve its ambition.

He highlighted that over the previous 24 months, there had been a renewed

interest in Limerick’s future. The Airport, under new leadership, was setting out its

ambitious plans for investment and growth. Foynes Port had also outlined its plans

for the expansion of port related activities in the following years. It was noted that

alliances had recently been developed with the Third Level Sector, the economic

agencies and the private sector with a view to having a cohesive and comprehensive

approach to future investment. The Chief Executive outlined that investment in job

creation had amounted to almost €1 billion over the previous two years by such

companies as Regeneron, Vistacon, Ethicon, Northern Trust, Viagogo. The Council

had, for its part, supported businesses through rate reductions, development levy

reductions and business incentive schemes.

In conclusion, the Chief Executive said he was seeking Council approval to

borrow €32 million to address in the coming years the deficiency in capital spend in

the economic, social and community sectors. The restriction in the Council’s capacity

to spend, he added, was well known and showed no sign of relief. The Council, he

highlighted, required immediate funding to further enshrine the merger process and

accelerate the Council’s role as a key driver for change and innovation, not only for

the citizens of Limerick but for the entire Mid-West Region.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Leddin;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to seek sanction

from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in

accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act, 2001, for a loan of €32m

under Section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.”

(d)

Overdraft Accommodation

Circulated, report from the Head of Finance dated 19th September, 2014,

seeking the Council’s approval to the terms of an overdraft facility €37.5m and the

terms of various term loans amounting to €3,220,299.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Leddin;

And Resolved:
---
10

“That, in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act, 2001, the

approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the terms of an overdraft facility

amounting to €37,500,000 and the terms of various term loans amounting to

€3,220,299 to be made available by Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. to Limerick City and

County Council,subject to the terms and conditions referred to in the letter of

sanction dated 3rd July, 2014, addressed by the Bank to the Council.”

(e)

Local Property Tax

Circulated, (i) report from the Head of Finance dated 17th September, 2014,

and (ii) Variation of Base Rate of Local Property Tax 2015 - Report on Public

Submissions dated 17th September.

The Head of Finance introduced this item by informing Members that a local

authority could, as a Reserved Function, resolve to vary the basic rate of the Local

Property Tax (LPT) within its functional area by a maximum of +/-15%. He added

that any decision to vary the basic rate of LPT must be taken by 30th September

each year in order to take effect from 1st November (the liability date) and therefore

determine the LPT liability of taxpayers for the following year.

The Head of Finance gave a Powerpoint presentation under the following

headings:

• Βackground/Legislation.

• Budget Process.

• Budget Process/Rates.

• LPT Financial Consequences of Variation.

• Potential Impact on the LPT revenue in the forthcoming year.

The Chief Executive addressed the Meeting and confirmed that the gains

made in 2013 in relation to the Local Government Fund had been left with the

Council for 2014. He explained that the additional funding received of €3.5 million,

taken in tandem with overall efficiencies in 2013, had allowed for the equalisation of

rates in the City and County. He referred to the reduction in direct provision of

services by the Council in recent years and made reference to drivers’ licences, dog

licences, higher education grants, maintenance of motorways and water/waste

water. He stressed the importance of investing in local services and further

strengthening and securing the Council’s relevance to the community.

In conclusion, he stated that a reduction in the LPT rate would either mean

further cuts or alternative local tax increases. He cautioned that the decisions made

now could have a lasting impact on how the Council would operate as an Authority.

He confirmed that no additional funding from the equalisation fund would be

provided.

On the proposal of Councillor Collins (M), seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon, it

was agreed to take a 15 minute adjournment.

conjunction with this item.

Following some discussion, the Cathaoirleach indicated that, in view of time

constraints, he was calling a Special Meeting of the Council to allow for further

was agreed that the Special Meeting would taken place on Tuesday, 30th

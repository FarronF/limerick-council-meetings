Development Plan. He stated that Ballyneety Golf Club incorporated a 183 acre site, of

crazy golf, general sports area, ball alleys and Astroturf pitch. Mr. O'Donnell stated that
the committee was seeking funding from Limerick City and County Council of €50,000 per

3. Environment and Water

Gortad ndfil

The Senior Executive Engineer, Environment, gave an update to Members on queries
arising from last month’s Meeting regarding the Proposed Lease of Gortadroma Landfill
and bid made by Cadence EnviroPower. Members felt that they did not have enough
information on the proposed waste to energy facility to form an opinion on the matter and
requested that a delegation from Cadence EnviroPower be asked to give a presentation to
the next District Meeting. Members queried why Gortadroma Landfill Site was chosen and
requested the proposal be evaluated against a similar facility.

4. Home and Social Development

The Executive Engineer, Housing, gave an update on the Housing Repairs Programme
and circulated report in relation to housing maintenance in the Rathkeale Area.

The report stated that the budget allocation for maintenance of local authority houses in
the Rathkeale area for 2014 was €121,000, of which 70% was expended. The report
further stated that the most frequent maintenance issues were electrical problems
including replacement of electric showers, window and door locks, catches and seals,
gutters, fire backs burnt out and water leaks.

The report also gave an outline of the number of vacant properties in the Area and the
properties awaiting pre-letting works. The annual allocation for pre-letting for 2014 was
€77,000.00.

Additional once off funding of €202,000.00 under the ‘Returning Voids to Productive Use
Fund’ was received for work on 22 of the vacant houses. Typical works carried out under
this fund included replacement of storage heating with either oil or solid fuel central
heating, essential repairs including roof and internal repairs, installation of kitchens in a
small number of units, cleaning and limited painting of the interior.

On the proposal of Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor Neville, it was suggested that
tenants who bore the cost of improvement works on their local authority houses should
have their rent reduced accordingly. It was felt that this would reduce the pressure on
Council Staff to do these works.

Members queried if the Council had tendered for plumbing and carpentry services and
requested that a list be drawn up with expressions of interest from qualified

plumbers/carpenters.

Members expressed their concern regarding the practice of boarding up houses as soon
as the local authority house became vacant and every effect should be made to speed up
the pre-letting work on houses. Members queried when the next Council Purchase
Scheme would take place.

5. Travel and Transportation

The Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, gave an update on county roads programme for
the District. Members queried Council policy on erecting ‘Play Signs’ on roads to signify to
motorists the possibility of children playing in the area.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, indicated that it would not be appropriate to erect
‘play signs’ on local county roads where an 80 km speed limit applied but that other more
appropriate signs and / or road markings would be looked at on a case by case basis.

6. Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

! will ask at the next Meeting what are the Council’s proposals for dealing with
excess storm flooding on the Station Road, Adare.

REPLY: A severe flash flood event occurred on Friday morning, 19th September,
2014, between the hours of 9am and 10am in the vicinity of Adare village.

Limerick City & County Council staff attended the incident immediately and
addressed the flooding issues.

There is an existing 225mm surface water system that is operational. There
are 2 no vulnerable properties that were effected by the recent weather

event.

In the short term, Limerick City & County Council proposes the placement of
floodgates to prevent floodwaters entering these buildings. Longer term,
Limerick City & County Council will seek funding from the National Roads
Authority to increase the capacity of the surface water drainage system.

7. Questions submitted by Councillor C. McMahon

! will ask at the next Meeting, from a road safety perspective, if letters have been
sent out to farmers regarding hedge cutting. If so, what is the Council’s procedure

for non-compliance.

REPLY: Section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993, obliges landowners and occupiers of land
to take all reasonable care to ensure that trees, hedges and other vegetation
growing on their land are not, or could not become, a danger to people using
or working on a public road.

If a tree, hedge or other vegetation is, or could become, a danger to those
using or working on a public road, the local authority can serve a written
notice on the owner or occupier requiring action to be taken in order to
remove the danger or potential danger. The local authority can carry out the
works specified in the notice itself in any case where the person on whom
the notice was served fails to comply with it.

Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the local
authority can act at once (without serving a notice) to remove or reduce the
danger. In either case, the local authority may recover its cost of the works
from the landowner or occupier.

It is an offence not to comply with the terms of a notice served by a local
authority.

Letters to landowners in the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale issued
three weeks ago advising them of their obligations regarding this Section of
the Roads Act, 1993.

In relation to the Shrulawn Road in Foynes, the Area Office has made direct
contact with the landowners requesting that overgrown trees/hedges be cut
back within the next two weeks. In the interim, the road has been assessed
and there are no safety issues arising as a result of overgrown hedges at this
location at the present time.

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council erect electronic speed indicators in
Kilfinny village.

Councillor Neville, in proposing the Motion, stated that electronic speed indicators were a
very effective way of reducing speed.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keary.

REPLY:

Signed:

Dated:

The Travel & Transportation Department will carry out a traffic survey,
including a speed survey, to assess the need for speed reduction measures
in Kilfinny.

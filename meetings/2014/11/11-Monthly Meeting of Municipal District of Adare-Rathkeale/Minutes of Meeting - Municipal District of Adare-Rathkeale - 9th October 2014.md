e In response to questions regarding special projects, he confirmed that it was
proposed that a figure would be provided in each District for special projects.
It was noted that the total amount allocated for special projects in each of the
Municipal Districts was €100,000, with €150,000 being provided for the
Metropolitan District. He outlined that these projects must specify a minimum
spend of €50,000 each and it was envisaged that this spend would be for
projects of a specific and strategic nature.

e Regarding the GMA, he confirmed that it was not additional money but rather
a new focus on how the existing budget was allocated. He clarified that any
increase in the overall GMA would have to be carried out in conjunction with
an increase in local charges for local services in the District.

e Responding to Members’ queries as to whether a percentage of the monies
realised from the sale of property or land in a Municipal Area could be ring-
fenced for the Municipal Area, the Head of Finance indicated that selling
Council property/land to realise money could not be recommended in the
current economic climate. He stressed the importance of maintaining a
strategic focus in relation to Council owned property/land.

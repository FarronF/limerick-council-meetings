under Standing Orders, a Special Committee of the Metropolitan District could only be

appointed for a specific purpose.

Part 8 Procedure - Proposed Neighbourhood Park in the Grounds

of Mungret College, Limerick\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Already circulated report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning dated

10th September, 2014 enclosing Chief Executive's Report in relation to the proposed

Mungret Neighbourhood Park and also report of the Director of Economic Development

and Planning dated 13th October, 2014 which was an addendum to the Chief Executive's

Report of the 10th September, 2014.

The Chief Executive's Report set out details of the proposed development under a number

of headings and was prepared and submitted to the Members pursuant to Section 179 of

the Planning and Development Acts, 2000 - 2014, and Part 8 of the Planning and

Development Regulations, 2001 - 2013.

The report stated that plans and particulars went on public display from 7th July, 2014 to

18th August, 2014 and a public information evening was held on 15th July, 2014. It was

proposed to proceed in accordance with the Chief Executives Report and the changes

outlined in the report of the 13th October, 2014.

The report was noted by the Members who welcomed the proposed development and

thanked the planning staff for engaging with local residents in relation to concerns raised.

They stressed the importance of continued meaningful engagement with the residents

who had ongoing concerns in relation to traffic management, security, fencing and parking

management and had indicated a need for monitored CCTV and a warden on site.

The archaeological heritage of the site, along with the old black walk, were noted as

potential tourist attractions and Members highlighted the potential of the site to also
---
facilitate sporting, recreational, community and educational use and requested that a

master plan for the development of the site be drawn up to take these uses into

consideration.

In response to issues raised by the Members, the Director, Economic Development and

Planning indicated that security and traffic management at the site would be addressed

and the input of local residents would be taken into consideration, going forward. In

addition, he undertook to review a site adjacent to the proposed development with a view

to assessing its potential for inclusion in any further plans for the area.

The Mayor returned at this point and resumed the Chair.

4.

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***What is the current position re the 20 acres of land situated at Ballykeeffe which***

***was formerly identified for the location of the neighbourhood park? This land, I***

***understand, was to be transferred to the ownership of Limerick County Council in***

***lieu of outstanding development levies.***

**REPLY**:

The 18 acres of land at Ballykeeffe was to be transferred to Limerick County

Council by the developer for a Neighbourhood Park following the rezoning of

other lands in the area from open space to residential in 2002.

Contracts to progress the transfer have been drafted but have yet to be

agreed between the respective solicitors. Work is ongoing in resolving the

outstanding issues (way leaves, joint ownership issues, access, etc.) It is

expected that the ownership of these lands will transfer to Limerick City &

County Council in 2015.

5.

Question submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***What is the status of the ownership of the land that was the original site for the***

***Neighbourhood Playground that is now planned for Mungret College Grounds?***

***The Playground at this location was to be provided as part of a deal between the***

***developer and the Council but was never fulfilled by the developer. This question***

***was asked at the Metropolitan District Meeting on 21**st*** ***July, 2014, and again at the***

***Metropolitan District Meeting on 15**th*** ***September, 2014, but no response has been***

***received.***

**REPLY**:

The 18 acres of land at Ballykeeffe was to be transferred to Limerick County

Council by the developer for a Neighbourhood Park following the rezoning of

other lands in the area from open space to residential in 2002.

Contracts to progress the transfer have been drafted but have yet to be

agreed between the respective solicitors. Work is ongoing in resolving the

outstanding issues (way leaves, joint ownership issues, access, etc.) It is

expected that the ownership of these lands will transfer to Limerick City &

County Council in 2015.

As Items No. 6, 10 and 11 related to the same location, it was agreed to take them

together at this point.

6.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

***I will move at the next Meeting, in relation to the riverbank at Westfield Park and the***

***breach that occurred resulting in flooding just short of the houses in Westfield Park***

***and damage to the riverside path and the closing of part of same path, that***

***Limerick City and County Council put plans in place immediately to make safe this***

***amenity, reopen the path to the public and allow for an increase in the water flow***

***between the River Shannon and Westfield Lake and visa versa.***

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Michael Hourigan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council restore the***

***walk on the river bank from St. Michael’s Boat Club to Barrington’s Pier. This***

***riverside walk is an important amenity to the people of Limerick City.***

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Michael Hourigan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council carry out***

***works to clear reeds in the wetland area adjacent to the Condell Road, in particular,***

***the viewing stand as this amenity is in severe danger of being lost without***

***maintenance work.***

The motions were proposed and seconded by Councillors Crowley and Hourigan.

Councillor Crowley pointed out that the flow between the lake and the river had reduced

dramatically and the excessive growth of reed in the lake was causing it to stagnate. He

stated that local residents had signed a petition outlining their concerns in this regard.

Councillor Hourigan highlighted the importance of the wetland with 31 species of birds

recorded there and its protection under the Habitats Directive. He noted that the level of

water in the wetland was decreasing annually and called for the proliferation of elder and

willow scrub to be removed. He pointed out that the road had impacted adversely on the

wetland and called on the Council to seek expert advice on the flow of water to be

maintained into the wetland.

**REPLY:**

The breach of the Riverside Embankment that occurred along the Condell

Road occurred as a result of over topping of the Embankment by flood water

from the river during the high tide of Saturday, 1st February 2014. The water

overtipping the embankment washed away some of the riverside path as

well as the inside of the embankment.

The riverside path along this embankment at this location is not currently

suitable for pedestrians as it is dangerous and remains closed. Pedestrians

can use the new footpath that runs along the Condell Road to get around

this closure.

The City and County Council has made an application for funding to

Government to carry out extensive repairs to this embankment including

raising the height of the embankment. This funding application has not yet

been approved by Government. As part of constructing the new

embankment a new footpath can be constructed along the riverside as part

of the scheme.
---
Limerick City and County Council are not aware of any problems with the

flow of water between Westfields and the River Shannon, however

arrangements have been made to carry out inspections on the pipe and

valves controlling this flow.

The Council is not in a position to carry out works to clear reeds in the

wetland area of Westfields at this time as the expenditure involved would not

represent value for money at this stage. The reed growth is the evolution of

a natural habitat and the water levels have not altered sufficiently to warrant

the extremely expensive procedure of reed removal. We will undertake to

monitor the water levels to assess the visibility of water in the area on an

ongoing basis."

Councillor Crowley queried as to whether private funding could be utilised to carry out

works at this location and the Meetings Administrator agreed to follow up on same.

7.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council carry out the***

***necessary refurbishment works to Mungret College to enable local community***

***groups and voluntary organisations to benefit through the use of this building for***

***the common good.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Leddin stated that the purchase of Mungret College

afforded the Council an opportunity to secure and refurbish the building for community and

voluntary use and that this sector should be engaged with to establish how best use could

be made of the building. He expressed concerns that the building might be used for

commercial purposes.

In seconding the motion, Councillor McCreesh stressed the need to secure the building

and to make it available for community groups.

Councillor Collins noted the need for community and voluntary facilities in the area and

stressed the need for the development of a master plan for the site and for the Members

to be involved in same. He requested a date by which this plan would be provided and

that any lands made available from the site would be sold at the social cost.

**REPLY**:

Contracts for the acquisition for Mungret College and lands have been

signed by the Council, the deposit paid and the signed contracts returned to

the solicitor for the Receiver. The Council is awaiting confirmation of

signature from their side. It is expected that the Council will have

possession by early November 2014.

The Mungret College building needs extensive remedial works and

refurbishments in order to be ready for future use. In this regard the Council

has engaged Conservation Architects and Quantity Surveyors to identify and

cost the necessary works.

The Council is aware through Councillors, Community Groups, Sporting

bodies, etc. that there is a strong demand for community / sporting facilities

in the Mungret / Southern Environs area. It is anticipated that much of this

demand will be satisfied through the development of the buildings and lands

of the college.
---
In that regard a comprehensive master plan for the building and lands is to

be drawn up. The initial phase of such a plan has commenced with the

commencement of a Traffic Study for the area.

In conclusion, the Meetings Administrator indicated that security issues at the site would

be followed up on.

8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council examine the***

***feasibility of allocating dedicated public notice locations for the placement of***

***temporary signage so as to prohibit the placement of signage indiscriminately***

***throughout the city and county which is a total eyesore and litter problem.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Leddin stated that he was putting forward a best

practice approach for this issue to prevent littering and other problems associate with

flyposting.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Byrne highlighted the issue of flyposting on derelict

sites and closed buildings and the benefits of having dedicated locations for such posters

at strategic locations.

A Member expressed the view that the motion should be taken further by banning the

erection of election posters and while a view was expressed that there would be an issue

in identifying suitable designated sites in the county, a contrary view was expressed that

there were already sufficient community notice boards in place in the county. It was also

pointed out that, with the increased use of social media, there was less need for the use of

posters.

The Meetings Administrator clarified that posters, advertising a public meeting, were

exempted under the Litter Pollution Act 1997.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will connect***

***any houses on the Old Clonmacken Road, not already connected, to the main***

***sewerage system and, in addition, that the connection to “Knocklyon” be***

***completely overhauled and an adequate sewerage system be incorporated to a***

***health and safety specification.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Crowley and seconded by Councillor Hourigan.

**REPLY**:

1. A connection to the public sewer may only be made following approval of

an application for such to Irish Water. Application forms for new connections

are available at Council Offices.

2. The Knocklyon sewerage system is the subject of ongoing negotiations

between the Planning Office and the insurance company holding the bond

for that development with a view to remediating the system to a standard

needed to facilitate its taking in charge by Irish Water.
---
Councillor Crowley sought guidance from the Council on how to progress this matter and

the Meetings Administrator undertook to arrange for the appropriate staff to talk to

Councillor Crowley.

11A. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council write to the***

***Minister for Health requesting an update on the review of acute services in the Mid***

***West which was proposed in June by the then Minister for Health. We should***

***communicate our support for the upgrading of St. John's Hospital to a Model 3***

***hospital as part, which would restore the A&E services at that hospital.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor

McCreesh.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Prendiville sought the support of the Members in

calling for the upgrade of St. Johns Hospital to a Model 3 hospital in order to restore the

A&E services there and alleviate the pressure on the A&E in University Hospital Limerick

where services had been centralised.

Members supported the motion and noted the regular overcrowding and long queues in

the University Hospital Limerick A&E and how inconvenient it was for some individuals in

the city to get out there. It was pointed out that people with minor injuries from Nenagh

and Ennis had no option but to attend at the University Hospital Limerick and that these

injuries should be attended to locally.

Councillor Hourigan noted that 34 beds had been opened in the University Hospital

Limerick, a new A&E was on stream and improvements in the A&E service had occurred

over the past six weeks.

As the time was approaching 12.15 p.m. it was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor

Byrne and seconded by Councillor Hourigan, that Standing Orders would be suspended

for 30 minutes to allow for the completion of the agenda and that the Adjourned Draft

Budgetary Plan Meeting would commence at the conclusion of the current meeting.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council give***

***consideration to the request by residents of Little Gerard Griffin Street to have the***

***ability to park on the street outside their homes whether by a permit system or***

***more permanent designated parking.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by Councillor Hurley.

In proposing the motion, Councillor McCreesh pointed out that this was a very busy street

and had ongoing issues associated with night clubs and taxis. He suggested that if the

street was only open to one way traffic it might help alleviate the problems.

**REPLY**:

These are City Council houses that were built by Limerick City Council and

no provision was made for off-street parking with this development. Current

parking regulations prohibit vehicle parking because of road width. No disc

parking operates on Little Gerald Griffin Street, therefore, the provision of
---
Resident Parking Permits is not applicable on this street. The Limerick City

& County Council Traffic Department have examined the site and can move

to allow on-street parking on one side of the street between 18.30pm and

8.00am hrs daily enabled by single yellow line provisions. To advance this a

member of staff can meet with the residents.

Councillor McCreesh requested a meeting with the appropriate Roads Staff to seek to

resolve this issue.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***I will move at the next Meeting that an immediate response is required from***

***Limerick City and County Council to the request to re-paint the markings on the***

***pedestrian and controlled crossings on Fr. Russell Road and St. Nessan Road in***

***the vicinity of St. Pauls Church and School.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by Councillor Collins.

In proposing the motion, Councillor McCreesh noted that this was a very dangerous

location for pedestrians and that similar re-painting of road markings was needed

throughout the city.

**REPLY**:

Arrangements have been made to replace the lining at the pedestrian

crossings at St. Pauls School on St. Nessans Road and the top of Fr Russell

Road. The work will be undertaken within the next two weeks.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council act***

***immediately to upgrade, clean and restore name and information plaques on the***

***1916 Memorial on Sarsfield Bridge, in preparation for the Centenary in 2016.***

It was agreed that this item would be brought to the full Council for discussion.

Members expressed their hopes that funding would be provided nationally to fund

centenary events in 2016 and that a cross party committee might be formed so that a

collective approach could be agreed.

It was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Hourigan

that Standing Orders would be suspended for a further 10 minutes to allow for the

completion of the agenda.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maria Byrne

***I will move at the next Meeting to have my Notice of Motion, which was passed re***

***parking initiatives, to be debated on the floor of this Chamber and bring forward***

***policy proposals on how we intend to deal with this problem, because it refers to***

***parking at Christmas and, if we are to wait until the SPC is set up, we will be talking***

***about Christmas 2015.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Butler.
---
In proposing the motion Councillor Byrne stressed the need to bring people into the city

for Christmas and proposed that solutions such as temporary redesignation of parking

bays, use of vacant sites and park and ride be considered.

In reply to the motion, the Senior Engineer stated that a number of costed options were

available for consideration and it was agreed that a small group, comprising

representatives from each political grouping, would arrange to meet with the Senior

Engineer, within days, to discuss same.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor James Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick call on the***

***Minister for Education and Skills to publish her Departments Report on***

***Configuration and Development of Post Primary Schools in Limerick City, Croom***

***and Pallaskenry 2014/2024 without further delay.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Collins noted the issues faced each year by students

seeking access to secondary schools and the confusion generated around the central

application system. He stated that there were not enough secondary school places

available in Limerick, a new secondary school was needed and a site for same should be

identified. He indicated that the answers to these issues were anticipated in the Minister's

Report and called on her to publish same.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Lynch noted that the Minister had announced an

Education Bill that promised more transparency with regard to access to schools and

called on her to publish same.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maria Byrne

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council put in place***

***immediately a dog fouling campaign and enhance this with the placing of dog***

***fouling bins in areas where there are no litter bins which can also be used to***

***dispose of dog litter.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Byrne welcomed the initiative that had been

announced in this regard.

Members highlighted the lack of appropriate bins in various locations and it was agreed

that they should bring these locations to the attention of the executive.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Hourigan called for spot checks to be carried out to

ensure that dog walkers carried appropriate receptacles to collect dog waste.

It was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Hourigan

that Standing Orders would be suspended for a further 10 minutes to allow for the

completion of the agenda.

**REPLY**:

The problem of dog fouling is an on-going issue throughout the city and

county. While there has been a significant increase in the number of dog

owners cleaning up after their dogs over the last 2 to 3 years, there are still

quite a number of owners who do not. This is an area that has been targeted

by the Councils Litter Team over the last year or so with greater resources
---
put in to the creation of awareness amongst the public of the nuisance

caused by dog litter and the resultant health risks.

In recent times a Dog Fouling Awareness Campaign commenced Monday

13th October and is being carried out in conjunction with the Gardai. Staff

from the Environment Department and Environmental Inspectors/Wardens

together with Gardai have been out and about meeting with dog owners to

raise awareness about the need to carry a bag and pick up after their dog.

The Council has also circulated press release and highlighted the issue on

local radio interviews as part of the campaign.

The Environment Dept will extend the campaign to other areas in the County

over the coming months. The main feature of the campaign is in increasing

the level of awareness amongst the dog owning public to be responsible dog

owners and clean up that dog litter.

The “Any Bag Any Bin” campaign has been quite effective in the City area

and will be rolled out throughout the county in the coming months. It is also

proposed to extend the Dog Litter and Dog Control Byelaws 2012 to cover

the whole county. These byelaws provide that “ Article 5.(1) any person

having charge of a dog shall at all times while exercising the dog in any

public place carry suitable receptacles to remove and dispose of dog

droppings immediately after the dog has deposited them. This receptacle

must be available for inspection by an authorised officer on request. Plastic

bags, paper bags or acceptable pooper scoopers are examples of proper

receptacles”.

Draft byelaws will be brought to the SPC for consideration in the coming

months.

There is also a need to consider additional areas for dog litter bins. The

installation of additional bins however is a draw on scarce resources and will

have to be carefully considered in this context in the more heavily

populated / walking areas. It is not possible to provide dog litter bins on a

widespread basis. In this regard dog owners in general will in the main be

required to dispose of the litter in their own bins on return from the walk.

We would finally like to extend our thanks to those owners who do clean up.

The most effective way to move the clean up campaign forward is by “word

of mouth” and “leading by example”, so that the practice of not cleaning up

after your dog becomes socially unacceptable amongst the general public.

Of course it should also be noted that there are heavy fines for not cleaning

up and the issuing of fines by both Litter Wardens and the Gardai will be

pursued following the current education / awareness campaign.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council include in the***

***Council Chamber, Dooradoyle, the Irish language sign for ‘Limerick City and***

***County Council’, which, in the Irish language, is ‘Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae***

***Luimnigh’, as well as the Irish translation for ‘Metropolitan District of Limerick’,***
---
***which is ‘Ceantar Cathrach Luimnigh’ in the Council Chamber, Merchant’s Quay.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan.

The Meetings Administrator informed the meeting that the Council was working on

signage in Irish, as indicated in the motion, and these signs would be erected as soon as

possible.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council provide a list***

***of Council houses in the Metropolitan District, both vacant and boarded up, and the***

***estimated time for the re-letting of these properties.***

In proposing the motion, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that while the Government had

announced a Local Authority Construction Initiative there were many vacant local authority

houses that could be used in the interim. He stated that many of these houses required

only minor works and these works should be carried out without delay as vacant houses

attract drink and drug use.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Quinlivan pointed out that leaving houses vacant can

lead to dumping and vandalism to the property and was unfair to neighbours. He stated

that a house in Ballynanty had been ready since May but was still boarded up and called

for houses to be reallocated on the day the previous tenants leave.

**REPLY**:

The information as requested will be collated and provided to Cmhlr. Séighin

Ó Ceallaigh in due course.

The Senior Executive Officer Housing pointed out that, depending on their condition,

varying amounts of works were required to be carried out to vacated houses and

undertook to address the issues raised by the Members.

The Deputy Manager suggested that this item be brought back to a future meeting.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Gerry O’Dea

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council address the***

***long term future and plans for our municipal golf course at Rathbane.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O'Dea and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

**REPLY**:

Rathbane Golf Course is a public 18 hole park land course located in the

southern outskirts of Limerick. The course is a Municipal facility and is

owned by Limerick City and County Council. Associated with the course is a

strong members club, Rathbane Golf Club. It is affiliated with the Golfing

Union of Ireland and the Irish Ladies Golf Union Ltd. It is one of the few golf

courses that offers golf at affordable prices, a place to play the game and

enjoy the game at a reasonable cost.

Rathbane Golf Course first opened to the public in 1998 and since then has

undergone a number of refurbishments. A significant upgrade of the course

was undertaken in 2010/2011. This upgrade included the construction of 18
---
new tee complexes, a new 9th hole featuring a new lake, a new practice

area that included a new practice putting green, an irrigation system and a

new short game area incorporating bunkers. In 2013 additional funding was

received from the Department of Trade Tourism and Sport towards the

upgrade of the sewerage system at the course and minor works to the

clubhouse.

Mack Trading International Ltd is the current operator of the Golf Course on

behalf of Limerick City and County Council. In August 2014, Limerick City

and County Council was informed by Mack Trading Ltd that it would no

longer be operating the golf course with effect from 30th September, 2014.

Following a number of meetings between Mack Trading and staff from this

local authority, Mack Trading have agreed to continue to operate the golf

course on a short term basis. It is proposed that a tender for an operator to

manage the course from 2015 will be issued shortly.

Limerick City and County Council is proud of the facility at Rathbane and is

committed to the 'public, socially inclusive' nature of the golf course which

attracts golfers from the city and county and the wider Mid-West region. The

long term future of the course requires an equity investment of approximately

€400,000. Discussions have taken place recently with the members of

Rathbane Golf Club regarding works that would enhance the clubhouse and

the purchase of equipment necessary to maintain the golf course to an

acceptable standard. The investment required may be considered as a

special project to be funded under the General Municipal Allocation.

Councillor O'Dea highlighted the importance of the course and the need to invest in

course maintenance equipment which was in poor condition and that such investment

would increase interest in companies tendering for the operation of the course.

Members outlined the benefits of the course in terms of tourism, job provision and social

inclusion and noted that the dressing rooms and clubhouse also need refurbishment.

Surprise was expressed that further investment was needed as the impression had been

given to the Members that the course was sustaining itself financially. Notwithstanding

this, Members indicated that the Council should do everything in its power to keep the

course open and called on the Council to write to the Minister of State, Michael Ring for

financial support.

This concluded the Meeting.

General Municipal Allocation - Financial Year Ending 31st

December, 2015

Already circulated, copy of report from Head of Finance dated 2nd October, 2014.

Members expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of the GMA that had been allocated to

the Metropolitan District compared to other Districts, the lack of consultation that had taken

place with regard to the distribution of the GMA between Districts and the lack of

involvement of Members in the overall budgetary process. They requested that proper

consultation with regard to the GMA take place in future and that the Head of Finance give

a presentation to Members giving details of the Metropolitan and overall budgetary

processes and the role of the Members in finalising both. It was also requested that the

Chief Executive correspond with Members in relation to special projects.

The Head of Finance pointed out that the timing of the Council's decision in relation to

property tax allowed only seven days in which to consult with Members in relation to the

GMA. He stressed that the GMA was part of the overall budget and that any adjustment to

the GMA would reflect on the amount remaining in the overall budget. He noted that once

the overall budget for the Council was adopted, a schedule of proposed works of

maintenance and repair for the Municipal District would be drawn up and the Members

could change the focus of those works.

The Deputy Chief Executive pointed out that the GMA was a new process and he

acknowledged the sentiments expressed by the Members in relation to same.

In response to queries raised by the Members, the Meetings Administrator pointed out that

if the Draft Budgetary Plan for the Metropolitan District was not adopted by the Members it
---
would go forward for inclusion in the overall budgetary process. He also clarified that the

Chief Executive was required to consult with the Corporate Policy Group in terms of the

overall Council budget.

Following a show of hands it was agreed, as proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded

by Councillor Clifford, that the Budgetary Plan for the Metropolitan Municipal District for the

financial year ended 31st December, 2015, as presented, in the total sum of €640,000 be

adopted in accordance with Section 102 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended.

This concluded the Meeting.

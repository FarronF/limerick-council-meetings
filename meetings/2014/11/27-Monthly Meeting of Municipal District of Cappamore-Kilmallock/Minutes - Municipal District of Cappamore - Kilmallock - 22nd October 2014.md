9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Ryan

1 will move at the next Meeting that the Council upgrade the public toilet
facilities at Lough Gur.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ryan and seconded by Councillor Teefy.

REPLY: There is a need for Improvement works to the public toilet facilities at
Lough Gur. Consideration is currently being given to the scale of the
works involved and the associated costs so that a decision on the level
of works can be taken in the near future. Given the importance of
Lough Gur from a visitor / tourism point of view, a submission will be
made for capital funding under the Development Fund for the project in
2015 so that the facility can be brought up to a satisfactory standard. If
such capital funding is not available, then minor improvements will be
carried out to deal with some of the issues arising in the interim.

This matter can be considered in line with other matters raised by the
Deputation from Lough Gur Development Cooperative Society Limited
at the October meeting.

10. Notice of Motion subm by Councillor M. Donegan

/ will move at the next Meeting that a staff member from the Environment
Section attend and brief the Members on the pollution of the River Lubagh in
August and outline the Council's plans to support Inland Fisheries Ireland and
the local Angling Club.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Donegan and seconded by Councillor
Sheehy.

REPLY: A study of Lough Gur is being carried out to understand the lake better.
The study is looking at inflows and outflows from the lake along with
the geology of the area to try and identify the surface water and ground
water catchments of the lake. This will allow the pressures on the lake
to be more clearly identified and allow measures to reduce nutrient
inputs to the lake to be targeted effectively. It is hoped, in the longer
term, that this will reduce algal blooms on the lake. The study is being
90% funded by Ballyhoura Development through the Rural
Development Fund. The lead partner is the Lough Gur Group Water
Scheme with Limerick City and County Council providing the balance
of funding.

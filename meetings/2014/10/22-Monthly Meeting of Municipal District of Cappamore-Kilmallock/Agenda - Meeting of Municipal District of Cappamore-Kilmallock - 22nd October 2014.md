QUESTIONS

5. Question submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

| will ask at the next Meeting what is the process for re-establishing a specific
trading market place in the village of Kilfinane.

REPLY:

To allow for a Casual Trading area with temporary market stalls, the
Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock would need to make bye-
laws under The Casual Trading Act,1995.

The purpose of the bye-laws will be to designate a specific area where
licensed casual trading area would be permitted on specific days and
at specific times. The bye-law would also specify the number of casual
trading spaces.

The adoption of Casual Trading Bye-Laws has to be approached with
great sensitivity owing to possible competition with existing established
traders in the vicinity.

Bye-Laws are already in force in Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.

If a permanent structure is being proposed, this would require a
separate planning permission.

6. Question submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell

! will ask at the next Meeting when will works to the road channels and
footpaths in Hospital Town be complete.

REPLY:

This section of the road on Main Street, Hospital, needs to be renewed
properly with macadam, and the Roads Section is seeking quotations
from Contractors at present.

Depending on costs from the quotations, there may not be funds
available to carry out the works this year. If not, the repairs will be
carried out in 2015, subject to available funding.

7. Question submitted by Councillor N. Gleeson

| will ask at the next Meeting about developing a car park in Doon beside the
school and graveyard.

REPLY: Please find attached Drg No. WS 304/D4/01 100. Note that area
marked ‘A' on the map has been transferred into the ownership of
Limerick City and County Council.

The local Community Council is keen that Limerick City & County
Council develop this portion of land into a car park to service the school
and graveyard. Furthermore, this area could also be used to cater for
the overspill of on- street parking outside the convent and shop/petrol
station.

The estimated cost of developing the car park is approximately
€30,000 which is outside the scope of the Roads Programme and so
cannot be funded in 2014.

This work type would be most suitable for 'Development Funding’ and it
is proposed to include it for funding from the Development Fund in
2015.

8. Question submitted by Councillor B. Teefy

! will ask at the next Meeting what is the current situation regarding the
alignment of Beary’s Cross Junction N24.

REPLY: Following discussions between Limerick City & County Council and the
National Roads Authority (NRA), the NRA has agreed to Limerick City
& County Council procuring engineering consultants to progress the
design of junction improvements at N24/R513 Beary’s Cross. This
procurement process will be undertaken by the Road Design Office
and will commence in next few weeks.

NOTICE OF MOTION
9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Donegan

1! will move at the next Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District Meeting that
Limerick City and County Council reinstate a staff member to the Board of
Ballyhoura Development until the alignment process and the role of the Local
Community Development Committee is agreed.

Councillor O' Donnell seconded the Motion.

REPLY:

The Chief Executive Officer has written to the three Local Development
Companies in Limerick advising them that Josephine Cotter Coughlan
is the Council's liaison person for the companies.

The Council has not nominated a staffmemberfor the Local
Development Companies so as to avoid any conflict of interest arising
in the context of the Council becoming the main financial partner for the
implementation of various funding programmes for the Local
Community Development Committee.

It was agreed to receive a Deputation from Lough Gur Development Cooperative
Society Limited at the next Meeting. It was also agreed to hold the next Meeting on
23° October, 2014, in Lough Gur Heritage Centre at 3.30pm.

Councillor Teefy proposed that Mr. Eamon Ryan, Local Enterprise Office, would brief
the Members on the role of the Local Enterprise Office at the November Municipal
District Meeting. This was seconded by Councillor Donegan and agreed.

Councillor Teefy requested a presentation on the role of the Local Community
Development Committee at a future Meeting.

that the Chief Executive must consider the resource needs; where appropriate, the

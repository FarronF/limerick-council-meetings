6. Has the Council addressed the concerns over the frequency of the
transportation of leachate from Gortnadroma dump into the An Curran Estate,

Pallaskenry.

REPLY

Leachate from Gortadroma Landfill was being transported to Pallaskenry
Waste Water Treatment Plant at the rate of two lorry loads per day
(approximately 30 cubic metres per load) for treatment.

The landfill site has now closed for commercial operations. Therefore, the
regular use of the treatment plant will no longer be required. It may be
required on an occasional use basis but this should be on an infrequent or
emergency basis.

7. Has the Council addressed with Irish Water the significant problem of
flooding on Plunkett Road, Askeaton caused by combination of the storm and
foul mains. Will either the Council or Irish Water undertake to address this
problem by separating foul and storm water?

REPLY

The difficulty in this case is caused by the fact that the storm and foul mains
are combined at this location, as they are throughout a large section of
Askeaton. The foul sewer needs to be separated from the storm drains to
alleviate this problem.

It must be noted that the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for the
transfer of water services functions from the county and city councils to Irish
Water with effect from 1* January, 2014.

Section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides the mechanism
for the transfer of the assets, which will be achieved by the designation of a
vesting day or days by Ministerial Order.

The Department is preparing draft Ministerial Orders in this regard and the
objective is that the first of these Orders will be submitted to the Minister for
the Environment, Community and Local Government later this year.

The first Ministerial Order will transfer to Irish Water all pipes, sewers (with
the exception of storm water sewers) and related accessories that are
currently in the ownership of the councils or that are being used by the
councils in the provision of water services.

Any rights and liabilities (including contractual commitments) relating to those
assets will also transfer to Irish Water (this is provided for in section 13 of the
Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013).

Limerick City & County Council is currently preparing an Assets Needs Brief
for submission to Irish Water in relation to the issue at Askeaton.

It will, on receipt of the submission from the Council, be a matter for Irish
Water to consider, prioritise and provide the funding necessary to undertake
the necessary works in accordance with their investment programme and
strategic planning.

8. Can the Council install road markings and proper signage at Kildimo National
School.

REPLY

A discussion took place with Roger McLoughlin of the school Board of
Management on 3 September, 2014 in which the following matters were
discussed:-

(1) Yellow Lines

The school has drawn up a traffic management plan to control traffic
movements in the vicinity of the school gates. This plan involves the
provision of single and double yellow lines over a distance of around 250
metres. Mr. McLoughlin was informed that the Council would be happy to
assist with this work but that there was a statutory procedure to be followed
before the lines could be put down. This procedure required the Council to
consult with the Gardai in advance. The procedure will be initiated
immediately.

(2) Signage

There was a faulty flashing warning sign on the approach from the village
side which was repaired on Tuesday.

(3) Traffic turning movements:

This is obviously a big problem here as it is at most schools due to the
problems caused by parents doing U-turns close to the school gates. It
would be helpful to have an off-road turning area but unfortunately the school
does not have any spare land that could be used for this purpose. There is a
small piece of property available opposite the school that might be suitable
but funding is an issue in this regard. As far as the Senior Executive
Engineer is aware there is no precedent in County Limerick for contributing
financially in these types of situations.

It is intended to meet on site in the near future to discuss the matter further.

Local Government Reform Act 2014

At this point the Cathaoirleach indicated that the remainder of the Meeting would be held
“in committee.”

The Director of Service made a presentation in relation to Local Government Reform Act
2014, with particular emphasis on Reserved Functions and revised budgetary process.
Some discussion followed on the matter.

It was agreed that the next meeting would be held on 7" October, 2014 in Ballyneety Golf
Course at 9:30 a.m. and that a Deputation from Ballyneety Golf Course would be invited to
attend and give a presentation at this meeting.

This concluded the Meeting.

proposed that the N21 would serve as an alternative route for the duration of the road

closure.

It was further stated that it was not envisaged that road L-1316-312 would be closed for
the full 9 month duration sought, rather the successful tenderer would seek to close the
road in question for short intervals during the window sought above.

The report stated that a notice informing the public of the proposed temporary road closure

public until 22" August, 2014.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Collins

10. 1 will ask if a plan for the Monagea Road from Knockane towards the 80 kph
speed limit be drawn up and funding sought for footpaths and lighting.

REPLY A plan and budget to be drawn up, it could be included, for consideration, as
part of the Development Fund for 2015/2016.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

11. (a) | What levels of chlorine are permissible in drinking water under EU
regulation.

(b) Does the application of chlorine volume/frequency affect taste for the
householder.

REPLY (a) EPA Guidance states that there should be at least 0.1 mg/I free
residual chlorine present at the extremities of the distribution network where
residual chlorine levels are likely to be at their lowest. In order to achieve
this, a chlorine dose is required at the treatment plant or chlorine booster
stations are required within the distribution system.

It should also be noted the World Health Organisation requires a minimum
free chlorine concentration of 0.5 mg/I is present after 30 minutes of contact
time between the chlorine dose and the water.

Based on the above LCCC sets a target chlorine dose of 0.5mg /| at most
water treatment plants. A value in excess of 0.5 mg / | may be required at
some plants, in particular where there is a river water source, in order to
ensure the required 0.1 mg/I free residual chlorine at the extremities of the
distribution network

(b) Chlorination by-products causing taste problems can arise as a result
of using chlorine in the production of drinking water. This is mostly a risk
where there is a river water source. This risk is reduced by minimising the
level of chlorine dosing and by ensuring treatment systems are performing to
the required standards.

Detailed information is available in the EPA Water Treatment Manual:
Disinfection which can be downloaded from the EPA website.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will move at the next meeting that urgent and necessary steps be taken by
this Local Authority to stop illegal parking in disability bays.

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, stated that increased penalties, including
penalty points, should be imposed on motorists who illegally parked in disabled
parking bays. He indicated the issue needed to be raised at Government level.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY Local Authorities have powers under Road Traffic Regulations for the general

14.

regulation and control of parking. The Road Traffic Act 1994 gives local
authorities the power to make bye-laws governing the type of parking
controls in their area. Under the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations, local
authorities are responsible for authorizing regulatory traffic signs, including
signage designating disabled parking spaces.

Traffic Wardens and An Garda Siochana are empowered to enforce parking
regulations, including the illegal use of disabled parking bays, in public
places. Unfortunately, these powers of enforcement do not apply in private
places, for example, private car parks.

If there are particular problems relating to illegal parking in disabled parking
bays, these will be brought to the attention of both An Garda Siochana and

the traffic wardens.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

! will move at the September Municipal District Meeting that the footpath at
Churchtown, Newcastle West, be extended to link Cois Teampaill Estate
where currently people accessing here have to walk onto the regional road. It
is highly dangerous.

Councillor Collins, proposed the Motion and the Motion was seconded by Councillor
Scanian.

REPLY This could be included, for consideration, as part of the Development Fund

for 2015/2016. This would also involve land takes.

Mr. P. Vallely, Executive Engineer added that he would discuss the matter with the
land owner.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

15. 1 move that the drinking water supply in Glin be brought to a standard that it
will not be necessary for any user to have to source alternative supply

elsewhere.

Councillor Sheahan, proposed the Motion and it was seconded by Councillor
Scanlan. Members queried if Irish Water would respond. The Director of Service
indicated that the query would be forwarded to Irish Water.

REPLY

The Glin water supply is sourced from a borehole which is situated in close
proximity to a stream and there have been complaints from consumers of
small particles in the water. However, the supply is in compliance with the
Drinking Water Regulations.

It must be noted that responsibility for the provision of water and wastewater
services was transferred to Irish Water with effect from 1* January, 2014
under the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.

Limerick City & County Council has submitted Assets Needs Briefs to Irish
Water in relation to:

(a) The replacement of sections of old cast-iron watermains in the town

and/or
(b) The option of connecting the supply to the Shannon Estuary Water

Supply at Ballyhahill village.

It is now a matter for Irish Water to consider, prioritise and provide the
funding necessary to undertake these works in accordance with their
investment programme and strategic planning.

The Director of Service informed Members of a Public Information Day, organised by
CFRAM, on the risk of flooding in the Dromcollogher Area. The public was invited to a
public consultation day to view and comment on draft flood maps for Dromcollogher. The
maps were part of the Shannon CFRAM Study that would assess flood risk across the
Shannon catchment area and develop Flood Risk Management Plans for those areas
most at risk of flooding. The Public Information Day would take place on Thursday, 11”
September 2014 in Dromcollogher Library.

Members highlighted the issue of overgrown hedges in the County which were causing
problems for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The Members asked that an advertisement
be placed in the local newspapers highlighting the responsibilities of landowners. The
view was expressed that a new approach was needed as the current system was in place
since 1993 and it was not working.

It was suggested that a scheme piloted in Co. Louth regarding hedge-cutting be looked at
and the issue be brought to the full Council.

Members requested that Superintendent be invited to attend a meeting of Municipal
District of Newcastle West.

September, 2014, enclosing Chief Executive’s Report dated 4th September, 2014, in

relation to Mungret Neighbourhood Park, Limerick.

Members stated that, while they were in favour of this proposal in principle, adequate

consultation had not taken place with the Councillors in the area and a second

consultation process had not taken place with the residents, the various interested

groups and the wider community. Some Members were concerned that not all the

questions raised by the submissions on the proposed development were answered

in the report circulated.

On the proposal of Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Byrne, it was

unanimously agreed to defer making a decision on this matter to allow Councillors in

the area to meet with the Planners to discuss the concerns raised and, if necessary,---
to have a second round of consultations with the residents,the various interested

groups and the wider community. A Special Meeting of the Metropolitan District

would then be called and a detailed report on the matter submitted for same.

NOTICES OF MOTION

6.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council start the***

***process of taking in charge the following estates: Curragh Birin and Caislean***

***Na Habhann in Castletroy, Rathlinn in Castleconnell.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Sheahan

(Mayor).

**REPLY:**

These estates have not yet been completed to a satisfactory standard

for taking in charge. The current position with these estates is as

follows:

Curragh Birin, Castletroy – There are current enforcement proceedings

issued for this estate in order to have the outstanding works completed.

Caislean na hAbhann, Castletroy – There were two developers

involved in the construction of this estate, M.A. Ryan & Sons and

Castlelands Construction. Both have requested that their portion of the---
estate be taken in charge. A snag list has been issued to M.A. Ryan &

Sons who are currently working on the snag list. The snag list for the

Castlelands portion of the development is being prepared.

Rathlinn, Castleconnell – This estate is a legacy estate which is

currently being examined with a view to having it taken in charge in its

current condition.

It was requested that a progress report on taking in charge of estates be submitted

to meetings and that consideration be given to taking in charge of Mungret Woods

Estate.

In response to various issues raised by Members, the Senior Planner stated that a

list of estates to be taken in charge and a list of those which had been taken in

charge had been circulated to Members. He agreed to regularly circulate Members

with updates on taking in charge. He informed Members that twenty-seven estates

had been taken in charge within the last two months and staff were working at an

accelerated pace on the matter. He pointed out that there were large costs involved

in taking in charge of estates. A special fund had been set up for estates which were

unfinished and legacy estates were also being taken in charge.

7.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick call on***

***Irish Water to:***

•

***Guarantee all lead pipes in Ballynanty and Kileely, where households***

***have been advised not to consume their tap water due to unacceptably***

***high levels of lead, be removed at no cost to the occupants, where it is***

***in private property or in the houses themselves;***

•

***Provide safe, drinkable bottled water, which does not need to be boiled***

***before it is used, to those affected. This should be available at***

***convenient locations such as shops and community centres. If Irish***

***Water refuse to provide this, the Council must step in and do so;***

•

***Ensure there is a regular supply of this bottled water to those such as***

***the elderly, who, for whatever reason, are unable to collect it***

***themselves. All costs incurred in the delivery of this water should be***

***covered by Irish Water. Again, if Irish Water refuse, the Council should***

***ensure this itself****;*

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor

Quinlivan.

Councillor Byrne suggested that this Motion should be amended calling on Irish

Water to replace the lead pipes throughout Limerick City as soon as possible and not

just in the areas referred to in Councillor Prendiville’s Notice of Motion.

Councillor Collins proposed an amendment which was seconded by Councillor

Hourigan to read as follows:

The Metropolitan District of Limerick move that Irish Water immediately provide safe

drinking water for all its customers in Limerick, residential, commercial and---
agricultural, and that Limerick City and County Council produce a detailed report on

water quality and the location of lead piping.

As all Members were not in agreement, a Vote was taken on the amendment which

resulted as follows:

For the Amendment

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Clifford, Collins, Crowley, Daly, Hourigan, Hurley, Leddin,

Lynch, O’Dea, O’Hanlon, Secas and Sheahan

(14)

Against the Amendment

Councillors Gilligan, Loftus, McCreesh, Ó Ceallaigh, Prendiville and Quinlivan (6)

The Mayor declared the Amendment carried.

**STANDING ORDERS**

As the allotted time for the Meeting had been reached Standing Orders were

suspended for fifteen minutes on the proposal of Councillor Gilligan, seconded by

Councillor Hourigan.

8.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Byrne**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council give***

***consideration to the erection of public lighting on the Caher Road, Mungret,***

***owing to the increase of traffic on this very busy road.***

**REPLY:**

No provision has been made in the Estimate of Expenses for the past

number of years for provision of new public lighting in County Limerick.

Furthermore, the Council’s budget for energy/maintenance of the public

lighting system has been severely eroded in recent years. It is

regretted therefore, that it is not possible to add any additional lights to

the Council’s system at this time other than those governed by

planning commitments. It should be noted also that the Caher Road is

rural rather than urban in nature and therefore would not be a priority

for the installation of public lighting.

Councillor Byrne proposed that a special application for funding be made to the

Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to enable these

lights be erected on Caher Road. This was seconded by Councillor Lynch and

agreed.

9.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Quinlivan**

***I will move at the next meeting of The Metropolitan District that front walls or***

***fencing be provided for a small number of houses on New Road in***

***Thomondgate (including numbers 26 – 38) as a matter of urgency. At the final***

***meeting of the North Ward Area Committee of Limerick City Council it was***

***agreed that the commitment given by a previous Director in 2005 to the***---
***residents of 26 – 38, New Road, Thomondgate, be fulfilled and these***

***gates/fences be provided.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan and seconded by Councillor

McCreesh.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council are aware that commitments were

made to some residents of New Road during the Limerick Main

Drainage Project in relation to alterations that could be provided at the

front of their homes. The issues to be considered with regard to the

provision of these railings include:

Is planning permission required for an alteration to the front of the

houses?

Will the placement of railings close to the windows at the front of the

houses contravene Fire Regulations as the front windows are

considered a means of emergency escape?;

If railings are constructed further out on the footpath, the footpath may

have to be widened out into the roadway, which will have a knock on

effect for parking in front of the houses. Parking may have to be

prohibited on that section of the road if the path is widened out into the

road;

The residents have suggested putting a short chicane in the roadway

at the front of these houses and moving the road towards the site

across the road. This would require a Part 8 and a Road Safety Audit;

No budget has been provided for this work;

**It was agreed to take Item Nos. 10 and 16 together at this point.**

10.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hourigan**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council take***

***immediate steps to repair the river bank from St. Michael’s Boat Club to***

***Barrington’s Pier before winter.***

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Crowley**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council carry out***

***immediate repairs to the riverbank from St. Michael’s Boat Club to***

***Barrington’s Pier and that the sandbags used during the storms be removed***

***forthwith.***

The Motions were proposed and seconded by Councillors Hourigan and Crowley.

**REPLY:**

Further to the flooding of January and February, 2014 that overtopped

sections of the Condell Road Embankment leading to flooding along

the Condell Road requiring its closure, Limerick City and County

Council made an application to Government for funding to carry out

extensive repairs and increase the height of the flood embankment. To

date no response to this application for funding has been received from

Government.---
Limerick City and County Council has carried out repairs to damaged

sections of the embankment using sandbags to stabilise this

embankment. It would not be prudent to remove the sandbags until the

permanent repairs and upgrade to the embankment are completed.

It is envisaged that significant works will be carried out to the Condell

Road embankment to both raise its level and strengthen it and it is

hoped Government will make a decision on funding soon so that works

can be advanced.

11.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hourigan**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council take in***

***charge the whole of Ashbrook Estate, Ennis Road and Silverbrook, Mill Road,***

***Corbally, Limerick.***

In moving the Motion, Councillor Hourigan indicated that the taking in charge issues

had already been discussed under previous Motion Item No. 6.

**REPLY :**

These estates have not yet been completed to a satisfactory standard

for taking in charge. The current position with these estates is as

follows :

Ashbrook Estate, Ennis Road – Ashbrook, Ashbrook Park and Grove

have been taken in charge. We have been engaging with the

developer to complete the remaining portions of Ashbrook Crescent,

Lawn and Gardens with no success. At this stage we are currently

examining these estates with a view to having them taken in charge in

their current condition.

Silverbrook, Mill Road, Corbally – We have engaged with the developer

of this estate in order to have the outstanding works completed. We

now intend to claim the bond lodged as security for the completion of

this estate.

12.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council consider***

***the introduction of the first hour free parking in the city centre to facilitate***

***greater footfall into the core city centre area.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Daly.

13.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Byrne**

***I will move at the next meeting that in relation to parking Limerick City and***

***County Council consider***

•

***Turning loading bays, where possible, into parking spaces after 12 noon***

***each day;***---
•

***Where possible that vacant buildings due to be demolished be cleared***

***to create more on street car parking;***

•

***That agreement be entered into with NAMA on the Ballinacurra site to***

***clear the site and create temporary parking coming up to Christmas;***

•

***That the first half hour of all parking be free;***

•

***That we learn from the park and ride system in operation for the visit of***

***the giant and investigate if some agreement could be put in place on a***

***trial basis with these parking sites between now and Christmas;***

•

***That we operate a park and ride system especially Thursdays, Fridays***

***and Saturdays;***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

In response to both Motions Nos. 12 and 13, the Meetings Administrator read the

following portion of prepared reply and agreed to circulate the replies to both

Motions.

**REPLY:**

Free Parking

In response to the items raised in the Notices of Motion by the

Members in relation to providing free parking for 1 hour or 30 minutes

at the start of each parking transaction it is recommended that this

issue of Parking Policy should be an early item for consideration by the

new Specific Policy Committee (SPC) on Transport and that the current

policy on parking charges be reviewed and a new policy developed, if

required.

As noted above the vast majority of car parking in the city centre is

provided in off street car parks and on street car parking occupancy is

running at close to 100%. There is not really an issue with getting

people to use on street parking. The bigger issue is that it is a limited

resource. Private car parking charges are much higher than on street

and this also needs to be addressed as part of the solution to the

matters raised by the Councillors.

The Members should also be aware that income from parking is used

to run the traffic light system, provide new road markings and signs,

provide school wardens as well as improvement and maintenance of

city centre streets. Any loss of parking revenue by providing free

parking on-street will result in a loss of revenue for these essential

services and this revenue will have to be found from other sources.

The roads budget was significantly reduced in the 2013 annual budget

and has resulted in 2014 being a difficult year for responding to the

demands from the public for road repairs. No provision has been made

in the 2014 Annual Budget for a reduction in parking charges.

Loading Bays

Limerick City and County Council is supportive of the proposals to

change some loading bays into parking bays after 12 p.m. each day.

These changes will need the support and agreement of the business

community, many of whom continue to get deliveries well into the---
afternoon, so each loading bay will have to be looked at on a business

by business basis. Limerick City and County Council has commenced

the examination of the traffic management and legal implications of this

proposal and will revert to a later meeting with our findings.

NAMA and Vacant Sites

This request has been referred to the Economic Development

Department who are responsible for the Council’s Property Portfolio

and are the Department who liaise with representatives of NAMA in

relation to derelict sites.

Park and Ride

Limerick City and County Council are happy to explore Park and Ride

Services coming up to Christmas. It is most likely that this will have to

be done with a commercial Bus and Car Park Operator as again no

provision has been made in the 2014 budget to operate Park and Ride.

The Park and Ride for the Royal De Luxe Giant operated very well and

proved that for the right events Park and Ride can prove a popular

alternative to driving into the city centre.

Members asked that parking in outlying areas be looked at also e.g. Annacotty and

that the public would be kept informed in relation to parking.

In reply to a query, the Senior Engineer agreed to look at putting additional lights in

Arthurs Quay Park.

**STANDING ORDERS**

At this point, Standing Orders were again suspended for ten minutes on the

proposition of Councillor Hourigan, seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.

14.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council***

***immediately restore the life buoys/rings at each of our three main bridges,***

***Shannon, Thomond and Sarsfield Bridges and also to investigate the***

***possibility of introducing bye-laws or other measures governing these life***

***buoys/rings, to ensure that those who steal, damage or interfere with the life***

***buoys/rings would be punished severely.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Lynch and seconded by Cllr. McCreesh.

**REPLY:**

There are currently 59 lifebuoys located around Limerick Metropolitan

area. A number of these are located close to Shannon, Sarsfield and

Thomond Bridges.

Shannon Bridge

The nearest lifebuoys are located on the southside of the river, along

the quay wall, near the skateboard park up to the Clarion Hotel (4

lifebuoys) and at the Seaman’s Memorial Park (1 lifebuoy in the park).---
There have been numerous emergency calls to the river for rescues at

Shannon Bridge and rescue equipment would be of benefit at suitable

locations on this bridge.

Sarsfield Bridge

The nearest lifebuoys are located on Clancy Strand and O’Callaghan

Strand less than a few meters from the traffic lights on either side of the

strands. There have also been numerous emergency calls to the river

for rescues at Sarsfield Bridge and rescue equipment would be of

benefit at suitable locations on this bridge.

Thomond Bridge

The nearest lifebuoys are located (looking down river) to the left of

Thomond Bridge next to King John’s Castle and to the right, beside the

Treaty Stone. There is also a lifebuoy located (looking up river) about

50m to the right heading towards Verdant Place, St. Mary’s Park.

Rescue equipment would be of benefit at suitable locations on this

bridge.

Accordingly, a report will be prepared about placing rescue equipment

on Shannon, Thomond and Sarsfield Bridges and advising if it would

be possible to place equipment on these bridges.

Introducing Bye Laws or other measures governing these life

buoys/rings

Limerick City and County Council is aware that under Section 2 of the

Criminal Damage Act 1991, significant penalties are available to the

Courts where malicious damage to property is proved. Similarly, if

lifesaving equipment is stolen it can be dealt with by due process of

law.

Damage to lifesaving equipment is to be abhorred; it is not putting it too

strongly to say that anyone who damages lifesaving equipment shows

a callous disregard for human life. Against this background, Limerick

City and County Council should instigate proceedings against any

person where evidence is available that he/she was responsible for

causing such damage or theft.

The Meetings Administrator agreed to circulate a copy of the Reply to Members.

15.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Loftus**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick write***

***to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Charlie Flanagan, T.D., calling for the***

***Irish Government to:***

•

***Register it’s opposition to the gross violation of human rights by Israel***

***by expelling the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland;***

•

***Campaign for international sanctions and an arms trade embargo on***

***Israel;***---
•

***Demand the immediate end to the blockade and siege of Gaza and***

***withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Palestinian territories and a***

***reversing of the decision by the Israeli government to seize Palestinian***

***land and build new settlements;***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Loftus and seconded by Councillor

Prendiville.

Councillor Hourigan proposed an Amendment to the Notice of Motion which was

seconded by Councillor Butler as follows:

I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council would register

its opposition to gross violation of human rights by Israel in Gaza but would

acknowledge the role of the Israeli Ambassador as a vital channel of two way

communication in times of crisis.

As all Members were not in agreement a Vote was taken which resulted as follows:

For the Amendment

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Clifford, Crowley, Daly, Hourigan, Hurley, Leddin, Lynch,

O’Dea, O’Hanlon, Secas and Sheahan (13)

Against the Amendment

Councillors Gilligan, Loftus, McCreesh, Ó Ceallaigh, Prendiville and Quinlivan (6)

The Mayor declared the Amendment carried.

This concluded the Meeting.

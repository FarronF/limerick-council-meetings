Limerick
CITY & COUNTY

COUNCIL

2™ October, 2014.

To/ The Mayor and each Member of the Metropolitan District of Limerick

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with various issues in relation to Municipal
Districts. One of the main items dealt with in the Act includes the General Municipal
Allocation (GMA) which is the discretionary funding which is made available to municipal
district members contained in the draft budgetary plan. Once the local authority has adopted
its budget for 2015, a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and repair to be carried
out will be prepared for each municipal district. Once finalised this schedule of works will

also be considered by the Members.

The Act requires that the Chief Executive, in determining the resources to be made available
to each municipal district in the draft budgetary plan, shall have regard to;

(i) The needs of and the resources available or likely to be available to the local

authority and
(ii) Resource needs of each municipal district including, where feasible, the population of

each municipal district.

The Act further provides that the draft budgetary plan shall set out the General
Municipal Allocation and shall be considered by the municipal district at a meeting
which concludes no later than 21 days prior to the local authority budget meeting.

The Act further provides that the municipal district Members shall, by resolution,
adopt the draft budgetary plan with or without amendment and that the Chief
Executive shall take account of any budgetary plan adopted by the district Members.

As at the 30" September the Council resolved to reduce the base rate for the Local
Property Tax by 3% for 2015. The overall objective, in compiling the 2015 budget, is
to ensure a satisfactory level of service for the citizen. As you are aware, Limerick
City and County Council's budget is made up of a high volume of non discretionary
expenditure. The starting point for the consideration of the GMA allocations included
reviewing the levels of discretionary allocations in 2014 budget.

Section 102 (4A) (c) and (d) provide that it is a reserved function of the Members of a
municipal district to adopt the draft budgetary plan with or without amendment.

For 2015 the main, strategic, non-discretionary expenditure of Limerick City and
County Council will form part of the main local authority budget. Included in this is
expenditure on Housing Maintenance, Roads Grants and own funding, libraries, fire
services and all staff costs associated with the municipal districts.

The total provisional allocation for General Municipal Allocation for 2015 is
€1,500,000. As part of the allocation it is proposed that a figure will be provided in
each district for special projects. These projects must specify a minimum spend of
€50,000 each and it is envisaged that this spend will be for projects of a specific and
strategic nature. The total amount allocated for special projects in each of the
municipal districts is €100,000 with €150,000 to be provided for the metropolitan
area. Please be advised that funds stated below form part of the overall allocation of

the budget spend similar to previous years.

Tom Gilligan,
Head of Finance.

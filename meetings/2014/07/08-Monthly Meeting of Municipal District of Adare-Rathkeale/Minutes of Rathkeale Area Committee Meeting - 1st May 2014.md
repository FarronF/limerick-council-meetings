meeting adding that the matter had been brought to his attention

while canvassing in the Pallaskenry area.

Councillor Sheahan (K) went on to say that sludge was being drawn

in to the private estate by Limerick County Council and this was not

acceptable especially when people were paying property tax and had

to contend with obnoxious smells while this process was going on.

Councillor Sheahan (K) also asked if this sewerage plant had been

checked and if it had met with EPA standards.

Kieran O’Gorman, S.E.E. told members that the Council has to

dispose of excess lechate at Gortadroma Landfill from time to time

due to limited capacity in the County & also at the Landfill and for this

reason the Pallaskenry sewerage treatment plant was chosen

because of its accessibility & proximity from Gortadroma.

sewerage plant were very good and the arrangement was working

very well.

lechate into the Pallaskenry estate and added that he had received---
several representations from the developer of this particular estate

which is not in the charge of Limerick County Council expressing

serious concern at the road surface due to this heavy traffic using the

estate to access the sewerage plant.

KOG SEE agreed to examine alternative sewerage treatment plants

and to have the road condition checked at the location and added

that the use of the Pallaskenry Plant for lechate disposal will reduce

with the closure of the landfill at Gortadroma.

Item 3 – Update Gortadroma Landfill.

The Gortadroma landfill Monitoring report & update was circulated to

members advising the landfill had closed to commercial customers on

the 14th of April 2014 however Gortadroma Landfill will continue to

accept household waste form private householders for the

foreseeable future. It was also advised the landfill will be manned to

ensure the EPA agencys’ licence conditions are fulfilled and it is

expected the licence will remain in place for the next thirty years.

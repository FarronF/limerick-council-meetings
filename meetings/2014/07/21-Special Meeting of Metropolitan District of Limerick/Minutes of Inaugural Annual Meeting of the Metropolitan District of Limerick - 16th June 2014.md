The Deputy Chief Executive declared Councillor Michael Sheahan elected as Mayor of

The Metropolitan District of Limerick and congratulated him on his election.

The Mayor welcomed everybody to the Meeting of the newly created Metropolitan District

of Limerick. He extended thanks and appreciation to his family, friends, the Fine Gael

organisation, the electorate of Limerick City East and his Fine Gael and Fianna Fail

colleagues who unanimously supported him for the office of Mayor.

He said the redefining of the city, its environs and immediate hinterland had resulted in the

creation of a new political, economic, educational and social unit. He said, as Mayor, he

would facilitate, encourage and nurture all creative and positive ideas while at the same

time encourage and assist individuals, communities and community based organisations

to take those extra steps towards personal and community enhancement. He said he

proposed to meet with all political groupings represented in the Chamber to discuss local

matters of concern, if they so wished and that he would meet with party leaders in advance

of monthly meetings.

The Mayor referred to the many women of distinction and achievement in Limerick and in

particular paid tribute to former Mayor of Limerick, Kathleen Leddin for carrying out her

functions with dignity and diligence. He paid tribute to all involved in the Special Olympics

at the University of Limerick where disability was put in the shade and the true person

shone out in the shape of the 1500 athletes who were unselfishly supported by over 3000

volunteers, families and friends.

Members wished the Mayor every success in the coming year in the office of Mayor and

said they were looking forward to working with him for the good of Limerick. They paid

tribute to former Mayor Kathleen Leddin who did an excellent job as Mayor. Members said

that this was a new chapter for Limerick and there would be huge challenges in the years

ahead and, therefore, it was important that all Members worked together for the betterment

of Limerick and its environs.

It was proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon and seconded by Councillor Hourigan that the

wearing of robes at ceremonial occasions would be allowable if Members wished to do so.

The view was expressed that this matter should be discussed at a Party Leaders Meeting.

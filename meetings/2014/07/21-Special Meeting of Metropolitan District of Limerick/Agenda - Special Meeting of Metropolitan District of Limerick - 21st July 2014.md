Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin

I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council

establish an emergency fund to enable basic essential maintenance work

to be done on those housing estates currently not taken in charge by council.

5.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors M. Quinlivan,

S. Ó Ceallaigh and M. McCreesh

We will move at the next meeting that we agree to hold council meetings in

community centres across the city on a regular basis. At least once a year

the Metropolitan District of Limerick will hold a meeting in community centres

in areas such as Southill, Caherdavin, Castleconnell or Moyross. As a newly

constituted local authority, we should demonstrate the importance of the

community voice and of an open and transparent decision making process.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler

I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council

supports the introduction of bye-laws or other measures which would ensure

that circuses which use animals are prohibited from performing in any part of

the local authority area in light of the well documented evidence of suffering

endured by the animals involved and the serious animal welfare issued

raised.

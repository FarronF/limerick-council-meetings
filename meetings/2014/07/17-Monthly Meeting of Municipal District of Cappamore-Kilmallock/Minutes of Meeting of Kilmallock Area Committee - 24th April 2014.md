and comparison with the same period in 2013.

Though there are increases in some forms of crime, the marked decrease in public

order and criminal damage offences can be attributed to the change in rosters within

the area.

Council and the N.R.A. for facilitating the “Go Safe” van at O’Rourke’s Cross on the

status of Grange Bridge following an enquiry from Cllr. Houlihan.

Cllr. Ryan noted the progress on Galbally footpaths, and the cooperation of Irish

Water’s metering work with the project.

Cllr. O’Donnell noted that meters have been installed at points where no current

public mains connection exists, and hoped that any disconnections requested would be

free of charge.

B. Murphy stated that Irish Water’s policy nationally on disconnections is yet to be

clarified but the Council will continue to liaise through B. Noonan. The members can

avail of the dedicated Councillor’s line to Irish Water’s Customer Liaison Centre.

Thomas J. Kelly, Executive Engineer in the Roads section is dealing with any

difficulties arising during the metering programme.

**Update on Kilmallock Waste Water Treatment Plant. ( Cllr. Donegan)**

B. Murphy informed the meeting that the new Kilmallock Waste Water Treatment

Plant is now operational. This is a Design, Build and Operate scheme, constructed by

Coffey Construction, and operated by Coffey Water.

The demolition of the old plant is ongoing, and the existing package plant at Glenfield

is to be removed shortly. Imported sewage sludge from neighbouring small schemes

is also being treated at the new plant. Reinstatement works at Glenfield have been

agreed, and will proceed over the next 4 weeks.

The members welcomed the new facility and thanked Barry Murphy for his update.

**Report on unfinished estates and Special Resolution Fund (Cllr. Donegan)**

Circulated – Table outlining current position regarding unfinished estates in

Kilmallock area.

G. O’Connor informed the committee that, since his last update in December 2013,

works on The Hawthorns, Ballyagran have been completed, and the process of taking

the estate in charge has commenced. Works have commenced at Glen Grove,

Charleville Road, Kilmallock. Under the Special Resolution Fund, the Planning

section have applied for funding for two estates in the Kilmallock area.

A total of 6 unfinished estates are now complete, and following the completion of

works at Glen Grove, the Bellview Estate in Glenfield, Kilmallock is next to be

resolved.

Cllr. Donegan asked whether it is planned to reduce the height of the green area in

Glen Grove, as it is impeding sight lines, and parents’ view of children at play.

Mr. O’Connor stated that there are no plans presently to do this, as it is not a

condition of Planning. It can be included if funding is made available.

The members thanked Mr. O’Connor for his briefing.
---
**Discuss road repairs and signage for upcoming bike championship event in**

**Kilfinane- Ballyhoura (Cllr. Houlihan)**

Cllr Houlihan requested that, as an international bike racing championship comes to

the Ballyhoura area in June of 2014, it would be beneficial if the Council could carry

out some road repairs in the area, and also replace some missing road signs. It is an

ideal opportunity to portray the area in the best possible light.

Cllr. Ryan supported this proposal, and also highlighted hedges protruding out over

the road surface in many of these rural roads.

The other members supported the request, and the chairman stated that it is hoped

that this event will attract up to 10,000 visitors to the region in mid June.

S. Nash, Roads Engineer stated that he has already spoken to Ardpatrick Tidy Towns

and will liaise with Ballyhoura Development on this and other events planned for the

area over the summer.

Following a brief discussion the members thanked Mr. Nash for his assistance in

facilitating these important gatherings.

**Update on Kilmallock Area Road Works Scheme 2014.(Cllr. O’Donnell)**

S. Nash informed the meeting that the reconstruction of County Roads in the area has

commenced. Rathcannon, Athlacca and Glenbevan, Croom are under reconstruction

presently and Garryfine is due to commence next week.

Development Fund works at Galbally and Glenbrohane are still ongoing in the east of

the area.

He confirmed that the overlay on the main street in Kilmallock will take place during

the Summer.

In discussing cycle races on public roads, members felt that these are often held at

very short notice, and organisers do not always have regard to the condition of the

road surface in deciding routes.

**Any other business.**

Members expressed dissatisfaction with the very condensed time period allowed for

the submission of applications for the Community Involvement Scheme for works on

public roads. The Roads Engineer has been given very little time to properly assess

proposals.

S. Nash, Roads Engineer, informed the members that he is meeting specialist

contractors within the next week with a view to erecting safety barriers at Garrienderk

Bridge .

In conclusion, the members spoke of the significance of this occasion, the final

meeting of Kilmallock Area Committee of Limerick County Council.

They thanked the chairman and congratulated him on his excellent tenure.

Chairman David Moloney thanked the members for their kind works, and addressed

the committee.

**Chairman’s address to the Committee :**

Since being co-opted as a Councillor onto Limerick County Council in place of

Senator James Heffernan in Sept 2011, and at that time having just turned 24 years of

age, I have certainly learned a great amount about local government and democracy.

- It has been a privilege and an honour for me to serve on Limerick County Council as

a Labour Party Councillor. During my time I have endeavoured to serve my family,

my hometown of Kilfinane, the Kilmallock electoral area and my county with

distinction and to the best of my ability.

- In the last almost 3 years I have met a great number of people, in our communities

and on the reserved and executive side of the Council for whom I have great respect

and admiration. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who I have been in

contact with and who has been in contact with me and especially those people who

helped me with the many issues and challenges that I have encountered in my time as

a councillor.

- Today is indeed a very historic day, 115 years in the waiting. It is the last area

meeting of this group of councillors and management and also the last area meeting of

the Kilmallock area committee before the amalgamation process is fully realised.

- I am extremely proud to have chaired the area in this it's final year. I think that I may

be one of the youngest councillors to do so and for that I am very grateful. In the last

term we have been active in inviting community groups and organisations to make

presentations about the work that they undertake and their plans for the future. We

received deputations from St Joseph's Foundation, Charleville, Kilmallock Tidy

Towns and Elton Tidy Towns Association.

- In planning, a new burial ground has been secured for Kilmallock after a long time

searching for a suitable site.

- Late last year many houses in the area benefitted from the Energy Retrofitting

Project undertaken by this area office and some key stakeholders. Many residents of

the area have noted a marked difference in terms of their homes energy efficiency

which is certainly something to be welcomed.

- I think that it extremely important to be cognisant of the storms that dominated

much of the area's and indeed Council's work in early February. I want to take this

opportunity again to pay tribute to the mammoth effort that was made by both indoor

and outdoor staff at that time. It was no mean feat and certainly worthy of special

mention.

- Another aspect of my own term and our last term as an area committee was the

increase in the Development Fund for the area from €30,000 in previous years to

€100,000 for this year. This is a very welcome increase in allocation and I believe that

the projects that it is to be put toward will make significant contributions to the area.

- At the beginning of this year we have seen a milestone both nationally and a local

level with the transfer of assets to Irish water. Progress is underway in this respect as
---
homes all over the area and county have or are getting water meters fitted.

- Also in water, let us not forget the outstanding Chambers Ireland Award that the

Kilmallock Water Treatment plant won during this year amongst very stiff

competition from other much more highly funded Treatment centres all over the

country. This was a fantastic achievement to add to the ISO award that the treatment

centre had already won, the first of its kind in Ireland. This deserves special mention

and I am glad to be associated with it.

- In the new amalgamated Council, all areas including the Kilmallock-Cappamore

area will realise the new electoral boundary changes. It is probably being realised

already by many of the councillors and canvassing teams. The new area should have

greater direct responsibility and influence at a local level. I hope that this new

structure will carry out its business in the same just manner that I believe this

committee has tried to conduct its business.

- I would like to pay tribute to each individual elected member and member of staff

past and present who has served the Kilmallock area with distinction. I am in awe of

the level of commitment and sheer dedication of all of these men and women. It has

been an honour to serve the people of County Limerick and the Kilmallock area

alongside them. We have seen a number of changes in personnel in the last few years

with Ben Noonan and John Madden moving on to "greener pastures" and we now

have our Water Services and Travel and Transportation in the capable hands of Barry

Murphy and Sean Nash respectively. Ger O'Connor came in as Senior Executive

Engineer a number of years ago also and I have been fortunate to witness the huge

level of professionalism that he has brought with him.

- I think that it would be remiss of me on this historic occasion that is tinged with

sadness at the passing of the husband of one of our great colleagues, not to

acknowledge and commemorate all those near and dear to everyone in this area office

who have passed on in the last year and indeed during this last term of Limerick

County Council. May they all find peace and repose in their place of rest.

- To conclude I want to reiterate that it has been a privilege for me to serve and work

on Limerick County Council alongside each of the members, each of the directors,

officials and staff. It would take too long to mention everyone but I think you will all

forgive me for singling out my appreciation for Willie Ryan who has at times been

like a second pair of hands to me and someone on whom I could always call. With the

upcoming amalgamation nigh I want to reaffirm my hope that the county portion of

Limerick keeps pace and is given the same consideration and credence as our City

neighbours in the new authority. With that I want to wish all of the returning and new

candidates the very best of luck in the elections. Go raibh mìle maith agaibh."

END

The meeting then concluded.

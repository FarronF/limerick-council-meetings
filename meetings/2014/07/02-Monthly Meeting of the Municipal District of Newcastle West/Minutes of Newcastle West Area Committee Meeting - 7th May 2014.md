Questions
Questions submitted by Councillor Scanlan:

(i) “| will ask at the next area meeting as to what is being done to remove
the trees lying to the west of Castleview Estate as these are a very
significant danger to children within the area”.

It was noted that the fallen trees had been removed. Cllr. Reidy also stated
that he had spoken to Filterteck and they are in favour of replacing the trees
which fell. It was agreed that the Horticultural Section would be contacted
with regard to this matter.

(ii) “I will ask at the next area meeting that signage be provided at
Sycamore Crescent, Oakpark Estate, to alert drivers that children play
within the area also, that the provision of speed ramps be considered for
both areas”.

Discussion took place on the estates and it was noted that there is no funding
available for speed ramps. P. Crowe also noted that a traffic calming policy
had been drawn up and the installation of ramps was at the lower end of traffic
calming recommendations. It was also advised that speed ramps had not been
successful in some estates as there are issues with noise and location. However
both estates would be checked for suitable locations for the erection of
signage.

exist in respect of bridges at Carraward West, Clonmore, Evegallahoo

investigation had been carried out on extinguishing this right of way. The

the proposal. Discussion also took place on out of order public lighting in the
area and this matter is to be followed up with Airtricity. Public lighting at St.

QUESTION FROM SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL DISTRICT MEETING

6. Question submitted by Councillor F. Foley

1 will ask at the next Meeting for a copy of the planning permission and a copy of the
Environmental impact Statement from Irish Water with regard to the works which they
carried out on the River Feale, Abbeyfeale at McCarthy’s bend with regard to diverting
water to the Abbeyfeale Water Treatment Plant.

REPLY:

e In early 2016, following extreme floods, a breach formed on the River Feale. The
breach occurred when flood waters bypassed the existing meander, the natural course
of the river and instead flowed through an existing drainage channel. If left unchecked
this would have caused the meander to become cut off from the river. This could have
resulted in a significant threat to the water supply for approximately 3,000 people
supplied by the Abbeyfeale Public Water Supply.

e The River Feale is the raw water source for the Abbeyfeale Public Water Supply and
the raw water intake (abstraction point) was in place long before the 2016 event.

e Due to concerns by Irish Water and Limerick County Council that the breach may
impact adversely on the abstraction, emergency works were planned and undertaken.
The works involved closing of the breach channel during low flows and undertaking
some instream works on the main river channel at the request of Inland Fisheries
Ireland,

e Prior to and during the works, Irish Water and Limerick County Council consulted with
the OPW, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFl) and the National Parks and Wildlife Service
(NPWS) and complied fully with all associated requirements. It was confirmed that
there was no requirement to complete a Natura Impact Statement (NIS). An
Appropriate Assessment Screening Report was prepared and submitted to NPWS. This
report is attached.

e The works were completed later in 2016.

e trish Water contends that the works undertaken did not change the course of the River
Feale but rather restored and protected its natural channel flow to that of the river,
pre 2016. While it is accepted that there has been erosion at the Public Park, Irish
Water's position is that this did not occur as a result of the emergency works
undertaken.

e trish Water does not have jurisdiction to undertake any further works on the River
Feale and so it is respectfully suggested that contact be made with the OPW to further
discuss the matter,

Please accept our apologies for the delay in responding to your query as we worked to
compile the information above. Should you or your colleagues have any additional
queries, you may direct them to the Local Representative Support Desk and we will make
every effort to respond as quickly as possible, The LRSD can be contacted by email at
localrepsupport @water.ie or by phone at 1890 178 178.

Councillor Foley acknowledged the response received from Irish Water but also referred
to the ongoing issue with regard to river erosion at the town park.

QUESTIONS

for the Cryleview entrance and an update on the sewerage issues in this estate in

drawings for the full project and a report on the housing development for Colbert Terrace
(c) an update on the proposed housing development for Mountcollins (d) an update on
the new graveyard for Abbeyfeale.

REPLY:

(a)

Central Services submitted a feasibility report previously for junction improvements at
Cryle View to Til. Til have reviewed this report and have indicated that funding may be
made available in 2021.

Limerick City and County Council Water Services monitor the sewer network and one
particular sewer manhole at Cryle View regularly given the tendency for blockages at that
manhole location. The manhole is checked twice weekly and cleaned/sucked out as required
with the sewer connection to the Killarney Road mainline also jetted as required. The
frequency of this operation varies and would be more frequent in wet weather (hence the
resident observing our jetting contractor being there more frequently in the past while).

LCCC’s investigation of this issue concluded that remedial works were required to manhole to
mitigate the blockages and need for repeated jetting/cleaning out. A proposal was sent to

6

Irish Water for approval and recently a purchase order has been issued to a Contractor to

! will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the Limerick City and County Council’s
Camera system in Abbeyfeale as there was a problem with them and has it been fixed.

REPLY:

We have reviewed footage for Abbeyfeale and have found the following:

These cameras include panoramic cameras, which are a collection of cameras reviewing a 360
degree aspect.

We are aware of some issues with ANPR cameras and are working with the supplier to resolve
these however these cameras are not going to capture everything as they are specifically
designed for a narrow window and perfect lighting. They will function within certain
parameters and tolerances but not 100%. We are at present working to achieve maximum
results possible within the environment where ANPR are deployed.

Councillor Foley referred to camera system in Abbeyfeale where the Gardai are having
difficulty with the quality of the footage. Following a brief discussion by the Members it was
agreed that this matter would be raised again with the relevant Directorate.

Authority be undertaken immediately once property purchased, in order that those homes
are tenanted within a 6 month timeframe from the date of purchase.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council clearly mark out and
define the trading area at the Square, Newcastle West to identify how many pitches are
available there.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.
REPLY:

As per the Council Casual Trading Bye Laws 1996, casual trading is permitted to take place at
the Square, Newcastle West on Thursdays and Saturdays.

All traders who wish to trade at the Square, Newcastle West, which is the designated trading
area as per the Bye-Laws, will require a licence. Licences are issued by the Council on receipt
of completed application form along with evidence of the necessary public liability insurance
and licence fee.

Once licenced, the trader is designated a space if there is one available. There are currently
seven licenced traders at the Square and these take up of most of the casual trading area -
The trading areas have not been marked/painted out on the ground as this would take from
the appearance of the cobbled area at the Square on non-trading days. However each trader
is advised of their space on recipt of a licence.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins requested that Limerick City and County Council
clearly mark out and define the trading area at the Square, Newcastle West. A brief discussion
followed and it was agreed that a list of traders and map would be circulated.

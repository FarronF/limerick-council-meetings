**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council approved the application for loan sanction in the

amount of €15m for the Planned Maintenance Loan from the Minister for Housing,

Planning and Local Government at the Council Meeting held on 25th November,

2019.

Application for Departmental Sanction in the amount of €10m was made on 29th

May, 2020 by Limerick City and County Council. The Council is awaiting this

Departmental Sanction.

In line with our SPC workshops and meetings, Limerick City and County Council are

working to maximise the impact of the loan monies by using same to leverage

funding from other sources.

During 2020, loan monies will be combined with the grant funding to cover the cost

of our Energy Efficiency programme, which will see energy efficiency improvements

carried out on 120 of our houses throughout the city and county. In addition to

setting up a planned maintenance programme for our housing stock, the loan

finance will be used for future projects under the Energy Efficiency scheme – an

update on this particular project will be provided at our next Housing SPC.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

on site in mid-2021.

lodged by end of the year. The scheme is scheduled to commence in 2022.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next meeting have Limerick City and County Council received communication from***

***Bus Eireann regarding an additional bus stop on Childers Road to facilitate people from Kennedy***

***Park and Glasgow Park on the existing bus route 329 to Georgian Village.*** ***The NTA have asked***

***Bus Eireann to liaise with Limerick City and County Council to ascertain any infrastructural***

***requirements that would be required to facilitate Route 329 stopping additionally on Childers***

***Road.*** ***Have the Council responded to this communication and was it favourable.***

**REPLY**:

The Council has been contacted by Bus Éireann regarding the above route. An initial

examination of a potential site for locating a bus stop was carried out. Its findings

were that while there would be space to accommodate a bus stop on the Kennedy

Park side of the Childers’ Road, situating a bus stop on the opposite side would not

currently be practical on safety grounds.

Bus Éireann has indicated that at present an additional bus stop is not warranted at

this location on usage grounds.

**REPLY:**

the warrants are met for the provision of a controlled pedestrian  crossing on the

Church Road in Ballybrown to the side entrance of the church.

The provision of a new footpath outside the boundary wall of the church extending

to the school can be examined but would likely require landtake from the church

carpark and as such an agreement to set back the boundary wall.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Limerick Metropolitan District that Limerick City and County***

***Council complete draft plans to provide a safe and suitable walkway from Hayes Shop,***

benefit to users of the Club and residents in the area.

The proposal submitted is for a rural location along the local primary road from

Ballybrown school towards Mungret. The scheme proposed can be investigated,

costed and would most likely involve the provision of public lighting, surface water

drainage, land purchase and agreed accommodation works, etc.

would revert to Members at a subsequent Local Electoral Area Briefing or Metropolitan Meeting.

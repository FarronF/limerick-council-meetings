QUESTIONS

6. Question submitted by Councillor Michael Donegan

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock if the Office
of Public Works have carried out or plan to carry out maintenance on the streams and rivers
in the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District following the recent flooding.

Reply:
The following reply was received from the Office of Public Works (OPW) dated 13" October,
2020:

The OPW undertakes maintenance to Arterial Drainage Schemes through a programme of
works on a 5-year cycle. The Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District incorporates a number
of Arterial Drainage Schemes including the Groody Scheme, the Mulkear-Ballymackeogh
Scheme, the River Maigue Scheme and the Mulkear-Cappamore Flood Relief Scheme. The
extents of these Schemes and the channels, which come under the auspices of the OPW for
maintenance, can be viewed at www. floodinfo.ie.

In relation to the River Maigue Arterial Drainage Scheme in Kilmallock, the OPW can confirm
that maintenance to a large number of channels in the Kilmallock area had been undertaken
both in 2019 and previously in 2015. This is in addition to occasional call outs responding to
fallen trees or gathered debris at structures that could pose a flood risk.

The OPW operates a hydrometric gauge upstream of Kilmallock at Riversfield Weir. On August
17" 2020, water levels were recorded far in excess of anything previously experienced at this
gauge. When the recorded levels are analysed against rating curves calibrated to model flood
events for the OPW’s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study
there are indications that the August 17th event was an extreme flood event with an expected
return period greater than 100 years.

The Arterial Drainage Scheme was constructed to improve drainage in the river catchment to
enhance agricultural output, and whilst it mitigates against flooding to lands and property for
smaller flood events, the works undertaken were not designed to protect lands and property
from flood events such as this, which are expected to occur on a less frequent basis.

Following the flood event, the OPW has been undertaking maintenance works in the
Kilmallock area to ensure that channels and structures remain clear of any debris or build-up
of silts and gravels, which may have occurred during the extreme flows and water levels that
were experienced.

The OPW provides funding to loca! authorities through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and
Coastal Protection Scheme and there are a number of areas being examined where flooding
could be mitigated through works under this scheme. The Office of Public Works will continue
to liaise with Limerick City and County Council in this respect.

7. Question submitted by Councillor Martin Ryan

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for a
progress update report on the R513 in response to Notice of Motion submitted previously at
the June 2020 Meeting where | asked that Limerick City and County Council and the
Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport review the heavy traffic loading on the R513
Regional road from Caherconlish to Mitchelstown and assess what improvements can be
put in place for this road and if it needs to be upgraded to National route status.

Reply:

This issue is currently being considered and an update will be provided at the November
2020 Monthly Meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District.

Meeting Adjournment

As the time had reached 4.55pm, i.e. one hour and fifty-five minutes since the start of the
Workshop and Meeting, the Elected Members agreed to adjourn the Meeting having regard
to Covid 19 guidelines on the duration of Meetings. This concluded the Meeting.

Cathaoirleach

**District Engineers Report**

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division

dated 13th October, 2020 outlining details of works, projects and future projects planned

for the District.

Following discussion the following issues were raised by Members:

 Councillor Sheahan requested a yellow box be installed outside the Catholic and

Church of Ireland churches in Askeaton to facilitate the parking of a hearse during

funerals in the town. The Senior Executive Engineer advised a yellow box would

not be appropriate, however, a designated parking space for a hearse could be

marked out at both locations.

 Councillor Keary queried if the amount of funding provided with the taking in

charge of Marine Cove, Foynes will cover the cost of the culvert works required.

The Senior Executive Engineer advised the funding of €270,000 received will not

cover the full cost of the works and further funding had been secured from the

climate change fund to complete the project.

 Discussion ensued in relation to the contactless water font due to be installed in

front of the Adare Heritage Centre. Members queried the cost of the unit, if

there would be a maintenance contract and if units would also be installed in all

the villages in the District. The Senior Executive Engineer advised that Sinead

McDonnell, Urban and Rural Community Development was responsible for the

distribution of the water fonts. The units cost €4,000 per unit, the maintenance

contract for the unit is with Ecofil and one water font provision was made

available in each District. Other locations would be considered if more units

become available.

advised Councillor Sheahan this matter be brought to the attention of the public

realm consultant.

 Councillors Keary and Teskey raised the issue of the condition of the road on the

N21 near Coolanoran filling station. The Senior Executive Engineer advised the

Mid West Road Design Office are working on a Road Safety Design for this area

located across from the Church in Askeaton. The Senior Executive Engineer

**QUESTIONS**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update for the lights numbered 7, 8 and 9 as to**

**when they will be fixed in St. Mary’s Park, Rathkeale.**

**Reply:**

The above mentioned lights were found to have no ESB power supply.

The pubic lighting section was required to apply for a new supply. The

application & payments have been processed and we are waiting on the

ESB to provide the new power supply on site. As soon as the new power

supply is provided, the Council’s public lighting maintenance contractor

will make these lights operational.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for a comprehensive reply to the flooding issue I**

**identified at Marine Cove in Foynes.**

**Reply:**

An inspection took place of the boundary between this property and the

Council owned lands to the rear of this property. There is a large cattle

grid that captures storm water directly above the property. There is a
---

bund with a fence on it extending over the lower half of the boundary, this

bund and fence is no longer in existence on the upper half. There is

evidence of recent garden terracing on the slope of the rear of the

property and it appears that this terracing undermined the boundary.

There is also evidence of pedestrian movement between the property and

the roadway above. Limerick City and County Council will reinstate the

bunding at the rear boundary of the property to stop the ingress of water

from the upper roadway. The property owner is cautioned to not

undertake any further works that might undermine this bund in the

future.

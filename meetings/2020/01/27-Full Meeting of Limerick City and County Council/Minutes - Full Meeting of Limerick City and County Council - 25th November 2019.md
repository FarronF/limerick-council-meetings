QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to

the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

8.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will ask the Council to confirm what air and water quality monitoring is currently active in all***

***Limerick Municipal Districts. I would like to know where these monitors are placed, and the***

***reasons for their positioning at these locations. I would like to know how the findings from these***

***monitors can be accessed by the public.***

**REPLY:**

**Air Monitors:** The Council operates a network of three sets of indicative air quality

monitors in the Metropolitan area. These are located as follows: (i) the junction

between O’Connell Street and William Street; (ii) Temple Mungret House, Mungret;

(iii) Castletroy College, Newtown, Castletroy.

One was placed in O’Connell Street to assess the impact of the proposed

redevelopment of O’Connell Street on air quality. The monitors in Mungret and

Castletroy were located away from traffic to show ambient/background air quality in

these areas.

Each of the sets of sensors measure particulates: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide,

nitric oxide, ozone and carbon monoxide.

Real time data from these sensors can be viewed at www.airqweb.com

In addition to the Council network, the Environmental Protection Agency has recently

installed a high quality reference monitor in the People’s Park. This measures

particulates, ozone and nitrogen dioxide. It was placed in this location to measure

background air quality in the City away from traffic. Results can be viewed at:

http://www.epa.ie/air/qualty/data/lp/

The Environmental Protection Agency intend to install a second monitor to obtain

data from a trafficked location in the city. The location for this has not yet been

finalised.

Limerick City and County Council does not operate any air quality monitoring stations

outside of the Metropolitan District. The Environmental Protection Agency operates

an indicative Air Quality Monitoring Station at the Fire Station in Abbeyfeale. This

station measures particulates, and its purpose is primarily to assess the impact of

solid fuel burning in a town outside of the restricted area. Results from this station

are

available

at:

http://www.epa.ie/air/quality/localairqualitydata/limerick-

abbeyfeale/

**Water Monitors:** There are no continuous water quality monitors in Limerick. Water

quality is sampled monthly from March to October by the Council/Irish Water

Laboratory at Worrell’s End, Castleconnell, and Corbally Baths, to look at water

quality in the context of the Bathing Water Regulations.

The Marine Institute monitors biological water quality in the Shannon Estuary to

assess status under the Water Framework Directive. Status of waterbodies can be

viewed on https://gis.epa.ie/EPAMaps/

The Council’s laboratory takes monthly grab samples from 38 sites on rivers

throughout the county. These samples are tested for nutrients and organic matter.

The laboratory also takes samples from two lakes in the County (Bleach Lough and

Lough Gur). These are also tested for nutrients and organic matter on a monthly

basis.

Bathing water samples are taken during the bathing season from Kilteery Pier and

Glin Pier.

The Environmental Protection Agency monitors biological water quality at

approximately 100 locations around the county on a three-yearly cycle. The results

of this monitoring are combined with the Council’s monitoring to establish status

under the Water Framework Directive.

Monitoring data can be found on www.catchments.ie

Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin

***I will ask at the next Meeting what proposals has Limerick City and County Council to effect a***

***modal shift to active travel and public transport as per the objectives of national policy (Smarter***

***Travel, 2009) and the Government’s Climate Action*** ***Plan.***

**REPLY:**

The Council is cognisant of the actions contained in the Climate Action Plan 2019

relating to local authority involvement in the promotion of active transport modes

and public transport and will work towards meeting the targets and deadlines set out

in the Plan.

Limerick City and County Council, in conjunction with the National Transport

Authority, is working on a Transport Strategy for the Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan

Area (LSMATS). The Strategy will set out the objectives for transport for the

Metropolitan Area for the period up to 2040.

Significant emphasis will be placed on promoting active modes, particularly for

shorter city-based journeys. Limerick, being relatively compact and flat, is ideally

suited to active modes. The promotion of public transport will be assisted by the

identification of public transport corridors, many with segregated bus lanes. Bus

priority will be provided where appropriate.

The Strategy is currently in preparation, and formal public consultation will take place

in Quarter 1, 2020, with the Strategy being finalised in Quarter 2, 2020. It will identify

short, medium and long-term actions to be implemented to incrementally build the

transport infrastructure over its lifetime. Accordingly, significant National Transport

Authority funding will be available to implement the infrastructure required for a

successful transformation to active and public transport modal shift.

Thermal Upgrade Works are also carried out under the Regeneration Programme

where all houses within Regeneration areas qualify for a Thermal Upgrade regardless

of ownership status, i.e. Local Authority or Private Ownership. All Thermal Upgrade

projects are scoped to achieve a C1 BER where all works have been implemented as

scoped.

In more recent contracts where post contract works are still in progress, post-

contract BER assessments have yet to be undertaken.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will explore the provision of***

***free sanitary products in all Limerick Council buildings, including community centres, swimming***

***pools and libraries.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan emphasised the importance of supporting

this initiative and the Committee which has been established by the Government to deal with period

poverty. She referred to the need to address the issue where girls and women struggle to afford

sanitary products.

Councillor Benson proposed amending the Motion to read as follows and this was seconded

by Councillor Butler.

**“That, Limerick City and County Council will explore the provision of free sanitary products**

**for those in emergency accommodation and those in homeless services, in all Limerick**

**Council buildings, including community centres, swimming pools and libraries.”**

Councillor O’Donovan had no objection to the amendment as proposed.

The Motion, as amended, was adopted.

**REPLY:**

It is noted that the issue of the provision of free sanitary products in public buildings

was debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year. The Government, in

response, has committed to bringing forward a series of measures to address the

matter. The Council will proceed with implementing the outcome of this process

upon its completion at national level.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Housing Department come in under the one Director.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin acknowledged the work of the housing staff and

the huge demand for service and work volume in this area. However, he stated that, in his opinion,

there was confusion around responsibility for service delivery in some areas. He then requested the

Chief Executive to bring the Housing Department in under one Director to assist in addressing the

issues he had outlined. This motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan. Members discussed the

issues and challenges in relation to housing delivery, in particular the issue of void properties.

**REPLY:**

The structure of the organisation is a function of the Chief Executive as set out in

S.149 of the Local Government Act, 2001 (as amended). During 2018, the Chief

Executive set up a specific Directorate to deal with Housing Development and deliver

on the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and

Homelessness. The delivery of these targets is supported by Operations and

Customer Services. There is no current plan to change the Organisational Structure.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Leddin

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would develop an East***

***Limerick Greenway with a view to linking Limerick City with the Suir Blueway, Tipperary.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin (B) referred to the need to develop an East

Limerick Greenway and link with the Suir Blueway in Tipperary. He stated the positive impact this

extension would have on the economy. This was seconded by Councillor Sheehan. Members

referred to the existing Great Southern Greenway and the need to upgrade this and extend the

greenway from Rathkeale into Limerick City.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has commenced work on a Sports and Recreation

Facilities Strategy. The Brief for the Consultants includes examining existing and

potential Greenways. This Notice of Motion will be considered as part of this

Strategy.

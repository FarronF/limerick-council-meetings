(b)

Circulated, copy of draft Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Metropolitan District of

Limerick held on 28th November, 2019.

Proposed by Councillor Slattery;

Seconded by Councillor Butler;

And Resolved:

“That the draft Minutes, as circulated, be taken as read and adopted and signed”.

Councillor O’Hanlon, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, submitted a reframed motion in

relation to his previous request that the Chief Executive prepare a report to allow for a variation to

the Southern Environs Local Area Plan as follows:

“While the Local Authority accepts the development of thermal recovery operations as a means of

disposing of waste, the siting criteria of such facilities is an important consideration. Thermal

recovery facilities should be sited within industrially zoned areas and with a buffer zone of 1500m

or more (calculated by direct line measurement) from the following institutions and amenities:

-

primary schools

-

post primary school

-

municipal/public park.

The stated reasons for this proposed variation are as follows:

(i)

We, the Elected Members, wish to put in place policy objectives that provide clearly defined

criteria for the siting of thermal recovery facilities within the plan area.

(ii)

We, the Elected Members, although accepting of regional and national policy that allow for

thermal recovery, believe that such facilities should not be sited within 1500m (as the crow

flies) of any primary or post primary school or municipal park in the interests of the proper

planning and sustainable development of the area and in order to protect the health and

wellbeing of children at school or play from accidental discharge of dioxins.

(iii)

The Local Authority and Department of Education have invested heavily in facilities and

amenities centred around children. Thermal recovery facilities, while an accepted option

for the processing of waste, are not deemed a conducive land use to be sited in close

proximity to such institutions and amenities”

Members discussed the reframed resolution and requested additional time to consider the

resolution and Members also requested a report to be prepared.

**QUESTIONS**

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of Limerick Metropolitan District***

***- for a breakdown of the number of house and business units connected to Patrickswell Sewerage***

***Scheme at present.***

***- for the maximum number of units that may be connected to Patrickswell Sewerage Scheme***

***before the pumping station at Barnakyle, Patrickswell reaches full capacity.***

**REPLY:**

This question was referred to the Local Representatives Support Desk in Irish Water

for response. Please see response below from Irish Water.

*In the absence of water charging account information we have had to use Census*

*data, premises usage and growth data from the Central Statistics Office to determine*

*the number of houses connected and associated loads.*

*287 no. properties (799 no persons) in Patrickswell declared as connected to the*

*public sewer network in the 2016 Census. Allowing for growth in the period 2016 to*

*2019, plus commercial activity, the collected load in Patrickswell has been assessed*

*as 993 PE (Population Equivalent).*

*The pumping capacity for Barnakyle Pumping Station is currently 75l/s (litres per*

*second). There is 63l/s spare capacity, which is capacity for 8.064 PE, equivalent to*

*2,987 residential units.*

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of Limerick Metropolitan District for an update on the***

***implementation of the proposed new speed limits along the N69 from Mungret Village to the***

***Ferrybridge***

**REPLY:**

We understand that TII will be installing and implementing the speed limits on this

section of roadway, in accordance with County Limerick Road Traffic Special Speed---
5

Limit Byelaws 2019 in the first quarter of 2020.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting that this Council explain why many streets in the city***

***centre, that used to be lit up for Christmas such as Roches Street, Nicholas Street, Catherine Street***

***and the Market Quarter, are without this year.***

**REPLY:**

A sum of €100,000 is provided in the budget of the Council every year for Christmas

lighting in the city centre. Almost all of this revenue provision is required to install,

maintain and store the festive lighting which is owned by the Council. No provision

is made in the budget to extend the street coverage. It has been the policy of the

Council for many years to provide lighting on the principal streets, such as O’Connell

Street / Patrick Street, Sarsfield Street / William Street, Thomas Street / Bedford

Row, Roches Street / Shannon Street. The Market Quarter was provided privately

by businesses in the area.

The budget also covers the provision of two Christmas trees, one located on

O’Connell Street and one on the top of William Street.

In the past the responsibility for the Christmas lights fell exclusively to the traders in

the city but this investment was not sustained by the traders, unfortunately. In the

last twelve years or so the cost of the lights has been borne totally by the Local

Authority. No support is provided by businesses or business organisations.

From time to time requests are received to extend the Christmas lighting but in the

context of the above it is not possible to do so. It is generally agreed that the

Christmas light offering in Limerick is one of the best in the country and a key

element in maintaining the standard of lighting is to restrict the street coverage.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting for an update regarding the proposed playground in***

***St. Mary’s Park.***

**REPLY:**

Kompan Ireland Ltd has been appointed to construct the King’s Island Playground.

The contractor has the play equipment on order and is scheduled to commence on

site in the new year. The project will take approximately three months to complete.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan area for an update on my motion from***

***November’s meeting, regarding the extension of TEP services to provide 24hr accommodation***

***and access for service users to daytime facilities and supports.***

**REPLY**:

In relation to the Notice of Motion on the TEP Service in November, I outlined that

the Service could not be extended given the constraints of the build in terms of

capacity for a communal living environment. However, the Drop In Centre is

currently operating extended day service into the evening. Further Day Services are---
6

available in terms of the HSE Health Supports e.g. GP, Addiction Support, PHN,

Community Mental Health Nurse etc…

Limerick City and County Council are currently working on new solutions for the TEP

Service Users within other services and also exploring new independent

accommodation that will support their needs.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan area how many people are currently homeless***

***the DPG grants on the Chief Executives monthly reports, as are done with the Mobility Aids Grant,***

***Housing Adaptation Grant for People with Disabilities and the Housing Aid for Older Persons***

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick if a formal process has commenced to***

***notify all relevant parties, including the developer of Curragower House, Clancy Strand, that it***

***has been placed on the record of protected structures. I ask the Council to confirm that this has***

***been done and if not, the reasons for the delay.***

**REPLY**:

The initiation of the formal process, which is an executive function, has not

commenced and will not be initiated. The Conservation Officer, Limerick City and

County Council, prepared a report on the said building assessing it under the eight

areas of significance provided for under Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the

Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). These are: Architectural,

Historical, Archaeological, Artistic, Cultural, Scientific, Social and Technicial interest.

The assessment concludes that Curragower House is not of such special interest to

warrant its inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures.

Councillor O’Donovan requested that the report of the Conservation Officer be circulated to all

Members. She requested legal advice in relation to adding or removing a building from the Record

of Protected Structures.

Members referred to the submission of Questions and Notice of Motions for inclusion on the

agenda. The Meetings Administrator outlined the process to the Members. The Meetings

Administrator also confirmed that Officials are requested to attend the meeting where there is a

Notice of Motion relevant to their Directorate for discussion on the agenda.---

The Director, Service Operations confirmed to Members that a briefing will be arranged to discuss

Curragower House.

**14.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting for a detailed breakdown of how housing allocations***

***are prioritised and how can individuals find out where they are on the housing list.***

**REPLY**:

Allocations are in accordance with the Allocation Scheme 2017 as adopted by the

Elected Members. The purpose of this Allocation Scheme is to provide a means of

determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings. The

manner in which the Housing Authority will allocate dwellings, or different

categories of dwellings, or to different classes of households, shall have regard to

the order of priority as set out below:

1. Priority shall be given to applicants living in dwellings deemed to be dangerous

as defined in Section 3 of the Sanitary Services Act, 1964 or being displaced by

operations of the Local Authority.

2. Priority shall be given to applicants deemed to be homeless under Section 2 of

the Housing Act, 1988.

3. Priority shall be given to applicants living in dwellings deemed to be unfit as

defined in Section 66 of the Housing Act, 1966.

4. Priority shall be given to applicants in need of housing on disability, medical,

compassionate or similar grounds.

5. Priority shall be given to applicants living in dwellings deemed to be

overcrowded as defined in Section 63 of the Housing Act, 1966.

6. Priority shall be given to applicants in need of housing who are living in

unsuitable accommodation having regard to the particular household

circumstances in accordance with 23 (f) Social Housing Assessment Regulations

2011.

7. Priority shall be given to persons who are sharing accommodation with another

person or persons and who, in the opinion of the Housing Authority, have a

reasonable requirement for separate accommodation.

8. Priority shall be given to applicants not included in any other category above

who have been assessed and approved for social housing support.

9. Priority shall be given to persons who are, in the opinion of the Housing

Authority, not reasonably able to meet the cost of their mortgage and are unable

to obtain suitable affordable alternative accommodation.

Whilst allocations will be made in accordance with the above order of priority,

where a number of applicants fall within the same category, regard shall be had to

the length of time that has elapsed since the applicant qualified for inclusion as a

qualified applicant for housing by Limerick City and County Council.

The manner in which Limerick City and County Council allocate properties is based

on the Order of Priority of the Basis Need of each approved housing applicant in

accordance with the Allocations Scheme as adopted by the Elected

Members.  Limerick City and County Council do not operate a placement system on

the Housing Waiting List. Housing Applications are assessed in line with the Social---
9

Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 (SI84/2011), Priority (Medical, Homeless,

etc.) at this point is based on the assessment of the person or family in terms of the

Allocation Scheme 2017.

The full text of the adopted Allocation Scheme 2017 is available on Limerick.ie.

information will be provided at the next Metropolitan meeting.

**16.**

The Council’s Domestic Waste and Litter Team issues Questionnaires on Household

Waste Management Disposal to households as part of its daily operations to tackle

illegal dumping, etc., verifies / records the returns submitted and takes appropriate

follow-up action. To date, in 2019 over 500 such surveys have been logged.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas (to be referred to the Local Electoral**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan area to extinguish the pedestrian right of***

In proposing the motion Councillor Kiely referred to the need for this right of way to be

extinguished. Councillor Kiely stated that she had written to the Principal in relation to this and

received no objection. Councillor Kiely confirmed that the School Warden operates from a different

location therefore the extinguishment of pedestrian right of way would not impact on their job.

This was seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed.---
11

**REPLY:**

With regard to this laneway I understand that it is currently closed due to works that

were carried out at the Queen of Peace School. I would be prepared to meet with

***commencement of Insulin pump therapy as a treatment option for adults with type 1 diabetes***

***attending University Hospital Limerick.***

**(g) Did this farm building receive grant-aid from the Department of Agriculture.**

Limerick City and County Council does not hold any records in relation to funding of this

nature from the Department of Agriculture.

**(h)** **Was there a requirement to apply for planning permission to construct this 800**

**metres additional section of trail.**

The proposed works do not require Part 8 Planning consent.

**(i) What design features are included in this project towards accommodating people**

**with special needs who wish to use the Greenway.**

A phased approach has been taken to the upgrade work on the Greenway. Phase 1

improvement works will focus on the surfacing, farm crossings, drainage, gates and other

ancillary works. Phases 2 and 3 works are currently being designed and will focus on access

point upgrades, and cattle underpasses respectively. The following considerations have been

incorporated into the Phase 1 improvement works to accommodate users with special needs.



**Surfacing:** The existing gravel surfacing is in poor condition with local surface irregularities,

standing water and low levels of grip in certain locations, it is not suitable for all users. A

smooth open-graded asphalt surfacing has been included in the Phase 1 upgrade works

for the Greenway. This will provide a smooth level and consistent surface, which can be

more easily maintained, will have improved drainage, and will be provide a more

consistent level of skid resistance. Surface irregularities and unevenness in the existing

surfacing will be smoothed out before the new surfacing is applied. The installation of the

new surfacing will be to a very high standard and in line with the Transport Infrastructure

Ireland guidance on flexible pavement. This type of surface is a major part of the works

and was selected with universal accessibility in mind.



**Greenway Width:** The existing Greenway width varies with some narrow sections with

width as low as 1.8m, which is below the passing width recommended for wheelchair

users. Under the Phase 1 works, the Greenway will be widened to 3.0m. The 3.0m width

is in line with the national guidance on cycleways and is in excess of the minimum clear

passing width recommended by the Irish Wheelchair Association. The 3.0m width will

increase the space available for all users, and allow sufficient space for all users to pass

comfortably.



**Greenway Gradients:** The overall gradient along the cycle route is an important design

consideration. Steep uphill gradients can cause difficulties for many Greenway users,

while steep downhill gradients can generate high downhill speeds for cyclists, increasing

the potential to conflict with other users who may be struggling to climb the steep

gradient in the opposite direction. In areas where the current Greenway exceeds the

national standards for gradients, works will be carried out to reduce the gradients,

bringing them into line with the applicable standard.---
8



**Cross Fall:** The cross fall on the new Greenway surface has been designed with a 2%

gradient to prevent surface water pooling and improve drainage. Higher cross fall

gradients are not recommended for wheelchair users. The 2% gradient has been selected

to balance the drainage and universal access requirements.



**Gates:** Several of the existing gates at public road junctions or private entrance crossings

on the Greenway do not allow for universal access. These gates are to be replaced. The

proposed chicane gate arrangement is in line with national guidance and will provide for

universal access for all users. The gates will have a permanently open section with a

minimum clear width of 1.2m. The two leaves of the chicane gates have been spaced 5m

apart, these will act as a speed control feature for cyclists while the 5m will still provide

sufficient room for special needs users to navigate easily through them.



**Farm Crossing Points:** A number of the existing farm crossings have cattle grids, gates, or

surface deterioration which makes access for users with special needs difficult. These will

be upgraded, all Greenway users will be able to traverse the farm crossings unobstructed.

A textured concrete surfacing will be installed in some of these locations, where

considered appropriate, to provide an additional level of grip, provide a more easily

cleaned surface and prevent future surface deterioration from farm vehicles. The interface

between the new asphalt surface and the concrete farm crossing will be flush finished so

that there is no obstruction for users on the Greenway. Some farm crossing points will

receive further upgrade works by the installation of a cattle underpass during later phases.



**Access Points:** Under the Phase 1 works, the following considerations have been included.

At public road junctions, colour contrast surfacing will be provided to demark the

approaches to public roads. The approach to public roads junctions, bridge structures,

farm crossings and private entrances will be excavated so that the new surfacing can be

finished flush with the existing public road or bridge structures to remove obstructions or

potential trip hazards which would otherwise be created by the level difference. Gates at

road junctions, private entrances and trailheads will be upgraded as described above to

improve accessibility of all users. Further upgrades to access points will be incorporated

in later phases. One of the key considerations in the purchase of the Ardagh Stationhouse

site has been to enable the Council in the near future provide level access to the Greenway

from the village of Ardagh.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask** **at the next Meeting for a detailed breakdown of €175,000 allocated to meet**

**Traveller needs during COVID-19 pandemic; has this money been spent and, if not, what**

**are the plans for the rest of this funding.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council spent €175,000 during the recent pandemic

to support members of the Travelling Community through the purchase of

mobile homes, the provision of chemical toilets, the provision of signage in

Traveller Specific Accommodation, preparing an area in Rathkeale in

conjunction with the HSE to provide an isolation area in Rathkeale, if required,---
9

and the rehousing of families from Traveller Specific Accommodation to

generic housing as requested by families.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the Council’s allocations for Traveller-specific**

**accommodation; how much of this funding has been spent in 2020 and what are the plans**

**for expenditure for 2020.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council, to date, has currently spent over €770K in 2020

on Traveller Accommodation Capital Projects. There are currently four Traveller

Capital Projects in progress at this time, which will be completed in the coming

months. There are also plans for further Traveller Accommodation Capital Projects

to commence in the last Quarter of 2020.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor B. Collins

**I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council will immediately establish**

**a Working Group of all relevant stakeholders to design, deliver and roll out a marketing**

**strategy advertising Limerick City and County as a Safe Destination for visitors.**

**REPLY:**

As Ireland starts to open up for domestic travel, we need to make sure that

residents of Limerick and the rest of Ireland look at Limerick with new eyes and

discover all it has to offer, not just as a weekend visit but as a longer holiday

destination. Fáilte Ireland will drive the case for domestic tourism overall,

highlighting safety and urging people to leave behind their lockdown

mentality. Limerick City and County Council has been briefed and is fully on

board with embracing this safety message.

To align with this, the Council will run its own domestic marketing campaign to

push the case for Limerick and showcase that the City and County is brimming

with things to do to ensure the most memorable of holidays in Ireland. A

campaign strategy, creative concept and platform has already been identified

and the campaign is set to be launched over the coming weeks.

Limerick City and County Council is a member of Fáilte Ireland’s Gateway

Steering Group, which is an industry-led forum set up to capitalise on Limerick’s

position on the Wild Atlantic Way. As part of the campaign, Limerick City and

County Council has been engaging with this forum and also local hotels and

attractions to profile them as part of the campaign.---

NOTICES OF MOTION

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will move at the next Meeting that (a) this Council totally reject the National Planning**

**Framework policy regarding once-off rural housing based on social and economic need; (b)**

**a Meeting be arranged with the Minister responsible to highlight the issues around this**

**policy; and (c) this Motion be circulated to all Local Authorities to discuss and support same.**

It was noted that this Motion had been dealt with at the Council Meeting of 26th June,

2020.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister**

**for Housing, Planning and Local Government to introduce comprehensive legislation on the**

**operation of current and future retirement villages, as already exists in many other**

**jurisdictions.**

Councillor Secas, having proposed the Motion, went on to say that Castletroy residents

had seen much distress and a lot of issues with the Park Village in Castletroy since November

2019, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when the situation at the Park Village was

making local and national headlines; and that this situation would not have occurred if there

were specific legislation in Ireland as per her Motion. She also said that any person moving

into a retirement village should have security of tenancy and security of maintenance of

services, and asked whether the Programme for Government included any provision that the

Government would enact such legislation as existed in other jurisdictions (i.e. the UK and

Australia). She went on to say that Ireland needed legislation that would provide a regulatory

framework for the operation of the existing and any future retirement villages, that would

ensure best practice management standards by the operators, and that would ensure the

right balance between the rights and the responsibilities of the residents and the operators

of the retirement villages.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheehan and agreed.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin **(to be referred to Home and**

**Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

**development by Limerick 2030 in Mungret and that the Council not accept any alternative**

**options as provided under the relevant housing legislation.**

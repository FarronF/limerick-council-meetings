**Strategic Housing Development (SHD) Application to An Bord Pleanála at Newcastle,**

**Castletroy, Limerick**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting stating it was being held to consider

and discuss the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) Application to An Bord Pleanála, at

Newcastle, Castletroy, Limerick.

Mr. S. Duclot, A/Senior Planner, was present to deliver a presentation on the proposed

development at Newcastle, Castletroy. Mr. Duclot reminded those present that, as the

development contained more than 100 housing units, the planning application goes straight to

An Bord Pleanála.

Members then raised various concerns they had in relation to the proposed development at

Newcastle, Castletroy, which included:

 Existing access road: The existing road serving the adjacent primary school and Munster

GAA offices is not adequate as it stands currently, without an extra 200 housing units using

the same access road.

 Access: to have one access point for the adjacent school and Munster GAA offices and for

the proposed development is not sufficient - the proposed development requires its own

access road.

 Traffic system: to access the proposed development, one must drive down to the

Annacotty roundabout and return on the development side of the road. Concerns were

expressed that this is not an adequate way for the future residents to enter their estate if

coming from the Limerick City side. The large increase in traffic that the development

would bring to an already congested area was also a cause for concern.

 Pedestrian Crossing: A pedestrian crossing would be required for the primary school if this

development proceeds.

 Social Housing: The current plans group 16 of the social houses together, and concerns

were raised that this will stigmatise the tenants of the social housing and that, instead,

they social housing units should be dispersed amongst the development.

 Density: concerns were raised over the number of units proposed to be built within the

4.64 hectare site.

 Bicycle parking: concerns were raised over the lack of bicycle parking spaces in the

proposed development.

 Lack of open space: concerns were raised over the lack of open space apparent on the

drawings of the proposed development.

 Consultation with adjoining residents: It was said that there was no consultation with

adjoining residents about this development, and the planning application was submitted

during the holiday period and so may have gone unnoticed by adjoining residents.

 Road Safety Statement: The shared use of the road infrastructure in the proposed

development /on the Dublin Road was a cause for concern. The additional 300 cars that

would be added from the proposed development is a safety concern for walkers and

cyclists within the development and for cyclists on the Dublin Road. It was asked where

the cycle lanes would be placed within the development.

 Tree Survey: concerns were raised over what trees should be retained.

 Landscape Plan: The Landscape plan refers to native species but this contradicts the

planting plan which refers to non-native species. More detail was asked for in relation to

this matter.

 The schools in the vicinity are already at capacity, they cannot expand as they are

landlocked. Concerns were raised as to where the children in the new development would

attend school. An Bord Pleanála are not aware of this matter and the proposed

development needs to be scaled back as a result.

 Lack of open green space: concerns were raised at the lack of green open space for children

to play in.

 BER rating: concerns were raised at the lack of BER detail of the proposed housing units.

Mr.

S

Duclot

then

addressed

some

of

the

concerns

above,

stating

that:

 The developers were not required to consult with adjoining residents and that they

completed all statutory planning obligations.

 There are 243 bicycle spaces in total, 126 of which are allocated to apartments, 42 bicycle

stands, and 75 bicycle parking stands for visitors.

 All housing units will have a BER of A2 or A3.

 Density per hectare is within the regulations.

 The

usable

open

space

requirement

of

15%

is

met.

Further, Mr. Duclot reminded those present that Limerick City and County Council were not the

deciding authority, and that the purpose of his presence was to outline the proposed development

to Members. Mr. Duclot stated that all amendments and observations will be taken on board and

form part of the Chief Executive’s report to An Bord Pleanála as required by Section 5(a)(iii) of the

Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016. On foot of a request

from Councillor Sheahan, Mr. Duclot advised that the Chief Executive’s report for An Bord Pleanála

would be distributed to all members of the Metropolitan district.

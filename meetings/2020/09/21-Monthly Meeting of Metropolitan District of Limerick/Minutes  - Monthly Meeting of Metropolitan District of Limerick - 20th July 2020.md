**QUESTIONS**

**6. Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***Limerick Museum has reopened in line with Government Guidelines, However as it only opens***

***from Monday to Friday between 10am and 5pm, I am requesting that it should be opened up for***

***longer hours and more days such as weekends to allow people to visit and also to allow for easier***

***implementation for social distancing.***

**REPLY:** On the 29th June 2020 Limerick Museum reopened for 5 days per week Monday to Friday,

including lunch time opening. Since then new procedures and practices have been put in place in

order to meet Covid-19 safety requirements.

A review is currently underway to examine how the Museum can open at weekends in accordance

with the new Covid-19 operating guidelines. When this review is complete we will revert to the

Council with a further update.

**7. Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council have completed inspections of***

***the vacant properties in Newenham Street and if a report is yet available.***

**REPLY:** The inspections in Newenham Street are in progress but report is not yet completed.

**8. Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council how many social and affordable houses have been***

***delivered under LIHAF, where the schemes are and the costs per scheme provided to developers.***

**REPLY:** Mungret Gate is the only LIHAF site in Limerick.

To date our records show that a total of 98 LIHAF reduced properties have sold in Mungret. 20---
5

properties have been agreed for social rental under Part V of the Planning and Development Act

(as amended). None of the Part V Units have been delivered as yet as they are in later phases.

No funding in the scheme has been provided to any developer. Grant funding in the amount of

€7.88m has been approved by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the

development of the road infrastructure on the site.

**9. Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council how much funding has been applied for to the NTA to***

***facilitate Guiding Limerick through Covid infrastructure works and how much funding has been***

***received.***

**REPLY**: We are in regular contact with the National Transport Authority in relation to guiding

Limerick through Covid. Currently the Council has applied for €150,000 in funding for capital

expenditure relating to this project and to date €100,000 has been received in this regard.

**10. Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next meeting whether assessment is being done of the impact of individual***

***measures of the Guiding Limerick through Covid-19 plan, what metrics are being used (for***

***measuring, among others, advisory speed limit compliance, changes in footfall, uptake of cycling,***

***air pollution levels, citizen satisfaction, economic impact, etc.), and when will the results be***

***available?***

**REPLY**: The Guiding Limerick through Covid-19 Plan developed through consultation by Limerick

City and County Council set out a large number of measures under a number of headings to assist

Limerick through COVID19. These include;

 Measures to change our public spaces

 Culture and place making measures

 Business support measures

**1. Changing our Public Spaces**

Counts have been undertaken on weeks beginning the 6th and 13th July to assess traffic, pedestrian

and cycle numbers at a number of locations throughout the city.

Similar and ongoing counts will be undertaken following implementation of the measures to

determine impact on footfall, cycling and car movements and will be available as the scheme

develops. In addition, existing noise and air monitors located in the city will also measure these

important environmental metrics.

Subject to availability of resources, consideration will be given to carrying out a number of vehicle

speed surveys in the city.

**2. Culture and Place Making Measures**

The success of these Culture and Place Making measures is monitored by the numbers of people

attending the various events and the level of interest from local artists in the public call. We will---
6

also monitor the level of coverage in the local media channels.

**3. Business Support Measures**

The numbers of organisations availing of the various support measures and grants monitors the

success of the business support measures.

We will document and review the measures as outlined above in September.

**11. Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next meeting how many of the Council staff have completed training in Design***

***Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS), and National Cycle Manual (NCM) and if there is***

***any training planned in the near future with the focus on the changed circumstances due to the***

***Covid-19 public health crisis and the implications of it?***

**REPLY**: All Council staff working in road infrastructure projects are fully aware of both DMURS and

the NCM and have regards to contents of both in the projects being managed, in some cases

through internal tutoring, as recent organised training has not been available.  It should be noted

that the design process for most NTA schemes is actually carried out by 3rd party consultants, who

are required to be fully conversant with both manuals.

However, it is acknowledged that the NCM is becoming increasingly significant in the context of

current and new NTA schemes and discussions are underway with the NTA to organise some

courses in this area, both for consultants and relevant Council staff.

In a similar fashion, refresher courses in DMURS will be undertaken for the newer members of staff

working in this area when they are readily available again.

However, it should also be noted that individual staff training requirements are a matter for line

managers as part of their Performance Development Plan.

**12.** **Question submitted by Councillor E O’Donovan**

***I will ask the Council for an update on the installation of advisory speed limit signs in Limerick***

***City centre. I would like to know the contractors hired for these works and cost. Was there an***

***additional cost to Limerick Council for the poles installed and subsequently removed on Sarsfield***

***Bridge? Who is responsible for quality control of these works?***

**REPLY**: Signage associated with the 25kph advisory speed for the city centre has now been erected

at the most appropriate locations entering the zone where the advisory is being publicised. In

accordance with the Mobility Plan, as approved, additional signage associated with restricted

access to certain roads has also been erected in accordance with National Guidance and Traffic

Regulations. Grant funding has been provided for such works and implementation is managed by

Limerick City and County Council’s Transport and Infrastructure Department.

Limerick City and County Council operates publicly tendered framework contracts for road

maintenance and small civil works. There are a number of contractors on this framework and

Maramba Road Services Ltd is one of these contractors and was engaged for the speed limit signs---
7

work. All contractors must produce a current tax clearance certificate to be paid and comply with

the Government conditions of contract for public works. The cost for all the speed limit signs

installed was €6050. Two poles were unfortunately vandalised on Sarsfield Bridge and had to be

replaced at a cost of €240 plus VAT. The Senior Engineer (Roads) is responsible for the quality

control.

**13.** **Question submitted by Councillor E O’Donovan**

***I will ask the Council for an update on feasibility of speed restriction measures and segregated***

***cycling infrastructure on Hyde Road and Ballycummin Road***

**REPLY:** We have commenced discussion with the NTA about introducing traffic calming measures

on Hyde Road. The proposals would include rationalising and improving the side road junctions

and incorporating a cycleway on both sides of the road. Following this progressive discussion, a

formal application to include Hyde Road as an NTA project in 2020 has been made and we await

confirmation of funding before commencing the design process. A request will also be made to the

NTA to include for cycleway infrastructure/traffic calming measures on Ballycummin Road.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

It was agreed to take Item 17 next on the agenda.

**17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***public consultations to include online and public forums to facilitate engagement prior to LSMATS***

***strategy being brought to Council.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor M. Sheahan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Leddin stated that the LSMATS was one of the most important

documents in the lifetime of the Council and that stakeholders and the public should be involved

in the process.

**REPLY**: The public consultation for the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy

(LSMATS) will be run directly by the National Transport Authority (NTA). The request to facilitate

online and public forums has now been brought to the NTA for consideration and will be discussed

in an upcoming meeting between the NTA, Limerick City and County Council and Clare County

Council. We will advise of a decision once the consultation process has been finalised.

**14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council introduce traffic calming***

***measures on Hyde Road, Limerick to reduce speeding on this road.***

traffic calming measures and the urgency for funding to be drawn down from the National

Transport Authority.---

Members supported the motion and queried if speed cameras could be used in the area.

**REPLY**: We have commenced discussion with the NTA about introducing traffic calming measures

on Hyde Road. The proposals would include rationalising and improving the side road junctions

confirmation of funding before commencing the design process.

The motion was proposed by Councillor McSweeney, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

form part of a feasibility study for the future refurbishment and re-use of this structure under the

Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan.

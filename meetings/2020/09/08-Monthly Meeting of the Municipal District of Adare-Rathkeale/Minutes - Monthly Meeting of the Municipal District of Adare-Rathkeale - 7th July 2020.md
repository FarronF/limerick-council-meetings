Limerick City and County Council are committed to working with the

elected members and the local community on the regeneration of

Askeaton and harnessing the potential of this historic town. The

regeneration plan requested will be achieved through the following:

1.

The council will commence prepartion of a public realm plan for Askeaton

in 2020. The plan will identify the needs and opportunities for public

spaces and streetscap enhancement. It will be used as a key tool to guide

and prompt future public and private investment in the town.

2.

The Council have submitted a successful application under the Rural

Regeneration & Development Fund (RRDF) for dealing with dereliction in 5

towns in County Limerick. Askeaton is one of the seleted towns. This will

enable the Council build on existing progress in tackling dereliction

including in the oldest part of the town.

Community Survey/Plan completed this year funded by Limerick City and

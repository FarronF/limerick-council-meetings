operating model for policing where she would be assuming the role of Superintendent in the

had seen an increase in recent months, particularly in commercial premises, and she
confirmed that An Garda Siochana were looking at measures to address same. She also
confirmed that while drink driving detections had reduced, that drug driving detections had
increased over recent years.

Superintendent Magner also outlined details of 57 domestic violence cases responded to by
an Garda Siochana in 2019 and stressed the importance of people contacting the Gardai in
such situations if they felt they were in danger. It was also the policy of the Gardaf to
subsequently follow up with complainants as part of the process of dealing with such
complaints.

The Elected Members thanked the Superintendent for her presentation, and welcomed the
reduction in crime in certain categories and noted the increase of incidences of burglaries and
drug driving in particular. They agreed that it was essential that people remained vigilant in
relation to any possible crime in the community, and to be vigilant about suspicious cars or
unusual activity in an area.

The Elected Members also expressed concern at the proposed changes to the Garda policing
structures and the proposal that the Bruff District would not have a full time Superintendent.
They highlighted the size of the District and the importance of increased resources, such as
additional Gardai and vehicles, being provided into the District to support the work being
done currently by An Garda Siochana. They also stressed the importance of Garda Stations in
rural areas being staffed and that resources should not be taken from the District to support
Garda activities in another District.

The Elected Members also highlighted the ongoing need for increased awareness and
education in schools and elsewhere on the dangers of illegal drug taking which was
widespread across the whole community.

Finally, it was agreed to circulate contact details of the Elected Members, and the
representatives from an Garda Siochana and Limerick City and County Council who were at
the Meeting and the Meetings Administrator agreed to circulate same.

This concluded the business of the meeting.

Signed:
Cathaoirleach

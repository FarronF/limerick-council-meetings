Under Matters Arising, the Elected Members referred to recent media reports citing a
reference to “cronyism” by an Elected Member in reference to the election of the
Cathaoirleach and Leas Cathaoirlech at the Annual Meeting in June of the Municipal District.

The Elected Members who objected to the use of this word outlined that, following the
result of the Local Elections in 2019, that a pact was in place between Fine Gael and Fianna
Fail and as a result, the election of Cathaoirleach and Leas Cathaoirleach was driven by this
political agreement. They also noted that such political agreements are common across
most local authorities.

The Elected Members noted the excellent co-operation and understanding in the past
between all those who represented the Municipal District, and believed it was incorrect and
unfair to use such a term in relation to the election process at the recent Annual Meeting.
The Elected Members were adamant that the election process was conducted in an open
and transparent manner at this meeting.

The Elected Member, who used the word cronyism, defended his use of the word. He stated
that it was unfair that one long serving independent Elected Member would not get an
opportunity to serve as Cathaoirleach or Leas Cathaoirleach, because of this political
agreement. This Elected Member also accepted that he had not canvassed his fellow Elected
Members prior to the Annual Meeting to try to change the election pact that was in place.

Muni District of Ca ore-Kilma Places

He confirmed that the statutory Bye-Law process required the Local Authority to undertake
a public consultation process prior to the adoption of the Draft Municipal District of
Cappamore-Kilmallock (Parking Places) (Amendment) Byelaws, 2020 and that approval of
the draft Bye-Laws for publication is a reserved function of the Council.

A discussion took place on electric vehicles in general and the Elected Members agreed that
there should be greater availability of electric vehicle charging points across the Municipal
District and that local authorities should be more pro-active in the provision of charging
points to support the move to electric vehicles over the coming decade.

authority sector in relation to the provision of electric vehicle charging points and that
guidelines for same were in the process of being drafted to ensure consistency of

Reply:

Within the Council’s Economic Development Directorate, there are three business units that
have as their remit the support of the jobs / business units of the Economic Development of
the Council are structured along the following lines:

e Trade & Investment — mainly deals with the large FD! companies and supports IDA/E|
in their promotion of Limerick as an investment location

¢ Innovate Limerick — drives business innovation for all sizes of company and develops
business ecosystems / clusters etc. It also oversees the Enterprise Units located
across the City and County.

e Local Enterprise Office — supports micro businesses (up to 10 employees) by offering
a range of business supports such as grant funding, training, mentoring, etc.

While each unit has a distinct range of responsibilities, there are many areas of overlap and
they collaborate on many job creation and business support initiatives. The three units have
a countywide remit.

In addition to dealing with individual companies across Limerick, the units would be in
regular contact with business representative groups such as Chambers of Commerce, ISME,
and IBEC etc. with a view to improving the business environment of their clients.

In addition, there are also a number of other economic development agencies operating
under the framework of the Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) for Limerick City
and County prepared by the LCDC. Ballyhoura Development, West Limerick resources and
the Paul Partnership each have a role to play in business support in their own respective
areas.

Anew Head of Enterprise in the Limerick Enterprise Office will be appointed in the next two
months and they will review the delivery of services across the city and county to ensure
that all areas are receiving the highest level of support available.

6. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

1 will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock that
Limerick City and County Council seek immediate funding from the Department of Justice &
Equality, and from within the Local Authority, for the installation of CCTV security cameras
throughout the Municipal District for areas that were not included in the first phase of the
CCTV installation programme.

Proposed by Cllr Mitchell, seconded by Clir Teefy and agreed.

Reply:

There is a high demand for CCTV across all communities in Limerick City & County. The
provision of CCTV requires capital funding and revenue expenditure for long-term operations
and maintenance. Limerick City and County Council is currently drafting a CCTV Strategy to
bring before Council for approval, which will provide a roadmap for the maintenance of
existing CCTV and the future provision of CCTV within Limerick. Until such times as Limerick
City and County Council has determined its strategy, the notice of motion as proposed would
be premature.

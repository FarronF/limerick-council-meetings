calming proposals.

A survey, design and costing will be prepared by the Council and a source of funding needs to

be identified.

2.

Physical Development Directorate

To receive update on proposed works for Ward’s Cross and Devon

Cross.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Executive Engineer, Mid West National Road Design Office

to the Meeting.

**Wards Cross**

The Executive Engineer, gave an update to the Members on the proposed works for N21

Ward’s Cross and stated that Ward’s Cross was identified as having a high collision rate.

The technical consultants appointed for the scheme, Barry Transportation, have progressed

the detailed design for the right turn lane at N21 Ward’s Cross. To progress the detailed

design a ground investigation and topographical survey have been carried out. A number of

design issues arose from retrofitting a right turn lane into an existing road layout. These

issues included the carriageway alignment, the location of properties in the vicinity of the

junction, the topography of the surrounding land, the existing road surface drainage and the

presence of a water main. Many of these issues do not conform to current road design

parameters and required departure from standards from TII. The technical consultants have

worked to refine the design and remove as many departures from standards as possible.

Barry Transportation have progressed the detailed design for the right turn lane and have

produced design drawings and a cost estimate for the proposed works. These were

submitted to TII for comments and comments have been considered.

The Executive Engineer stated that it is hoped to finalise the design process and seek TII

approval to proceed to preparation of tender documents shortly. She also stated that in

order to complete the design process a Road Safety Audit, Departures Application,
---

Preliminary Design Report and further consultations with Irish Water is required.

At this point, Councillor Collins left the meeting.

**Devon Cross**

The Executive Engineer, Mid West National Road Design Office also gave an update to

Members on the proposed works for N21 Devon Cross. She stated that the TII highlighted

this junction as having potential safety issues.

Following identification and notification of the site by TII, staff from Mid West National Road

Design Office (MWNRDO) carried out a further assessment of this location and safety issues

raised. The MWNRDO recommended to TII that initial design stage solutions be advanced

and that technical engineering consultancy services be procured to carry this out. Barry

Transportation progressed the initial design stage solutions and a topographical survey and

traffic survey were undertaken. A feasibility report was also submitted which outlined three

options that was developed for the junction and recommends the option to create a

staggered junction by realigning the local road north of the N21, the L7059 that commences

from Buckley’s Shop, to the east of Devon Cross.

She stated that the report has been submitted to TII for approval of the recommendation in

the finalised feasibility report and allocation of funding. The MWNRDO are endeavouring to

secure this funding to allow Barry Transportation to proceed with the initial design process

and preparation of tender documents. It is hoped that a response from the TII will be received

by August.

The Members welcomed the update and a discussion took place on a number of matters

including funding and the length of time taken to progress these projects since they were first

raised approximately three years ago. The cost of providing reports on these junctions to the

TII was also discussed.

Places)(Amendment) Bye-Laws, 2020.

2020.

Directorate, to the Meeting.

The A/Senior Executive Officer stated that the purpose of the draft Bye-Laws is to extend the

to review after twenty four months from the date of adoption, which is due to cease on 31st

August, 2020.

The A/Senior Executive Officer also stated that if adopted, the Draft Bye-Laws would also

create an exemption from the requirement to pay parking fees for a maximum of four hours

and that this exemption would be reviewed after a period of twenty four months from their

adoption to take account of potential growth of the EV sector.

He informed the Meeting that the statutory bye-law making process required that the Council

undertake a public consultation process prior to the adoption of the Draft Municipal District

of Newcastle West (Parking Places)(Amendment) Bye-Laws, 2020 and that approval of the

draft bye-laws for publication is a reserved function of the Council.

A discussion took place on electric vehicles in general and it was suggested that a pilot scheme

should take place in large urban areas prior to preventing the sale of traditional vehicles by

2030. It was also noted that there are not enough public charging points for electric vehicles.

It was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Sheahan that the Draft Bye

Laws should commence the public consultation process.

4.

Capital Investment Directorate

To receive update on the progress on Abbeyfeale Traffic

Management Plan.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the A/Director, Capital Investments and the Senior Executive

Engineer, Design and Delivery to the Meeting.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Design and Delivery Services, gave an update to the Members

on Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan.

He stated that works are progressing on the design of the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management

Plan. The pedestrian counts to determine the locations of pedestrian crossing points had to

be deferred due to Covid-19. However drawings are being prepared for the additional parking

to the rear of Main Street and discussions are ongoing with the owners of lands affected with

legal agreements to acquire land progressing. It was also noted that detailed drawings for the

plan are being finalised and following this discussion will take place with the TII regarding

funding for the scheme.

The Members welcomed the update but stated that detailed drawings of the scheme are

urgently required as comments had been given to stakeholders that the drawings would be

make available and a working group had also been set up. The need to have off street parking

in place before commencing work on the main streets was also highlighted. The working

model of the proposed traffic lights for Joy’s Corner was also raised. It was noted that there

is also a fear that funding to progress the project could be lost due to the current Covid 19

crisis.
---

Discussion took place on the proposed off street parking plans and it was noted that the

project is to cost in the region of €5m to complete. It was also noted that the TII are onboard

with progressing the scheme with a landscape Architect and a Road Safety Officer designated

to the scheme also.

Discussion also took place on the proposed housing development at Colbert Terrace,

Abbeyfeale and the A/Director, Capital Investments, noted that as the number of houses

proposed for the scheme had been reduced as part of the Part VIII planning process, the street

upgrade would now take place under the main Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan as the

cost of street works could not be absorbed by the housing development plan.

The Members requested that both projects should commence concurrently.

The derelict sites on Colbert Terrace were also noted and the Director, Community

Development, gave a summary of the progress on this matter. He also noted that the Council

had received funding of €1.5m under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund to tackle

derelict sites in five towns and villages in Limerick and Abbeyfeale is one of these town. The

aim of the project is to bring derelict properties in the core of towns and villages back into

use with an emphasis on re-use for housing. Resettlement of populations in the core of towns

and villages is needed for their sustainable development.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting what steps are being taken in terms of village renewal for***

***Ardagh.***

REPLY:

The location of Ardagh on the Great Southern Greenway presents a significant

opportunity for the village and it will benefit from the substantial upgrade

works currently underway. In order to further harness this potential, Limerick

City and County Council have purchased the old Ardagh Stationhouse and

lands. Works to preserve the fabric of the building including a new roof will

commence in 2020. The Council will discuss options for the use of the site with

the elected members and community in the near future.

A key challenge facing Ardagh is the high level of derelict and vacant property

in the village. Ardagh has been selected as one of 5 towns and villages in

County Limerick that will benefit from a €2m project to address vacant and

derelict property. This project will be funded by the Rural Regeneration and

Development Fund with match funding from Limerick City and County Council.

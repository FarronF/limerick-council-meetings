The Mayor thanked those present for attending the Special Meeting and outlined that it was

being held in order to pass a Vote of Sympathy for former Mayor, Pat Kennedy, who had

passed away. He expressed his condolences to his wife, Loretto, and children Tom, Loretto,

Alex and Shane, on their loss. He stated that while Pat was a public figure most of his life, he

was also a loving husband and father and his loss would be most keenly felt.

He went on to say that Pat had distinguished himself during his almost half a century serving

the people of Limerick. He was a powerful politician and a man of integrity and conviction.

His contributions to Limerick were hugely welcome and had helped shape the Limerick of

today. Pat was first elected to the then Limerick City Council in 1967, at the age of 29,

becoming an Alderman in the process. He was re-elected in subsequent Elections before he

stood down at the 2014 Local Elections.

The Mayor stated that Pat served as Mayor of Limerick on two occasions, in 1974-75 and

again in 1985-86. During his first term, he was involved in the campaign to have the Baggott

Estate in Ballinacurra preserved as a recreational and amenity area, while during his second

term he worked to have Merchant’s Quay designated as an area for urban renewal. This

facilitated the building of a new City Hall, which was now the Council’s Corporate

Headquarters.

In 2007, he achieved the rare distinction of completing 40 years on Limerick City Council and

the longest period of service of any Mayor of Limerick since 1842. Pat was also the last

Alderman in the history of Limerick City as the title was subsequently abolished by the

Government.---

National and Regional Shared Services Directorate

National Broadband Ireland - Presentation by Mr. Donal Hanrahan, National Broadband

Ireland

The Mayor welcomed Dr. Mihai Bilauca, Head of Digital Strategy and Broadband Officer,

Limerick City and County Council, Mr. Donal Hanrahan, Chief Operations Officer, and Ms. Nicola

Cooke, Head of Communications, National Broadband Ireland, in relation to the rollout of rural

broadband in County Limerick.

Mr. Hanrahan provided the Members with an overview of National Broadband Ireland’s

commitment to future-proofing internet access in rural Ireland, using fibre technologies to enable a

truly limitless connected society and economy for generations to come and eliminating Ireland’s

digital divide. He stated that the services would be available to 100% of the NBP’s intervention area,

which accounted for 23% of the population – in approximately 536,000 homes, farms, schools and

businesses. The intervention or rollout area only applied in places which were categorised in the

‘Amber’ area in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment

broadband.gov.ie map.

Mr. Hanrahan outlined that this critical communications infrastructure would play a key role

in sustaining rural Ireland and more remote communities, enabling remote working, e-health

initiatives, online education, job creation, agri-tech, access to e-government services, and would

help reap tourism benefits, growth of SMEs, new start-ups, and foster entrepreneurship. Mr.

Hanrahan also stated that this would lead to increased social inclusion and digital literacy through

community hubs, and it would assist Ireland’s Climate Action Plan by helping to reduce fossil fuel

consumption.

Mr. Hanrahan outlined that the deployment phase would consist of 74,000km of new fibre.

Around 90% of network deployment would be overhead, and 10% underground, and would be

rolled out by utilising existing EIR and ENET infrastructure (existing poles and ducts) which would

reduce the amount of new construction required in each county. He confirmed that only 12% of

deployment of the network would involve new construction (of poles and ducts). Mr. Hanrahan also

presented to Members the high level design for Limerick City and County and showed Q1-Q3 2020

as the indicative timeline for the network design phase in Limerick.

The presentation was concluded by Dr. Bilauca by outlining to Members nine Broadband

Connection Points (BCPs) which would be accessible to the public for free high-speed internet access

in 2020. These would be in the rollout area and included locations such as Knockadea, Mungret,

Coolcappa, Loughill etc. BCP locations included schools, GAA halls, community centres and

enterprise hubs. Dr. Bilauca highlighted that public consultation and engagement with the local

communities was a key aspect in the National Broadband Plan rollout in Limerick. He also outlined

the 2019-Q3 Broadband statistics and confirmed the members of the Limerick Broadband Steering

Group.---

Members thanked Mr. Hanrahan and Dr. Bilauca for their comprehensive presentation and

welcomed the rollout of the National Broadband Plan (NBP). Members raised the following issues:

 Members asked if the rollout could commence in the county area and if the technology would

be fit-for-purpose at the end of the project.

Mr. Hanrahan confirmed that the fibre network being rolled out as part of the NBP was future-

proofed and it would take into account potential future technological developments. The project

had commenced and it was envisaged that the installation in the first area would be completed

by year-end.

 Members queried if properties in the rural areas between towns would receive high-speed

broadband as part of this rollout.

Mr. Hanrahan confirmed that the contract was to deliver broadband to 100% of the premises

and NBI was contractually obliged to meet this target.

 Members emphasised the importance of the communication of this rollout to the business

community and requested a detailed report to be communicated as part of the public

consultation process.

Ms. Cooke confirmed to Members that a comprehensive communication plan was being

developed and would be implemented in a structured way.

 Members queried if a Public Representatives Help Desk could be established.

Mr. Hanrahan said he would revert with this request to the Department of Communications,

Climate Action and Environment.

 Members referred to the option of fibre versus copper lines.

Mr. Hanrahan confirmed that National Broadband Ireland would be using fibre for the majority

of the rollout; however, a small percentage would be served by a different technology.

 Members referred to the cost of the service.

Mr. Hanrahan confirmed that there would be a wholesale provider at a cost of €30 per month

and individual service providers would add on their own charges.

Dr. Bilauca noted the comments and concerns expressed by the Members and emphasised

the importance of the National Broadband Plan to ensure connectivity to every household. In his

role as Broadband Officer for Limerick City and County, he would liaise between the public, the

Elected Members and various organisations, contractors and sub-contractors to co-ordinate a

successful rollout of NBP in the City and County of Limerick.---

Raising of Loan Facility for the Local Authority Public Lighting Energy Efficiency

Project – Southern Region

Circulated, report of the Director, Physical Development, dated 16th January, 2020, seeking

the Council’s approval to the raising of a loan facility to fund the Local Authority Public Lighting

Energy Efficiency Project – Southern Region.

A PowerPoint Presentation was delivered by the Director, Physical Development, briefing

the Members on the Local Authority Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project, outlining the following

key points:

Limerick City and County Council formed part of the Southern Region in conjunction with

Clare County Council, Kerry County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County

Council. He confirmed that the project was being rolled out regionally and that local authorities

were participating in this project to achieve 2020 and 2030 energy efficiency targets, cost savings

and to phase out the use of SOX and SON lights. The project proposal was a Regional Design and

Build Project, with a Lead Authority, to retrofit Public Lights to energy efficient LED Lanterns. The

lead authority in the Southern Region was Cork County Council. The project also included provision

for the replacement of unsafe non-ESBN Columns which would be financed through Housing

Finance Agency loans to each Local Authority. As part of this project, an Asset Condition Survey

would also be completed.---
12

The Director, Physical Development, outlined to the Members the estimated project costs

and savings that could be achieved and through the funding mechanisms available. He confirmed

to Members that approval of a loan facility of €12,918,528 was required which could achieve on

average annual savings over 10 years, after loan repayments including interest, a total of

€200,000.00. The Director, Physical Development, stated that the lifecycle of the project was 20

years and a loan payback period of 15 years.

The Mayor thanked the Director for his presentation and the Members raised the following

issues:

 Members referred to the existing timeframe for the repair of a public light and the significant

cost for this service.

 Members referred to Cork County Council as lead authority and the rationale for this.

The Director confirmed that the project would be completed on a shared service basis in order

to achieve economies of scale and value for money. He also confirmed that there was Climate

Action Fund funding available to participating local authorities. It equated to approx. €1 million

for Limerick City and County Council.

 Members queried if Limerick contractors would be eligible to apply for the contracts.

All contracts would be subject to procurement and all eligible contractors would be able to

apply.

 Members referred to the timeframe for the project and if it could be completed over a shorter

period of time.

The Director confirmed that approximately 100,000 lights would be replaced in Region 1 in a

single contract and was estimated to take approx. two years to complete.

Proposed by Councillor Galvin;

Seconded by Councillor Donegan;

And Resolved:

“That, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government

and in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, the approval

of the Council be and is hereby given to the raising of a loan in the amount of €12,918,528, to fund

the Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project – Southern Region, this loan to be financed through the

Housing Finance Agency.”

Local Authority Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project – Southern Region –

Section 85 Agreement

Circulated, report of the Director, Physical Development, dated 16th January, 2020, seeking

the Council’s approval to the making of an Agreement with Cork County Council, under Section 85

of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, for the proposed Local Authority Public Lighting

Energy Efficiency Project – Southern Region.---
13

The Director, Physical Development, referred to his presentation on the Local Authority

Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project and, as Limerick formed part of the Southern Region, a

Section 85 Agreement was required to progress the project.

The Members raised the following issues:

 Members sought clarification from the Director in relation to the contract and the extent of the

Section 85 Agreement and what that entailed for Limerick in this project.

The Director confirmed that Cork County Council, as lead authority, would be acting on behalf

of Limerick City and County Council and would be liaising with the local authority on an ongoing

basis in relation to contract specifics within Limerick City and County.

 Members referred to the procurement and if local contractors would be eligible for contracts.

The Director confirmed that the project threshold, in line with public procurement, would

require the tender to be placed on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) and E-

tenders and confirmed that any eligible contractor would be entitled to apply.

 Members also referred to the cost of the light replacement to date and the comparative

costings.

The Director confirmed that it was difficult to ascertain a definitive cost and the cost of

installation for each light differed due to variables such as location, health and safety

requirements, traffic management and associated works.

Councillor Benson proposed a deferral of this item pending receipt of further information

and her proposal was seconded by Councillor Costelloe. Following a show of hands, this proposal

was defeated.

Proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon;

Seconded by Councillor Galvin;

And Resolved:

“That, pursuant to Section 85 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, Limerick City

and County Council hereby agrees to enter into an Agreement with Cork County Council whereby

Cork County Council will carry out all of the functions of Limerick City and County Council in respect

of the Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project - South West Region, with the exception of obtaining

any necessary planning approvals and undertaking public consultation procedures as required under

the Planning and Development Acts and Regulations; and it is hereby Resolved under Section 85 of

the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, to enter into this Agreement with Cork County

Council for the provision of the services as outlined above.”

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed breakdown of expenditure relating to Limerick Council***

***Christmas festivities in 2019.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council supports Christmas festivities in a number of ways

– programmes of festive activities, including “Light up Limerick” and “Christmas in

Limerick,” a multi-media campaign to promote Limerick, the provision of Christmas

Festive Lighting and free car-parking. “Christmas in Limerick” was launched in

November with a programme of hundreds of events across Limerick City and County.

The “Christmas in Limerick” festivities culminated on December 31st, with a family-

friendly New Year’s Eve Fireworks Display at 7pm.

Limerick Tourism, Culture and Arts Department oversaw the programme of activities

for 2019 “Light Up Limerick” Event, the provision of Christmas trees in the City and

some “Christmas in Limerick” activations, and the spend was €117,626. The spend

on the New Year’s Eve Fireworks was €55,430.

The Marketing and Communications Department managed the design, printing and

distribution of the “Christmas in Limerick” brochure and complemented this with a

multi-media campaign to promote Limerick as a destination for festive shopping and

activities over an eight-week period. The campaign included social, digital, radio,

print and press and the spend was €46,908. New “Christmas in Limerick” marketing

initiatives for 2019 included collaborations with the University of Limerick, Limerick

Milk Market, Dublin Coach, Limerick Chamber and the Irish Independent, all of which

were Free.

There were collaborative marketing opportunities with Fáilte Ireland, which were

also availed of at no cost.

NOTICES OF MOTION

The Mayor indicated that a supplementary item – Item No. 11A - had been added to the

agenda as follows:

11A

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas **(to be referred to Metropolitan**

**District Meeting)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council approve the submission made late last year to***

***the Development Fund Allocations for 2020 for the Mt. St. Oliver Graveyard Perimeter Works,***

***given that the previous submission made for 2018 was declined and given the ongoing serious***

***safety concerns around the graveyard.***

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Cemetery Committees be given ownership and responsibility***

***for management and maintenance of their local graveyards where it is deemed in the interest of***

***rural communities.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Scanlan. There was no Seconder for the Motion.---
18

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**(to be referred to Protocol Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council formally recognise the local***

***Women’s Caucus. This*** ***organisation is a bipartisan group of female Elected Councillors, whose***

***membership is committed to ensuring that female members are supported in the Local***

***Government system. It will be the first recognised at Local Government level and, in doing so, will***

***ensue Members get the support required in political life.***

It was noted that this Motion had been discussed at the Party Leaders’ meeting held earlier

in the day and that Councillor Kiely wished to amend the Motion by removing the word ‘bipartisan.’

In proposing the amended Motion, Councillor Kiely acknowledged that this was a historic

day for Limerick, once again leading the way by supporting this Motion. She referred to the future

of Local Government with increased female representation and the importance of supporting

female Councillors to remain in political life.

The amended Motion was seconded by Councillor Benson.

The Members expressed support in the establishment of the Women’s Caucus and wished

them well in their endeavours. Members referred to the lack of gender balance on the Council and

acknowledged the contribution that the female Elected Members made to the previous Council.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council seek an independent review***

***into the roll-out of 5G as to whether it has any effect on Human Health and the Environment.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor Galvin.

The Head of Digital Strategy and EU Programmes referred to an independent review on the

Environmental Protection Agency website and confirmed that 5G posed no threat to humans or the

environment. He also confirmed that no concerns had been raised from IT/Digital Institutions over

the last number of years.

Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that he was satisfied that 5G posed no threat to human health

or to the environment.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council provide a direct public reps’ support desk, for***

***example, like Irish Water, as the current system is ineffective; also that reps made by Councillors***

***to various departments contact should be made directly by phone or Email as the Sugar system is***

***not working from my point of view.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).---
19

**REPLY:**

In relation to a direct line, we will provide a dedicated phone number for the

Members. This line will get priority within the Council’s call centre and the Members

will be advised as soon as this is available.

In relation to the SugarCRM system, it was established to ensure continuity of service

and to give a single point of contact in terms of case management.

In response to issues raised by Elected Members, Corporate Services, Customer

Services and Digital Services Departments are working on improvements to the

overall service delivered from SugarCRM and *My Limerick* in terms of improved case

management, better response times and improving the quality of responses.

One recent key improvement has been the establishment of Account Managers as a

point of contact for Members. Their key role is improving response times and quality

of responses. Also, email responses from *My Limerick* have now been personalised

and issues highlighted by Elected Members regarding opening links in email

notifications from *My Limerick* have also been resolved.

We have also taken into account feedback from Members on the CRM system over

the last few months and we are prioritising improvements to allow a more user-

friendly experience.

Councillor Galvin welcomed the direct line for Public Representatives in order to represent

their constituents.

Members also welcomed the direct line for Public Representatives and acknowledged the

upgrade in the Sugar CRM system and the Account Managers.

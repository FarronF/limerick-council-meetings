Proposed by Cilr Mitchell, seconded by Cllr Teefy and agreed that the Meetings
Administrator would, on behalf of the Elected Members, write to Shannon Doc outlining

8. Question submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

| will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for an
update on Oola /Carrigmore water supply and results of any exploration for new water
sources in the area.

Reply:

The Question was referred to Irish Water and their response received on the 19" June, 2020
is as follows:

| have received an update advising that the Oola water supply is currently in drought status,
with yields at the spring, which supplies the area, having fallen back due to the prolonged
dry spell. As a result, it has been necessary to introduce night-time restrictions to allow
reservoir levels to recover overnight. Communications have also been issued via local media
and other channels to encourage the community to conserve water where possible in order
to reduce demand on the supply.

In addition to this, leak detection and repair work is ongoing to find and fix leaks in the
network. The lifting of a Do Not Consume notice for the neighbouring Carrigmore supply last
month has also led to a small increase in the volume of water available for supply, as part of
this area was being supplied from Oola while the restriction was in place.

Further process optimisation works are planned in both Pallasgreen and Oola to maximise
the yield from the ground water sources in these areas and to increase resilience during
long dry spells such as we are currently experiencing.

9. Question submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

| will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for an
update on the request for continuous white lining along the N24 at Pallasgreen, leading to
the junction with the L5050 and the lining of the same junction.

Transport Infrastructure Ireland (Til) were contacted by Limerick City and County Council on
the 12" March 2020 regarding the above issue. TIl responded and recommended that: “as
there is no need to prevent overtaking other than on approach to this junction, the lining
should be out of the double system, with overtaking in each direction banned on approach
to the junction but permitted when leaving the junction”. TIl have agreed that these works
are necessary and we await a commencement date from TIl to undertake these works.

10. Question submitted by Councillor Carey

| will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock can Limerick
City and County Council investigate the possibility of providing a Disabled Parking Space
near St Ailbe’s Credit Union in Hospital on the Main Street.

Reply:
Limerick City and County Council are currently undertaking works in Hospital. This will
involve the installation of a Disabled Parking Space on the street directly opposite the Credit

Union. The location of a Disabled Parking Space cannot be facilitated outside the Credit
Union, as there is no parking allowed on that side of the road

11. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

| will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for an
update on remedial works on the surface water pipe in the river Loobagh being used as a
storm overflow from the public sewer at the rear of Deebert Close, Kilmallock.

Reply:

The Question was referred to Irish Water and their response received on the 19™ June, 2020
is as follows:

As you know Water Services, as a result of a complaint, inspected the foul network in the
area known as Deebert Park in Kilmallock on 10/03/2020. An overflow in a manhole to the
rear of house No. 9 Deebert Place was identified.

emaiihariindin the mesrlif in land tooBesh River, preverding't Waste Water backing up
and flooding Irish Water customers and public lands.

Further investigation revealed that the cause of this overflow discharge to river was as a
direct result of a partial network blockage further downstream.

Water Services Operatives later that evening removed a significant amount of debris and
unblocked this sewer. It is my understanding that the sewer is now functioning as designed
and that overflow discharges to the river have now ceased.

To prevent future debris discharging to the Loobagh river in time of extreme flooding and or
blockage, it is proposed to submit a design and scope of works to Irish Water with a view to
securing funding for the installation of a screened overflow.

Please note that any such works will not be possible until such time as the floodwaters have
receded and funding is made available.

This concluded the Meeting.

Cathaoirleach

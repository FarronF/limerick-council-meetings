incredible Cathaoirleach, if elected. He said she was from Janesboro and was well known and

respected and very active in the community there. He acknowledged Councillor Kiely’s late mother,

area and is the new Co-Ordinator for Queen of Peace Youth Group. Councillor Butler said that

*Mayor , fellow Cllrs , members of the Executive, friends and family, and members of the press*

*Firstly thank you to the people of Limerick who this time last year elected me . 12 short months later*

*I stand here as Cathaoirleach of the Metropolitan area. Thank you to my Fine Gael colleagues and*

*my other Council colleagues. Two years ago if someone had told me this would be happening I*

*wouldn’t*

*have*

*believed*

*them.*

*I feel so proud and privileged to be in this role with my Dad Martin , my daughter Emily and my son*

*Tiernan all here today to support me. The last two years have been very tough on us all.There are*

*two very important people missing, my late husband Damien and my late mother Aileen who I know*

*are looking down at me too.*

*The last few months have been challenging for individuals, families, communities and the country as*

*we all grapple with Covid 19. My message to you today is keep going - no matter what life throws at*

*you. Have a goal and be brave! The road is never straight , it is meandering and sometimes rocky.*

*Life events will bring you on detours the is important to keep your resolve.*

*I’m often asked how I got into politics. My response is, serendipity and pride in Limerick**. Ive always*

*lived here and know the city like the back of my hand .I was educated here and raised my family*

*here, I worked as a chef for nearly 20 years in the private sector and the public sector with TUSLA;*

*Ive always worked in the city , it is an integral part of who I am. I remember being in school in*

*Presentation in Sexton Street , waiting for the Mayor to visit us, I remember the red robes , the gold*

*chain , and the anticipation of his or her arrival , it was the first interaction with local politics for*

*many people. From that day I aspired to be in the role, I always had the robes but not I also have the*

*role!*

*Volunteers are the backbone of Limerick . Not long ago I volunteered with Limerick youth service and*

*Limerick city community radio , one of my first achievements after my election was finding the*

*station their home in Tait place with the help of the executive. I got so much from my time with them*

*I would encourage anyone with free time to give it ago, radio is part of who we are and is a very*

*reliable source of news , we as a nation listen to more radio that most other countries. It is Team*

*Limerick Clean up which has given our City and County national recognition together with the*

*coaches in the soccer clubs , GAA clubs , rugby clubs who volunteer their time to help others in the*

*community. To the volunteers in the youth clubs, mental health support services and arts*

*organizations, I thank you for all that you do. Time is so valuable, anyone who gives their time to*

*others , I commend you.* *It is often said that Limerick’s biggest asset are its people and I totally with*

*that statement . Civic pride is very strong in Limerick and that has been evident in the last few*

*months. Billy and Andrew Grieves are a great example of that . They took it upon themselves to clean*

*up*

*the*

*shores*

*of*

*the*

*Shannon*

*and*

*we*

*commend*

*you*

*for*

*that.*

*The meals on wheels groups throughout Limerick city who were invaluable in helping the most*

*vulnerable people get a hot meal every day, I saw first hand how vital that was in St Munchins during*

*the initial Covid 19 period , well done to you all. I will continue to lend my support the voluntary*

*sector*

*in*

*Limerick*

*during*

*my*

*year*

*as*

*Cathaoirleach*

*The skyline of Limerick will change in the coming year. Cranes will be visible and investment*

*apparent. The Rugby Experience has a crane onsite as we speak. The Opera Development which is*

*a transformational project for the city will be starting in September 2020 and on completion with be*

*capable of employing 3000 people across its 450,000 square feet. Cleves Riverside Quarter will also*

*progress substantially over the next 12 months. The project team led by Limerick 2030 will be*

*preparing a shortlist of concepts for the site in Autumn. It will involve significant public consultation*

*to ensure the local community, and the wider public are afforded the opportunity to provide*

*feedback on the evolving plan for this site, please get involved and have your say when the time*

*comes.*

*The Metropolitan area of which we are the local government, must provide unwavering support to*

*all of our citizens. Politics is for the many not just the few, we need more diversity, That means*

*something different to everyone, when I look around the chamber today , I see people from all parties*

*and none who do work together, most of the time. Building a new Limerick is now our focus. We*

*need to respect each other , work together & compromise to allow everyone to be heard. This*

*paramount going forward. To do this Elected members & the Executive must provide clear and*

*transparent*

*civic*

*leadership*

*in*

*all*

*decision*

*making.*

*We are in unprecedent times. The ongoing impact of Covid 19, and the potential impact of Brexit,*

*are having a massive impact on all of us*

*-businesses and communities alike.*

*Balance is key to re- opening our City. I intend to listen , engage, and work with all parties,*

*organizations and businesses who want our City to thrive. As I said before, our people are our biggest*

*asset. We have people of such passion, energy, ability and drive in our City, often with differing view*

*points. Difference makes us stronger as we gain knowledge from* *other people’s perspective By*

*listening, discussing ,negotiating and compromising we will find a path forward that benefits*

*everyone, not just a few. We will fight-and disagree, but we should always respect each other*

*because we will always agree on one thing, we love our City.*

*Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to working with you all in the coming year.*

*Ar aghaidh linn Le Cheile . Ill leave you with this quote for consideration ,*

*“I have never in my life learned anything from someone who agreed with me “* *(Dudley Field Malone)*

**Strategic Housing Development Application at Walkers Lane, Annacotty, Limerick**

Mr. S. Duclot, A/Senior Planner, was present to deliver a presentation on the proposed

development at Walkers Lane, Annacotty, Limerick. The Cathaoirleach asked the meeting if there

was a need to have this presentation given that the presentation had already been delivered at

local area electoral briefings. Councillor Butler proposed that the presentation not be given and

that the meeting should move instead to questions in relation to the development. This was

seconded by Councillor Kiely and agreed.

Members then discussed various concerns they had in relation to the proposed development at

Walkers Lane which included:

 Main concern is density, density is higher than set out in the Castletroy Local Area Plan and

higher relative to other recent planning applications in the area.

 Residents have raised concerns in relation to excavation, noise, large construction vehicles.

 Concerns regarding height of 3 to 5 stories, two storeys not permitted along the road historically.

 Visual impact on existing estates, potential overlooking issues of existing properties, inaccuracies

in terms of assessment /survey drawings.

 Outside 15 mins walk to UL/Castletroy Shopping Centre

 Playground – more recreational facilities needed in the area.

 Parking is deficient

 Concerns regarding levels of traffic generated and a single access point to development

 Accessed off a narrow road ( Walkers Lane)

 Consideration in relation to the recorded monuments on site

Mr. S Duclot then addressed some of the concerns above, stating that Limerick City and County

Council were not the deciding authority, and that the purpose of his presence was to outline the

proposed development to Members. He also outlined that the pre-planning process had been

completed in full. Mr. Duclot stated that all amendments and observations will be taken on board

***during the Covid 19 period; how many complaints of illegal dumping have been received and how***

***many have been resolved.***

**REPLY:** The amount of waste collected from the 17th March 2020 to the 31st April 2020 weighted

141.28 tonnes. This weight includes illegal dumping, street sweepings and waste collected from

litter bins. Data for May is not yet available from the waste contractor. There were 354 illegal

***Upper Carey’s Road (“The Quarry” side) hasn’t been done. Can the Council explain why and***

***advise when they will overlay this side of the road.***

**REPLY:** I refer to works carried out at Upper Carey’s Road in 2017 and 2018, which entailed

extensive restoration improvement, and footpath works on Upper Carey’s Road.

The Upper Carey’s Road (Quarry side) is 150m long approximately by 5m wide and would cost

€30,000 to surface with stone mastic asphalt surfacing.

I accept that works are required on the Quarry side and these works could be completed in 2020 if

there is adequate budgets available at the end of the year, if not this will be included for 2021

Restoration Improvement Scheme.

***measures were installed to ensure compliance.***

**REPLY:** The Special Speed Limit Bye-Laws were adopted at the full meeting of the Council on the

23rd September 2019 with the 1st November being the date the bye-laws came into effect. Speed

limits were installed where required on the non-national road network by Limerick City and County

Council Operations staff and on the National Road network by Contractors for Transport

Infrastructure Ireland. All Special Speed Limits contained in the current Bye-Laws, including the

30Kph Special Speed Limits are in place.

The introduction of 30 Kph Special Speed Limits in housing estates is a specific programme funded

annually by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that includes for the installation of

30Kph and “Slow Zone” signage. Physical traffic calming measures do not form part of the

programme.

It should be noted that additional 30kph Special Speed Limits will be introduced in more housing

**REPLY:** Limerick Twenty Thirty is managing the redevelopment of the Cleeves Site and is currently

in the procurement process for a team that will be appointed to develop a masterplan for

the Cleeves Riverside Quarter.  The site is zoned 'City Centre Area' in the City Development Plan

which means it’s suitable for several uses including commercial, residential and educational.  There

may be opportunities for community usage before the construction begins on some of the site but

currently there is Covid-19 / isolation housing accommodation by the HSE on the site.

***I will ask at the next meeting what measurements and assessments are used by Council to***

**REPLY:** Measurement of the performance of the city centre can fall under a number of different

headings; economic performance, trading data, physical infrastructure, traffic measurement,

footfall counters, social, cultural and civic activities, commercial occupancy rates, etc.

The Council monitor information relating to specific city centre activities to inform them on specific

Council initiatives and would periodically publish such data e.g. the Limerick Economic Monitor,

Traffic Flow Data, Air Quality, Vacancy Rates, etc. The data and information collected is used by the

Council in framing policy and strategic decision making e.g. Development Plan, Air Quality Plan,

Festivals and Events Strategy, etc.

Other data is available from NOAC, who publish annual KPI’s in relation to its function, scrutinising

Local Authority performance against relevant indicators and from the Central Statistics Office who

***City and County Council against this and refusing to collect the rubbish that is bagged and the***

***Council asking the public not to clean their area. In this unprecedented time this is the only***

***activity that some people have in their area. Can this activity be allowed.***

**REPLY**: As a result of social restrictions associated with COVID-19 the normal levels of support to

community clean-ups was curtailed to ensure support and respect for compliance with

Government advice. As restrictions ease and communities are expected to be able to mobilise,

Limerick City and County Council will be supportive of such efforts to similar levels as previous

**14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting, to request free car parking for Limerick city to be***

***enacted for one year, when Limerick is ready for reopening (which is now) after this Covid-19***

***pandemic. I believe that to bring footfall back into our city, shoppers should be given 3 hours***

***free car parking at any time of the day to help retailers.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***Shannon Banks, Plassey, Annacotty, Worlds End Castleconnell, The Ferry Castleconnell and Clare***

***Glens.***

In proposing the Motion, Cllr Hartigan referred to the large amount of litter left in/next to bins in

the aforementioned areas and requested that additional refuse bins be provided. He acknowledged

the excellent work being down by the tidy towns groups in these areas. He also spoke of how a lot

of rubbish has been taken home by residents as the bins are full and that some bins have domestic

waste in them.

In supporting Councillor Hartigan, Members asked that the bin collections service be reviewed and

that bins are emptied more frequently. Signage was requested for the recycling centre on the Dock

Road. It was also asked that mobile CCTV be considered for this centre. Concern was also expressed

at the cost of waste collection and disposal. The litter problem in the Peoples Park and on the river

banks, and the need for greater litter enforcement was also referred to. A number of Members

commended the voluntary work cleaning up the riverbed on the North Shannon Bank.

In reply the Director of Service Mr. Lehane thanked members for their contributions and concurred

with a lot of what was outlined. He also confirmed that the bins are serviced at weekends and that

the Council would examine increased bin collections. He added that there are two bin collections

each day in the city centre and that some resources have recently been diverted to the suburbs

due to reduced footfall in the city centre due to Covid-19. He also pointed out that Litter wardens

were very productive and a report was available on the number of fines issued. He commended

the work of the tidy towns and other voluntary groups. He also advised Members that they can let

him know in future if they see particular bins/areas that require attention and that he can divert

resources accordingly.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Benson and agreed.

**16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan** **(to be referred to the Home and Social**

**Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

***and maintain bin records to ensure that litter bins (including dog waste bins) are adequately***

***serviced and maintained and that bins are located in the most appropriate locations to cater for***

***levels of demand. This system should also allow for the public to scan the QR code and report any***

***issues that they might encounter.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment

Strategic Policy Committee.

**18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir** **(to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council introduces a special speed limit of 30kph as a***

***service, in the Metropolitan area and increase collections where necessary.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment

Strategic Policy Committee.

**20. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council, adopt a policy to support local business by***

***purchasing goods and services from Limerick companies, where possible and within the***

***parameters of the procurement process, while still achieving value for money.***
---
9

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council’s Procurement Policy reflects the importance of access

to SME’s in accordance with the EU Procurement Directive but it would not be in-line with the

Directive to have a specific policy which stipulates that local businesses must be supported.

However, while bearing this in mind Limerick City and County Council will endeavor to support

SME’s while seeking to achieve value for money. For Supplies & Services up to €25,000, Consultancy

Services & Public Works up to €50,000 – quotations are sufficient and this provides an opportunity

to examine the local market while adhering to procurement rules. Also, when buyers are

advertising on the tendering sites (eTenders, Supplygov.) they are encouraged, where possible, to

sub-divide contracts into Lots which facilitates SME’s/local suppliers engagement in the market.

Councillor Benson, in proposing the motion, commended the Council on the "Shop Limerick"

campaign, and said it was a wonderful initiative aimed at encouraging people to support local

businesses who need to be supported at this time. She asked that the Council review all suppliers

of goods and services to the Council and switch to local businesses where possible - within the

parameters of the procurement process and existing contracts. She also suggested that, further to

above, the Council should be looking to source local suppliers for all other purchases including

stationary, office supplies, litter bins, materials etc.

In reply to Members, the meeting administrator stated that Limerick City and County Council follow

all procurement and tax guidelines and that tax clearance certs are required.

The motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

**21. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council write to Shannon Group, requesting an urgent***

***meeting with the Council, to discuss the crisis that is unfolding and to take a wider view of the***

***tourism sector across the Mid West and sit down with Limerick City and County Council and***

***unions to see how jobs can be retained.***

**23. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council seek an explanation from Shannon Heritage on***

***why King John’s Castle will only reopen for the period of July 20th to August 31st 2020 giving just***

***a six-week window to encourage leisure tourists, instead of working to extend the season with***

***other providers in the local tourism industry as they try to rebuild following the Covid-19***

***outbreak.***

It was proposed by the Cathaoirleach to deal with Motions 21. and 23. together.

Councillor Costelloe, in proposing this motion, acknowledged the workers from Shannon Heritage

who were seated in the Gallery. He stated that the proposed closure of King John’s Castle at the

end of August would have major financial implications for Limerick and the mid west region. King

John’s Castle is a primary tourist attraction and the closure of the Castle along with Bunratty Castle

would have a knock-on effect on local tourism and businesses. He suggested that these sites should

be removed from Shannon Group and transferred to The Office of Public Works and he proposed

that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht be written to on the matter.
---
10

Councillor O’ Donovan requested a copy of the lease between Limerick City and County Council and

Shannon Heritage that was signed in 1994.

Members enquired how it was proposed to close these sites on August 31st in Limerick and

Bunratty, yet the sites that Shannon Heritage manage in Dublin are to remain open. All Members

joined in supporting the staff of Shannon Heritage. The members called on the Council to write to

CEO of Shannon Group to reverse the decision to close these facilities at the end of August.

Councillor Costelloe thanked Members for their support for this Notice of Motion and asked that a

Special Meeting be called to discuss this matter further.

This Notice of Motion was seconded by Councillor O’ Sullivan and unanimously agreed.

**22. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council calls on the Minister for Social Protection to***

***engage with Debenhams to ensure a just settlement for former Debenhams workers, many who***

***have given over 20 years of their working lives to the Company.***

Councillor Costelloe, in proposing this motion, pointed out that Debenhams closed on 23rd March

2020 with 130 staff affected in Limerick and pointed out that some of the staff had over 30 years

service. Staff were informed of the closure by email on 9th April. He called on the Council to ask

the Minister for Social Protection to engage with Debenhams to ensure a just settlement for former

Debenhams workers.

This Notice of Motion was seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne and unanimously agreed.

**24. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan area to call on the Minister for Finance to***

***reduce the V.A.T. rate in the tourism and hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9% in an effort to***

***support and stimulate the industry during this difficult period.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor McSweeney recalled that in 2011 the Government reduced the

VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% to encourage growth in this sector and that the need for similar action

by the Government is needed now more than ever. He then questioned if a 4% reduction is enough

to support this sector and a larger reduction may need to be considered. He highlighted that the

hospitality sector forms a key part in the Irish Economy and in Limerick’s economy and is worth in

excess of 7.6bn per year to the Irish economy and the sector employs 180,000 people, that it is

important the Government support these businesses as they begin to reopen over the coming

weeks.

Councillor McSweeney then asked that Limerick City and County Council write to the Minister for

Finance out lining the importance of the Tourism and Hospitality Sector not only to Limerick but

the whole mid-west. Councillor O’Sullivan seconded the Motion.

Councillor Sheehan stated that he was opposed to this Motion adding that employers in the

tourism and hospitality sector should pay adequate wages to all workers including seasonal

workers.
---
11

Councillor Benson proposed the following amendment to the Motion;

“...conditional on the Irish Hotel Federation engaging with the Joint Labour Committees process

and the introduction of Employment Regulation Orders”.

Councillor McSweeney agreed to the amendment.

The amendment was seconded by Councillor O’ Donovan and was agreed.

**25. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the Council oppose the***

***decision by Aer Lingus to lay off its Shannon Airport staff, calls on Aer Lingus to commit to***

***retaining cabin crew staff at Shannon and to engage with the Forsa union about their long term***

***strategy for the airport and calls on the newly established Shannon Airport task force to restore***

***24 hour operations at the airport.***

Councillor Sheehan, in proposing this Motion, stated that the Shannon-Heathrow route needs to

be restored and there needs to be capital investment in the mid west region. He expressed concern

that that the region is being actively discriminated against, and that he hoped the new Government

would take Shannon Airport more seriously given the importance of it to the region.

The Motion was seconded by Cllr. Leddin and was agreed.

**26.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was taken as read.

This concluded the Meeting.

Síochána’s Policing Plan is to reflect Limerick issues and what goals it it hoped to achieve. He said it was his

aim that the Limerick Division Policing Plan would be a Policing Plan for all internal and external

stakeholders. He outlined the Garda Decision making Model.

He stated that since early 2019 senior Garda Management have been liaising with senior officials in

Limerick City and County Council in respect of issues of extortion/intimidation at building sites by

companies and in recent months there has been four charges attributed for this crime type. He pointed out

that, at present, An Garda Síochána has no outstanding complaint, however, if any member of the JPC was

The Chief Superintendent thanked the Council for it’s contribution also and stated that this bus will be used

for community purposes. He paid tribute to Inspector Kennedy for his efforts in relation to this project.

**4.Presentation by Detective Garda Declan O’Halloran, Divisional Drugs Unit**

Detective Garda Declan O’Halloran outlined the Drugs Statistics 2019 as follows :

Sale / Supply –

City 156 and County 16

MDA Warrants for Division

236

MDA Searches for Division

2,687

Simple Possession

City 560 and County 45

He added that seven warrants were executed yielding the seizure in total of €410,160 believed to be the

proceeds of drug dealing and three warrants were executed yielding the seizure of three loaded firearms

and accompanying firearms components.

He stated that the Divisional Drug Squad led an operation targeting sale/supply of crack cocaine in the

northside of the city on 8th January 2020. As a result of this operation four persons were arrested and

detained under Drug Trafficking legislation and four persons were charged and are before the courts. He

listed the monetary value of the various drugs seized.

He also gave an overview of drugs statistics for 2020 for the Limerick division and the values of sale/supply

of the controlled substances seized to date in 2020. He outlined the differences between crack cocaine and

cocaine.---
The Chief Superintendent stated that since September there is a deliberate input of drugs into the market

by individuals in the city and is focused directly at the most vulnerable in our society. Alot of work is being

done by An Garda Síochána with the Mid Western Task Force to monitor how big this problem is. The drug

addicts are presenting in a lot worse physical and mental state due to the availability of crack cocaine. A

multi agency approach is needed to address this problem and all are working hard with communities and

various forums. In September the Garda Strategy was put in placed. A lot of work is being done to contain

the drugs problem. Intelligence led high impact operation was carried out that included all agencies which

yielded results. As a result Exclusion Orders were sought and Gardai liaised with the Council in relation to

Tenancy Agreements. He added that the operation is still ongoing. He said he is determined to get on top

of this problem and stated that he has increased staffing in the Drugs Unit by 50%. He asked Members to

inform the Gardai about any issues that come to their attention.

The Chief Superintendent replied to Members queries as follows :

Gardaí can stop a car and test for drugs if they have reasonable grounds for suspicion e.g. smell,

intelligence, previous history.

He acknowledged that drugs is a problem in the county areas as well as the city and stated that he is

putting in extra resources into the county areas as part of the new operating model. He intends growing

this and said it will be part of the new community policing in areas. He said the Criminal Assets Bureau

(CAB) are working hard to combat the problem of drugs and all information received is sent to CAB. He

referred to the mental and physical problems that arise from the use of drugs, the effects of which will be

seen down the road. He confirmed that An Garda Síochána has a Schools Programme which involves

Gardaí going into primary schools and speaking to students about various items and drug use would be

broadly discussed. However, he said the Department of Education has made it clear that this is their

responsibility but added the Gardaí are happy to help. He confirmed that there is a dog in the Drugs Unit in

Limerick who is trained in drug detection and public order. He stated that drugs can show up in your

system three weeks after use and it was important to make people aware of this. He added that medicated

drugs must also be taken into consideration when testing. He said community information and

involvement is invaluable in combatting the drugs problem. He added that the problem of drugs is not just

in Limerick, it is a national problem.

He said that increased garda resources will be in place in the county within the next few days along with

Drugs Unit. The Gardaí carry out operations in licensed premises to check for underage drinking and drug

testing can also be carried out here. However, he said the onus is on the owners of licensed premises to

take appropriate steps to ensure there are no drugs being sold or used on their premises. He said under

the new Garda operating model the whole county will be based in Newcastle West, however, this will not

affect the policing in the east of the county and services will not change. The purpose is to strengthen

community engagement. He said he would have figures on the number of ASBOS issued for the next

meeting. Also applications are being made to the Courts for Exclusion Orders and tenancies are also taken

into consideration in relation to combating drugs.

The Chief Executive informed members that regular meetings occur with the Gardaí and measures in

relation to a joint approach in tackling the drugs issue is one of the critical items that is discussed.

**5.Presentation by Mr. Seamus Hayes, Housing Service Officer, on Community Sustainment/Estate**

**Management**

The Housing Service Officer gave a detailed presentation on Community Sustainment / Estate

Management.

He replied to Members queries as follows :

There are four Community Sustainment Officers and the Unit has a team based approach with the aim of

encouraging and supporting members of the community to engage with the Council and other agencies and

to become actively involved and acquire a sense of ownership of their estates.

This is a service where trust is established and maintained through good communication and all

information received is dealt with confidentially.---
Allegations of criminal behaviour are a matter for investigation in the first instance by An Garda SÍochána

who is the Council’s key partner in trying to curb anti social behaviour. Many issues can be resolved by

talking to people, however, in more serious cases a series of measures may apply ranging from verbal

warnings, to written warnings, to statutory written warnings and ultimately issuing of proceedings in

District Court. Court application may be for repossesion of house or issuing of excluding order against

offenders.

He added that Council tenants are obliged to keep children under control. However, any issues in relation

to children are dealt with by Tusla.

He stated that tenants housed under HAP or RAS are not the responsibility of the Council.

**6.** **Question submitted by Councillor Michael Murphy:**

“I will ask at the next Meeting, as an aid to policing within the city centre, do CCTV cameras continue to be

monitored at Henry Street Garda Station and has there been any reduction in the level of monitoring in the

past year”.

In reply, the Chief Superintendent stated that staff in this area has been reduced, however cameras can be

tracked and manipulated.

This concluded the Meeting.

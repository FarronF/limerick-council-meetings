QUESTIONS

5.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for the following updates (a) reason for the delay in works for***

***Wards Cross and Devon Road Cross, (b) reason for the delay in works for Cryle View estate***

***junction entrance (c) update on the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan with regard to***

***road layout, traffic lights, additional parking, start dates for the works, overall cost of***

***project and availability of funding (d) update on Colbert Terrace proposed housing***

***development (e) update on the proposed location of a public toilet for Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

**(a)**

**N21 Wards Cross**

N21 Wards Cross was identified as having a high collision rate under TII’s HD15

Network Safety Analysis Process. Wards Cross is the junction of the N21 national road

with the L7091 local road. Mid West National Road Design Office have followed TII’s

procedure for considering HD15 sites and the necessary steps are broadly outlined

below.

Following TII’s identification of the site, it was further analysed by staff from Mid West

National Road Design Office and a feasibility report was prepared recommending the

installation of a right turn lane on the N21 at Wards Cross. TII accepted the findings

and recommendations of this feasibility report and approved for Limerick City and
---
4

County Council to procure technical advisors to progress the design to the next stage

of the process.

Following a procurement process, Barry Transportation were appointed as technical

advisors to carry out a detailed design of the right turn lane at N21 Wards Cross. To

progress the detailed design a ground investigation and topographical survey have

been carried out. These were subsequently procured and undertaken.

A number of design issues arose from retrofitting a right turn lane into an existing road

layout. These issues included the carriageway alignment, the location of properties in

the vicinity of the junction, the topography of the surrounding land, the existing road

surface drainage and the presence of a water main. Many of these issues do not

conform to current road design parameters and will require departure from standards

from TII.

The technical consultants have worked to refine the design and remove as many

departures from standards as possible by means of a workshop and consultations with

the Road Design Office and TII Safety and Pavement sections. This process has been

largely successful but a number of issues still require a departure from standards. The

issues of the surface water drainage and the water main required consultation with

the Water Services Section of Limerick City and County Council and Irish Water.

Barry Transportation, have progressed the detailed design for the right turn lane and

have produced design drawings and a cost estimate for the proposed works. These

were submitted to TII for their comment and comments have been considered. We

are endeavouring to finalise the design process and seek TII approval to proceed to

preparation of tender documents. In order to complete the design process the

following stages are required to be completed; Road Safety Audit, Departures

Application, Preliminary Design Report and further consultations with Irish Water and

investigations of the water main to inform the extent of diversion of the water main

required.

**N21 Devon Cross**

Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) highlighted this junction as having potential

safety issues under the TII HD17 Road Safety Inspection (RSI) Process. Two safety

issues were identified as part of the RSI Process and the inspection team

recommended feasibility stage solutions. Mid West National Road Design Office have

followed the process for dealing with HD17 sites and this is described below.

Following identification and notification of the site by TII, staff from Mid West National

Road Design Office (MWNRDO) carried out a further assessment of this location and

the safety issues raised. MWNRDO recommended to TII that initial design stage

solutions be advanced and that technical engineering consultancy services be

procured to carry this out. TII approved funding for the appointment of these

engineering consultancy services.
---

Following a procurement process, Barry Transportation were appointed to carry out

initial design stage solutions for N21 Devon Cross and, subject to TII approval, a

detailed design solution and tender stage services.

Barry Transportation progressed the initial design stage solutions and part of this

process was to carry out a topographical survey and a traffic survey. These were

subsequently procured and undertaken.

Following design development and workshops with TII and staff from Mid West

National Road Design Office, Barry Transportation have submitted a feasibility report

for the N21 Devon Cross junction and the report outlines three options that have been

developed for the junction and recommends the option to create a staggered junction

by realigning the local road north of the N21, the L7059 that commences at Buckley’s

Shop, to the east of Devon Cross.

This report has been submitted to TII for approval of the recommendation in the

finalised feasibility report and allocation of the necessary funding. We are

endeavouring to secure this funding to allow Barry Transportation to proceed with the

detail design process and preparation of tender documents.

**(b)**

The proposed works at the Cryle View estate are subject to approval and sanctioning

of funding from TII. As previously noted, LCCC has submitted all necessary

documentation to TII for consideration. It is expected that TII will revert in the coming

weeks. Once approval is sanctioned, LCCC will proceed with the construction works

as soon as is practicable.

**(c)**

Works are progressing on the design of the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan. The

pedestrian counts to determine the locations of pedestrian crossing points had to be

deferred due to Covid-19. Drawings are being prepared for the additional parking to

the rear of Main Street and discussions are ongoing with the owners of lands affected.

The scheme will be presented to Councillors when the layout has been finalised and

the scheme costs will be submitted to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for funding.

The start date for the scheme is likely to be Q1 2021.

**(d)**

The proposed housing development at Colbert Terrace, Abbeyfeale was revised

following the Part 8 process with the proposed number of new units reduced from 6

no. to 3 no. This reduction in unit numbers impacts on the overall cost per unit and

necessitates revised funding approval. Limerick City and County Council continue to

engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on this

scheme. Subject to revised funding approval this project is scheduled to progress to

construction stage in Q4 2020.

**(e)**

The provision of civil works and services for the proposed toilet in Abbeyfeale is

included in the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan. The proposed location of the

public toilet is in the new car park to be constructed at O’Riordan’s.

Councillor Galvin expressed disappointment at the responses outlined above in relation to
---

Wards Cross, Devon Cross and Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan and to the length of

time taken to progress these matters. He also noted that there was no one present from the

Road Design Office to discuss the projects at Wards Cross and Devon Cross and he had

requested this at the March meeting.

In reply, the Meetings Administrator advised that due to the current Covid 19 restrictions

and guidance, only the required attendees were currently being invited to attend meetings.

However she did state that personnel from the Road Design Office would be invited to

attend a District meeting at a later date to discuss Wards Cross and Devon Cross. Also staff

from the Capital Investment Directorate would be invited to discuss the Abbeyfeale Traffic

Management Plan and the proposed housing development at Colbert Terrace.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that while a response was awaited on some projects

within the District from the TII, he did state that works on the N21 at South Quay Newcastle

West were progressed in conjunction with the TII. He also outlined various other funding

which was allocated towards other road improvement works in the District including

pavement improvement works and resurfacing works at Abbeyfeale and Glin.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the proposed Local Authority housing***

***development for Mountcollins.***

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council submitted an application for funding to the

Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) to construct

10 houses in Mountcollins in late 2017. The Department reviewed the

submission but was not in a position to recommend approval of the proposed

scheme citing issues related to lack of access to shops, services and public

transport and low demand. Information on the application and response was

issued to the Newcastle West Municipal District elected members on 3rd

December, 2019.

A further application for funding to construct 7 houses was issued in late 2019

on the basis that 3 houses had subsequently been purchased in Mountcollins.

The DHPLG have reviewed the proposal and have suggested an incremental

build approach with 2-3 units in the first phase subject to further details being

issues. This proposal is currently being reviewed by Limerick City and County

Council.

**QUESTIONS**

**6.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update and timescale for when flood defences are to be***

***installed in Mulcair Drive in Annacotty, Mountshannon Road, Castleconnell and Montpellier to***

***prevent flooding to houses in these areas when the Mulcair and Shannon Rivers flood.***

**REPLY:** Tenders have recently been sought from consultants on the **Limerick City & Environs**

**Flood Relief Scheme.** This Scheme includes Annacotty & Mountshannon Road within it’s Study

Area. Tenders are to be returned in October with appointment of the successful consultant by the

end of 2020. It is expected that Stage 1 of the Project (Options Assessment, Scheme Development

and Design including Environmental Impact Assessment) will take approximately 2 years and

Planning/Development consents will follow this. It is currently estimated that Stage IV

(Construction) will commence in 2025 and will be of 4-5 year duration. It is anticipated that

multiple construction contracts will be undertaken and accordingly the Annacotty / Mountshannon

Road sections of the Scheme may be advanced separate to the city centre construction contracts.

The **Castleconnell Flood Relief Scheme** is currently progressing with Hydraulic Modelling at Final

Draft stage. Costing of Options is also being progressed with Preferred Options to be assessed in

October 2020. A cost beneficial scheme will be progressed through Stage 1 with Planning /

Development consents to follow. It is currently estimated that construction will commence in early

2023, with 7 month construction programme.

The **O’Brien/Montpellier AFA** (Area for Further Assessment) falls within the Clare County Council

Area. It was one of the 300 AFA’s assessed under CFRAM but was not one of the 118 schemes

identified for funding. The summary of the Outputs for Areas identified in the Flood Risk

Management Plans included the AFA as a Potential Scheme subject to further assessment.

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the current and proposed flood relief projects in***

***Corbally and Kings Island and the timeframe for completion for both projects.***

**REPLY**: The **King’s Island Flood Relief Scheme** is currently at Planning Approval Stage. The

current programme estimates a decision will be due from An Bord Pleanála by the end of January

2021. Tendering for contractors will follow the Bord decision, with construction currently

programmed to commence mid July 2021. The estimated construction period is 2 years.

Tenders have recently been sought from consultants on **the Limerick City & Environs Flood Relief**

**Scheme.**  This Scheme includes Corbally within it’s Study Area. Tenders are to be returned in

October with appointment of the successful consultant by the end of 2020. It is expected that

Stage 1 of the Project (Options Assessment, Scheme Development and Design) will take

approximately 2 years and Planning / Development Consents will follow this. It is currently

estimated that Stage IV (Construction) will commence in 2025 and will be of 4 – 5 years duration.

It is anticipated that multiple construction contracts will be undertaken and accordingly the

Corbally section of the Scheme may be advanced separate to the city centre construction

contract.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what funding Limerick City and County Council has received for***

***2020 for the installation of new bus shelters and what locations in the Limerick City East area will***

***benefit from this funding.***

**REPLY**: Funding, in the amount of €160,000, has been secured from the NTA for the 2020 Bus

Shelter Enabling Works Programme. 11 sites across the city (six sites) and county (five sites) have

been identified in collaboration with JCDecaux and Bus Eireann for upgrades in 2020.

Two of the six sites identified in the Metropolitan area to be completed under the 2020 works

programme are located in the Limerick East area - Kilmurry Road at Hazel Hall and Groody Road at

Brookfield Hall (UL bound). Upgrade to the latter shelter has been completed.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many people are employed in the Troy Studios Development***

***and has the social inclusion clause been implemented.***

**REPLY**: Troy Studios is not an associate or subsidiary company of Limerick City and County Council,

and as such, we do not have information on their operations or employee data.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, following on from the allocation of €15,000 from the GMA funding***

***for Metropolitan North in 2018 towards a Corbally Community Park, what progress has been***

***made so far.***
---
6

**REPLY**: The group have engaged with the Forward Planning Department on the matter and as

advised they have opened up further correspondence with the Diocese as they own the field. It is

understood that the Diocese Property Subcommittee have confirmed that the project is due to be

discussed during meetings in September. The Community Park Group are hopeful that by the end

of September/early October they will have a clearer picture on the next steps required.  The Council

will review the matter with the group after they have further clarity from the Diocese.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next meeting what measures have been put in place for safer access to schools***

***(in line with the guidelines from the NTA and the Department of Education and Skills) and request***

***details in relation to contact with schools and supports either given or awaited to these schools.***

**REPLY**: I refer to the above question and the following outlines the measures currently been

undertaken for the Metropolitan area schools;

1. All schools have  social distancing  road markings provided at  appointed school crossing

places.

2. All  schools  will have social distancing  warning signs on  signposts erected at appointed

school crossing  places by  31/09/2020.

3. Four schools have had  pedestrian guard railings altered at  school entrances

following  requests from school authorities.

4. All

pelican

crossing

at

appointed

school

crossing

places  have  had  wintergreen  timings  extended to  accommodate  longer  lines of  children

crossing.

5. All and any additional adult school warden  operating hours necessary to  assist and

enable  altered school  staggered start and finish times  requested by school authorities.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next meeting what consideration is given in the process of the Limerick City and***

***County Council granting planning permissions for new housing developments and in consultation***

***on strategic housing developments to the provision and availability of local education places for***

***early education, primary and secondary education.***

**REPLY**: In the plan making process (Local Area Plans and/or Development Plans) where lands are

identified to be zoned for residential development, consultation with the Department of Education

and Skills takes place to forecast the demand for future school places and the adequacy, or

otherwise, of existing school facilities.

Overall the plan making process and the zoning of land for residential purposes are therefore

fundamentally guided and shaped by the capacity of existing social infrastructure (schools and

community facilities).

Therefore, in assessing a planning application for new housing developments on land zoned for

residential development within an adopted Local Area Plan and/or Development Plan,

consideration is given to the land use zoning matrix which is intended as a guide to assess the

acceptability or otherwise of development proposals. In land zoned residential development,

housing is the primary use and therefore would be acceptable in principle. The issue of provision

and availability of local education places for primary and secondary education has been dealt at an
---
7

early stage during the plan making process.

In relation to early education/childcare facilities, the Childcare Facility Guidelines for Planning

Authorities, Ministerial Guidelines issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act,

2000 (as amended) require the provision of at least one childcare facility for new housing

developments greater than 75 units. There are circumstances where there are significant reasons

to the contrary for example, development consisting of single bed apartments or where there are

adequate childcare facilities in adjoining developments.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on my motion that was passed at the September***

***meeting last year, requesting the installation of a water dispenser in the city centre, in a bid to***

***reduce single use plastic bottles.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council successfully applied for Healthy Ireland Funding to install

a minimum of four public drinking water fountains across Limerick city and county. The Council is

currently identifying a suitable location in Limerick city and three locations outside the city.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask the Council for an update on the progress of Motion passed in October 2019 to***

***livestream Metropolitan Council meetings.***

**REPLY**: The reply to the previous Notice of Motion was as follows :

“*Standing Order number 99 states that ‘no cameras of any kind or sound recordings or*

*communication equipment may be used at Meetings of the Metropolitan District without the prior*

*approval of the Metropolitan District Members, This governs use of mobile phones amongst other*

*matters in the Council chambers during meetings.*

*In order to live stream Council meetings, there are a number of factors that need to be considered*

*such as the existing infrastructure within the Council Chamber, refurbishments costs required to*

*accommodate this retrofitting works and the digital/technical maintenance of providing this*

*service. If the motion is agreed an**examination of the costs, options**and available technologies will*

*be conducted. There are a number of local authorities that allow for live streaming of Council*

*meetings deemed open to the public and we will liaise with these local authorities in relation to*

*procedures, protocols and safeguards that they have in place”.*

Since then, Metropolitan Meetings have moved to the Council Chamber in Dooradoyle to comply

with physical distancing requirements. A tender has commenced for the upgrading of the sound

and video systems in the Council Chamber, Dooradoyle. Details will then be brought to the Protocol

Committee for further consideration and for a decision on whether the relevant Standing Order

will be amended to facilitate live streaming.

**22.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council compiles data on the levels of overcrowding amongst people on the housing list***

***and makes publicly available figures on persons per room, persons per bedroom, and unit square***

***footage per person.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan stated that housing applicants indicate that there are

severe levels of overcrowding. He stated that there are also many people in need of housing who

have not looked for help from the Council. Inadequate housing and overcrowding is having a severe

mental toll on applicants. He said the Council should be renovating vacant houses and reletting

them and buying houses also.

Members supported the motion and reiterated the severity of the housing problem in Limerick and

added that there needs to be significant change in policy at national level.

**REPLY:** The below figures show the number of overcrowded in each Area of Choice, the other

information requested is not available:-

Councillor Hartigan, in proposing the Motion, stated that developers are not aware of the type of

housing required in each area and should work with the Council to meet the needs of the public.

Councillor Benson, in seconding the Motion, said that there is a lack of 1 bedroom accommodation

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney (to be referred to the Climate**

**Action, Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Limerick Metropolitan District**that Limerick City and***

***County Council carry out a full review of the current 2015 Cemetery Bye-Laws.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to The Community, Leisure and Emergency Strategic

Policy Committee.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council moves***
---
12

***to apply for relevant funding to install an additional pedestrian/zebra crossing along the main***

***Corbally Road in the vicinity of Scoil Ide.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan and seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Sheehan said the existing traffic issues are well known on the

main Corbally Road especially in the vicinity of Scoil Ide. More people are now walking and cycling

and it is imperative that they can do so in a safe manner. We are encouraging children to walk to

school however, with no pedestrian/zebra crossing in the vicinity of Scoil Ide it is very difficult for

children to do this.

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council Traffic Department will examine whether or not the

warrants are met for the provision of an additional controlled pedestrian crossing on the Corbally

Road adjacent to Scoil Ide on the R463. Limerick City and County Council is currently of the

view that such a provision is unwarranted on the R463 to service safe road crossing provisions for

school children attending Scoil Ide as two adult school wardens are currently assigned to

the R463 at Scoil Ide .

Provision of such a facility on the Mill Road adjacent to the school entrance is more likely to meet

the warrants and this will be examined by the Limerick City and County Council Traffic Department.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, Councillor Daly proposed a Notice of Motion which was

seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon and agreed, as follows :

***I will move that in light of traffic movement at the back of Scoil Ide on the Mill Road side of***

***Corbally (adjacent to recycle bins) that we assign an additional school traffic warden as soon as***

***possible.***

It was agreed to refer this motion to the relevant Director for consideration.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council calls on***

***the Government to bring forward legislation requiring all employers by law to make provision for***

***paid sick leave and to amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 with a new provision to allow*** ***an***

***employee who is the parent or adoptive parent of a child to avail of*** ***force majeure leave**.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan, seconded by Councillor Secas and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehan stated that Ireland is only one of five countries in

Europe that does not have paid sick leave which is unacceptable especially during the Covid 19

pandemic as it is a disincentive to follow health guidelines.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will call upon Limerick City and County Council to join the University of Limerick Student Life’s***

***calls on the Interim President of UL, Prof. Kerstin Mey, Chancellor Mary Harney and the***

***University’s Governing Authority to implement a rent freeze across all University owned***

***accommodation and cancel the plans to turn single occupancy rooms into twin (shared) rooms***
---

***which are clearly inadequate in terms of space and privacy, a proposal which because of the***

***COVID-19 pandemic is now due to come into effect in the 2021/2022 academic year.***

This Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Sheehan and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas stated that the changes to the management, terms and

cost of on campus accommodation outlined in her motion were due to come into force at the start

of the academic year 2020/2021 which the UL Student Life (ULSL) would have been very active in

resisting. No campus accommodation rent has increased by more than 4% this academic year,

however, the ULSL will continue to advocate for a rent freeze. Also the proposed new twin rooms

for 2nd and 3rd year students are extremely small and are not designed to hold two students and

the University must seek a more suitable and cost effective solution. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic

this proposal is now due to come into force in the 2021/2022 academic year and Members are

asked to support ULSL on this matter.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir (to be referred to the**

**Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council prepares and adopts a

footpath standard to guide all public realm interventions, with a purpose to have a consistent and

uniform approach in terms of finish and safety, and to only install infrastructure that is safe and

accessible for people of all ages and all abilities.

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

I will move at the next meeting that this Council, facilitate the lighting up of King John’s Castle and

City Hall in purple for International Recovery Day on 30th of September, in support and recognition

of all those who have lost their lives to addiction and those who are in active recovery.

Councillor Benson stated that she wished to amend her Notice of Motion to read as follows :

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council, facilitate the lighting up of City Hall in purple***

***for International Recovery Day on 30th of September, in support and recognition of all those who***

***have lost their lives to addiction and those who are in active recovery.***

This amended Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor Costelloe and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Benson stated that cities all over the world will light up their

landmarks in purple on 30th September – International Recovery Day - to stand in solidarity with all

those on their journey of recovery and to offer hope to those still suffering from addiction. The

Covid 19 pandemic has exposed the extent of drug use in Limerick and never before has it been

more important to highlight that recovery is possible.

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was taken as read.

It was agreed to hold the Metropolitan GMA Meeting on Monday, 19th October, 2020.

The Director, Service Operations, informed Members that the biggest supporter of Limerick’s

Annual International Band Championship, Mr. John Cox, had passed away and he proposed that a

vote of sympathy be extended to his wife, Marion and family on their bereavement. John had

brought many bands from America to Limerick over the years as well as providing American judges

for the event. He also promoted Limerick in America for many years through his network of

contacts that he had developed through his business.

Members stood in silence as a mark of respect.

This concluded the Meeting.

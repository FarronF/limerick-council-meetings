9. s i illor T

| will ask at the next Meeting regarding a major safety issue which has arisen in relation to
cycling on footpaths, and the latest gadget motorised small motorised type scooters which
are highly dangerous for young and old pedestrians when used on footpaths in Newcastle
West. Can the Council put signs, message on footpaths to make people aware it is not
acceptable, | think the Council should also liaise with the Gardai on this.

REPLY:

The regulation of traffic is a matter for the Traffic Authority — An Garda Siochana. Since 2015
the laws governing cycling have been regulated into specific fixed charge offences. Gardai
have the power to stop and fine a cyclist if they commit a fixed charge offence. Cycling on a
footpath is not a fixed charge offence. However other laws do include it as an offence.

Article 11 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations

2012 prohibits you from cycling beyond a traffic sign that prohibits bicycles.

Article 13 of the 1997 Regulations makes it an offence to cycle on a footpath unless

you are entering or exiting a property.

Article 45 of the 1997 Regulations (as amended by the Road Traffic (Traffic and

Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 1998), you must not cycle in a pedestrianised street or
area during the period indicated by the sign.

Although it is not a fixed charge offence to cycle on a footpath a cyclist could be fined for
doing so if a Garda deemed their cycling to be without ‘reasonable consideration’.

Since 2015 Gardai have the power to stop cyclists and fine them for specific fixed charge
cycling offences. Included in these offences are:

Riding a bicycle without reasonable consideration
Cycling in a pedestrianised street or area

The law in relation to eBikes and eScooters is somewhat less clear.

Under the Road Traffic Act 1961 at Section 3(1) (a) and (b) an MPV is defined as ‘a vehicle
intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical means, including;

(a) 2 bicycle or tricycle with an attachment for propelling it by mechanical power,

Whether or not the attachment is being used,

(b) a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical or partly electrical and partly
mechanical, but not including a tramcar or other vehicle running on permanent rails.’

The RSA website provides the following advice:

“Regardless of the type of bike, its speed or whether it requires a push start, the rules are as
follows:

*lf it can be powered by mechanical or electrical power alone (i.e. it can continue without you
pedalling or scooting it) then it is considered to be a ‘mechanically propelled vehicle’(MPV).

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
Under road traffic law if an MPV is used in a public place it is subject to all of the regulatory
controls that apply to other vehicles i.e. it must be roadworthy, registered, taxed and insured.
¢The driver of the vehicle must hold the appropriate driving licence and is obliged to wear a
crash helmet.”

Penalties under road traffic laws for using such a vehicle include fixed charge notices, penalty
points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle.

Former Minister for Transport, Shane Ross TD, in 2019 requested the RSA to carry out
research into how other EU member States regulate their use. Its key recommendations can

be found at the — link - hines.Lwwews sae fen /Atiity/News (2019/recommendations-

devices/,

Recommendations include, but are not limited to (i) that eBikes/eScooters should not be used
on footpaths and (ii) that /egis/ation will also need to be considered to give An Garda Siochana
the necessary powers to enforce the safe and legal use of electric personal mobility devices.

The Council will discuss this matter with An Garda Sfochdna and will continue to engage with
them on traffic issues through the various channels available to us.

Councillor Ruddle stated that a major safety issue had arisen in relation to cycling and
motorised scooters on footpaths which are highly dangerous for young and old pedestrians.
He asked that signage be put in place on footpaths to make people aware that this is not
acceptable.

10. Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddie

| will ask at the next Meeting if the Council could consider having an assigned person to look
after the general cleaning and maintenance of Newcastle West Playground, multi use play
area, the skate park and the tennis courts together. These are in great use and would need
regular cleaning and maintenance.

REPLY: The Council have recently assigned a dedicated person to the maintenance of
the play facilities in Newcastle West. This is currently underway and will
continue with daily maintenance at these play facilities.

11. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

be addressed as a matter of urgency

the Office of Public Works where these rivers flow through Abbeyfeale. It was noted that a

O'Donovan be written to with regard to the taking in charge of the Rivers Feale and
Allaughaun as he now has responsibility for the OPW.

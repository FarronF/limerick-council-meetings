**City Centre Revitalisation Project**

Ms Cecilia Larkin has been appointed as City Centre Revitalisation Manager to spearhead a

programme to help redress challenges in the retail sector and to increase footfall in the city

centre. She informed members that a Steering Group comprising of representatives from

Traders, Gardai, Council officials and Chamber of Commerce had been set up to address a

number of issues. Two meetings have been held to date and the following actions have

been taken:

 Increased Garda presence in City

 Cleaning Scheme activated

 Laneways cleaned and upgrading being considered

 Suite of activities proposed to increase footfall

 Ongoing networking with business owners to provide assistance/guidance

 Set up Shop Limerick to assist business during Covid 19 and into the future –

216 businesses showcased on Limerick.ie and 28,000 visitors to the site.

It is proposed to consult with estate agents and landlords to discuss options on vacant

properties; to liaise with retailers with a view to upskilling staff for ‘new way of shopping’

and pursue the possibility of setting up a discussion/co-operation group with counterparts

in other cities.

V. Murray stated that this initiative was part of a short term strategy for the redevelopment

of Limerick City, he also outlined medium / long term goals such as the delivery of Kirkland---
office development, Project Opera, UL City Centre Campus, Cleeves Campus, World Class

Waterfront, Docklands, Colbert Quarter, New Arthur’s Quay and other private sector

developments.

Members thanked Cecilia for the presentation and were delighted to see the progress and

innovation shown in getting businesses online, particularly during Covid19. They expressed

concern over the donut effect created by suburban shopping centres and suggested a city

centre light rail / free city centre bus / incentivised parking be introduced to encourage

people back into city centre. All such proposals are being considered under the

Metropolitan Area Transport System, which is going out for public consultation shortly.

While some members felt that the initiative was mainly city focussed, they stated that

County Limerick had also plenty of alternative shopping / tourism experiences to offer.

They suggested that a bigger focus should be placed on the domestic tourism market, which

will give a platform to support other businesses and give people a reason to visit Limerick. It

was confirmed that a promotional campaign for domestic tourism in Limerick city and

county would go live at end of June.

C. Larkin assured elected members that they will be invited to join the Steering Group and

she agreed to circulate a list of members of the Steering Group and a copy of the

presentation to the committee.

**Item 3**

**Guiding Limerick through Covid-19**

V. Murray gave a presentation to members on the draft proposals of Guiding Limerick through

Covid-19. He stated that Limerick City and County Council had commenced consultations in

relation to trialing a range of innovative measures aimed at getting the city centre moving in

the short-term and with an eye on its long-term transformation into a top urban

destination. The proposed measures which aim to make Limerick more family friendly

throughout the summer months will include pedestrianisation of a number of streets,

widening of footpaths allowing retailers bring their business out on the streets and the

provision of pop-up urban playgrounds for citizens allowing performance spaces and bespoke

activities unique to Limerick. The measures will be introduced in Catherine Street, Denmark

Street, Upper Denmark Street, Robert Street, Howley’s Quay and Nicholas Street. A speed

limit of 25kph will be introduced in the core city centre to make the city safer for pedestrians

and additional cycle routes from the suburbs to the city to encourage families / cyclists to use

this mode of transport.

On foot of receipt of public submissions of the proposals, the Council may revisit some of the

specific of the plan.

He also pointed out that while small business and retailers were particularly affected by

Covid-19, he outlined a number of measures that the Council and Limerick Enterprise Office

were providing to assist businesses through this difficult time e.g Business Restart Grant,

Rates Deferral, Covid-19 Business Loans, Trading Online Vouchers, Shop Limerick, Training

and Webinars and Tourism Sector Support Scheme.

While Members welcomed the presentation, they suggested that Byelaws for street trading

should be reviewed before the plan is enacted, that local authority staff be on-hand to identify---
pressure points and monitor queues once businesses reopened and that a reduction in

interest rates applied to business loans should also be examined.

Members expressed concern regarding the future of services from Shannon Airport and urged

the Council to support Shannon in any way it can.

**Item 4**

**Mid-West Business Response to Covid-19**

R. Corbett informed members that the Mid West Response Group (MWRG) was launched in

early March to assist in the Covid-19 economic recovery programme. Its main purpose was

to provide a pilot programme focussing on upskilling and reskilling people, displaced within

the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors. To date, 800 expressions of interest have been

received and 270 people have commenced training. He also pointed out that if the pilot

scheme was successful, it was hoped to have it rolled out to the entire region. The MWRG

are developing a longer term strategy to identify and maximise regional development

opportunities and it is hoped that EU funding will be available to progress the project.

Members thanked Rory for such a comprehensive presentation and stated that they were

delighted to see such a robust piece of work carried out in such a short period of time.

**Item 5**

**Presentation of Forward Planning Work Programme**

M. Woods, A/Senior Planner updated members on the workflow for the new Development

Plan.

 Official commencement of Development Plan – note at Council Mtg-July 2020

 Public consultation on issues paper will take place between 15 Aug-12 Oct 2020

(currently looking at new ways of engaging with the public)

 Draft Development Plan will be presented for adoption - Council Mtg May 2021

 Public consultation on Draft Plan - 5th June–16th Aug 2021

 Proposed amendments to Draft Plan – Council Meeting - Jan 2022

 Public consultation on amendments to Draft Plan – Feb-Mar 2022

 Adopt Development Plan at Council meeting - May 2022.

Development Plan workshops will be commencing shortly for elected members.

Many members raised serious concerns with regard to the National Planning Framework Rural

Housing policy and the interpretation by An Bord Pleanála of social and economic need. The

restriction on rural housing is threatening the viability of rural communities by taking away

the right of building a house in County Limerick unless you have a ‘social and economic need’.

Some members stated that they will have reservations on adopting a development plan that

contains this type of policy.

M. Woods clarified that a number of planning decisions made by the Council for one off houses

in rural Limerick were being overturned by An Bord Pleanála and that this matter will be

discussed further at a proposed workshop with elected members.

Replying to members, M. Woods clarified that the existing Development Plan cannot be rolled

over, as it has expired since 2016 and we have a legal obligation to implement national policy.

She also pointed out that should the new Development Plan not be adopted by the Council

then the responsibility for its adoption would fall to the Chief Executive.---
On the proposal of Cllr. Scanlan, seconded by Cllr. Egan, it was unanimously agreed to

recommend that the full Council request an urgent meeting with the Minister with

responsibility for Planning to outline the Council’s opposition to the National Planning

Framework on Rural Housing Policy.

It was also recommended that the request be circulated to all local authorities.

Members also asked that following such high incidences of Covid19 in densely populated

areas, that housing designs for older people would incorporate smaller units in reviewing the

Development Plan.

On the proposal of Cllr. Scanlan, seconded by Cllr. Galvin, it was unanimously agreed to

suspend Standing Orders in order to allow the completion of the meeting.

Ms. Woods also updated members on the following:

**Southern Env. Area Plan** **–**expiry May 21 – new plan will commence on 25th July, 2020

**Supp Contribution Scheme** (for the 3rd phase of Mungret Rd) – to commence end of Aug 2021

**URDF** – 2 local authority applications made:



World Class Waterfront (cost €500m / funding sought €158.63m)



Living Limerick City Centre ( €93m / funding sought €56.8m)

Members thanked Maria for the presentation and welcomed the plans for both projects

under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) Scheme.

She confirmed that the plans showing the footbridge in the World Class Waterfront

application were only indicative and further discussions will be held regarding the exact

location of same.

**Item 6**

**Any Other Business**

While members thanked the executive for organising the meeting virtually, they were

informed by V. Murray that the Council Chamber in Dooradoyle had been fitted out to allow

for social distancing for any further meetings.

That concluded the business of the meeting.

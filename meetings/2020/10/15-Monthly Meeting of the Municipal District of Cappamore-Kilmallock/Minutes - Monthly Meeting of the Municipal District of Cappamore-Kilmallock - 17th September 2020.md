these concerns under Section 70 of the 1993 Roads Act requesting that:

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
‘The owner or occupier of any structure and the owner or occupier of any land on which a
structure is situated shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the structure or the use of
the structure is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it
does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of a
public road.”

The respective landowner is then given a number of weeks to undertake follow up remedial
action or make contact with the Municipal District Office in relation to it. However if this
does not happen, then the road authority may serve a notice in writing on the owner or
occupier of the structure or on the owner or occupier of any land on which the structure is
situated to remove, modify or carry out specified works in relation to the structure within
the period stated in the notice.

To this end, in cases where Elected Members or the general public are aware of such issues
regarding trees and vegetation, the contact details and addresses of such landowners
should be provided to the Municipal District Office so that follow up action can take place to

resolve such an issue.

the pedestrian crossings on the N24 at Pallasgreen and Oola, do they need to be upgraded

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Brigid Teefy

I will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock that
adequate funding be sought as a matter of urgency to carry out the necessary Remedial and
Safety works at Holy Cross on the R512.

Proposed by Clir. Teefy, seconded by Cllr. Mitchell and agreed.

Reply:

Some funding has been allocated towards this scheme from the Development Fund in line
with a previous design done for the junction between the R512 and L1502. This, however,
would only be a percentage of the original estimated project completion cost at the time so
additional funding will therefore be required to undertake the project.

It is also now intended to lengthen the original design to include the junction between the
R512 and the L1500 and L1412 at Holycross. At present, the Municipal District Office is

arranging for the procurement of Consultants to amend the original design to incorporate
this. Upon completion of same, the revised scheme will be procured to determine budget

allocation required for it

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Gerald Mitchell

survey and inspection of all Limerick City and County Council road signs in the District be
carried out immediately in the interests of safety for all road users.

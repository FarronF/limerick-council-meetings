1. National & Regional Services Directorate

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Elected Members and Council staff to the Special Meeting.
He thanked the Director, National & Regional Shared Services and the Fire Services staff for
facilitating a preview of the proposed development site location for the Elected Members in
Kilmallock Business Park, which took place prior to the Special Meeting.

The Director, Support Services-Finance, Corporate, HR & ICT outlined the background to the
acquisition of Kilmallock Business Park by Limerick City and County Council earlier in 2020
and the engagement that Limerick City and County Council had with the businesses located
in the Business Park since its acquisition.

The Director, National & Regional Shared Services then outlined the background to the Fire
Services search for a suitable site for the proposed Fire Service Training Centre and the
rationale for choosing Kilmallock Business Park. She outlined the consultation and

included meeting with the Elected Members, meeting with local businesses in the Business
Park and meeting with Kilmallock Partnership group prior to the completion of the Part 8
application. She confirmed that the location of a Fire Service Training Centre would be very
beneficial to the local community and hospitality sector as it was envisaged that other local
authorities would use the Fire Service Training Centre for training purposes as well.

She then outlined the details of the actual Part 8 application and confirmed that this
proposal was Phase 1 of the proposed development, with the intention of later preparing a
Phase 2 application to complete the Fire Services Training Centre at this location. She went
through the planning report that was recommending approval of the Part 8 application and
which had been signed by the Chief Executive, and this was now being brought to the
Elected Members for their approval.

Some of the Elected Members welcomed the proposed development and noted the
engagement and consultation that had taken place in previous months in relation to the Fire
Services Training Centre. They noted that the Business Park had thrived since its acquisition
by Limerick City and County Council and believed that the Fire Services Training Centre
would be a welcome addition to the Business Park and the town of Kilmallock in general.
They noted the prior engagement and consultation that had taken place with the Elected
Members, along with business owners in the Business Park, as well as the Business
Partnership and expressed concerns that issues were now being raised at this late stage.
Concern was also expressed that if this Part 8 approval was not approved by the Elected
Members, that the project would be unduly delayed, or perhaps even lost to the town of
Kilmallock.

Some of the Elected Members expressed concern at the proposed development and the
affect it may have on the future expansion plans of existing businesses in the Business Park.
They noted that this proposed development could possibly deter new businesses in locating
in the Business Park. Reference was also made to the possible acquisition of additional land
in the Business Park by companies located in Kilmallock and the affect that a Fire Services
Training Centre would have on land availability in the Business Park.

Concern was also expressed at the level and frequency of burning that would be required as
part of the training in the Fire Services Training Centre, and the possible impact this would
have on existing businesses in the Business Park, as well as the wider community in
Kilmallock. They noted that the Director, National & Regional Shared Services had stated
that clean, dry timber products like timber pallets would be used for burning, but the
Elected Members noted that no condition had been put in the Part 8 report into the type of
material to be burned, or indeed the frequency of burnings allowed at the location.

They noted also the details of the one submission that was made as part of the Part 8 public
consultation process in relation to the issue of smoke generated as part of the burning, and
whether the Environmental Protection Agency should be consulted on the issue.

Overall, the Elected Members agreed that there were some concerns raised in their
deliberations that would have to be addressed. They also agreed that a comprehensive
design should be prepared, incorporating Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the proposed Fire Services
Training Centre, that would make up a future Part 8 proposal, that would allow the Elected
Members have full consideration of the overall proposal for the Fire Services Training
Centre.

Proposed by Councillor M. Ryan,
Seconded by Councillor Donegan.
And Resolved:

â€œThat, the Part 8 Planning Application for a Fire Service Training Centre at Kilmallock Business

Park, Ardyoul, Bruree Road, Kilmallock, Co. Limerick not be proceeded with in accordance
with Section 179 (4) (b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

This concluded the Meeting.

While the ability of the Authority to limit damage or injury from any future

storms is restricted there are a number of significant measures that we

can promote, support and administer particularly if such measure relate

to private lands and boundaries.

Specifically there are legal obligations on Land owners or occupiers to take

certain measures under Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 (in respect of

roadside trees\hedges etc.)

**Roads Act 1993 Sect 70.**—(1) (*a)* *The owner or occupier of any structure*

*(e.g. Tree) and the owner or occupier of any land on which a structure is*

*situated shall reasonable steps to ensure that the structure or the use of*

*the structure is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public*

*road and that it does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public*

*road or the maintenance of a public road.*

While the Wildlife Act 1976 (updated in 2019) applies some seasonal

restrictions (March to August) on verge\hedge & tree maintenance ended

on 31st August we would ask that all Land owners and occupiers take the

measures necessary to mitigate against such dangers from overhanging

trees or overgrown hedges.

It should be noted that there is no such seasonal limitations apply where

such measures are deemed necessary by the Roads Authority to prevent a

hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road.

Furthermore, where the Roads Authority (District Engineer) has safety

concerns there are provisions to address inaction under Section 70 of the

Road Act 1993.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**8.**

**Notice** **of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting in light of the recent storm damage that hedge-cutting**

**and tree trimming on all main roads and secondary roads in the Adare-Rathkeale**

**District is carried out without delay in the critical interest of public safety.**

**Reply:**

The trees on the N21 were all cut back last year and consequently there

were minimal issues on this route (note these trees were on lands under

the control of the Local Authority).

While the ability of the Authority to limit damage or injury from any future

storms is restricted there are a number of significant measures that we

can promote, support and administer particularly if such measures relate

to private lands and boundaries.

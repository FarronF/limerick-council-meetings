**Item 3**

**Update on Limerick Food Strategy**

James Burke, Facilitator of Limerick Food Strategy, informed members of a new website

LimerickFood.ie, which was recently launched to promote and develop Limerick’s food and

drink industry, by showcasing the wealth of high quality food and drink on offer across

Limerick city and county. The website has currently 29 producer’s profiles.

He outlined the following plans for 2020:

 Food Seminar in April – regional focus

 Irish Quality Food Awards – based in Limerick

 Limerick Show 2020 – Food Village with up to 30 exhibitors

 Food Related Training – supported by LEO

 Designation of Limerick Ham as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) Status

 Launch of a new map – to develop West Limerick as food destination.

It was suggested by the elected members to create a Limerick Food Trail, which would seek

to link all food producers, hotels and restaurants in the area, which would increase business

and address a major gap in the tourism market in Limerick. Mr. Burke agreed to explore this

suggestion.

While members welcomed the presentation, they also expressed concern over the cost of

producing a specialised product, getting local produce into restaurants, stringent legislation

applying to food producers and low prices being paid for high quality beef, which was

unsustainable for local farmers.

They also expressed concern over the lack of funding and support available to the Milk Market

in Limerick City, which is a huge tourism drawn in the region.

Replying to members on how to get people to purchase local produce, James Burke suggested

that schools be invited to include the food programme into the transition year curriculum and

educate students on making food accessible to all. He also suggested an interesting dynamic

would be to include a condition of ‘local produce only’ in any tenders for large catering

facilities in the future.

B. Moloney advised members that LEO provide a large range of mentoring programmes, free

expert advice and a Green Start programme, which is available to larger companies through

Enterprise Ireland, to encourage companies to use environmental best practice to improve

their competitiveness.

**Item 4**

**Presentation of Forward Planning Work Programme**

M. Woods, A/Senior Planner stated that work will commence on the first Joint City and County

Development Plan on 31st May, 2020 and it is hoped to be adopted by Q1, 2022. She outlined

the scope and the timeline of the proposed Development Plan. She stated that it was a

reserved function of elected members to make the Development Plan and it was important

that they work closely with the executive during this process. The inaugural meeting of the

steering group had taken place and it was agreed that seven different sub-groups would be

formed to consider the following topics: City & Environs, County Towns, Local Area Plans,

Infrastructure, Recreation & Social, Economic Development and Climate Change. Workshops

and training will be provided for elected members.

She also updated members on the following:

**RSES** – adopted on 31/1/20 and working with Regional Assembly on implementation of the

objectives.

**Development Contribution Scheme** – to be reviewed and new draft scheme to be prepared.

**Supp Contribution Scheme** – for the provision of future phases of Mungret Link Rd to be prepared.

**URDF** – Call for proposals to close on 31/3/20. All applications to be made by local authorities;

however collaboration with other public bodies and with the private sector is encouraged. All

projects must be capable of completion by end of 2027 and match-funding requirement is a

minimum of 25%. She stated that they are currently preparing a number of applications, with the

view of bundling various projects together.

**Local Area Plan(LAP) Progamme** – Updated members on LAPs - she pointed out that both the Adare

and Askeaton LAPs had been extended and that the Southern Environ LAP is to be reviewed and

incorporated into the proposed Development Plan.

**Retail Strategy** – Joint Plan to be prepared with Clare County Council.

**Height Strategy** – will be included as part of proposed Development Plan

**Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy** – working with National Transport

Authority - will be incorporated into proposed Development Plan.

On the proposal of Cllr. Galvin, seconded by Cllr. Keary, it was unanimously agreed to suspend

Standing Orders in order to allow the completion of the meeting.

Many members raised serious concerns with regard to the National Planning Framework rural

housing policy and the interpretation by An Bord Pleanála of social and economic need. The

restriction on rural housing is threatening the viability of rural communities – schools, clubs,

community life etc. Some members stated that they will have reservations on adopting a

development plan that contains this type of policy.

Members welcomed the opportunity to review the Council policies on protected structures.

Reference was also made to Living City Initiative Scheme, which offers tax incentives to develop

Georgian buildings in the city and the low level of take up in Limerick City and asked that the scheme

be reviewed. V. Murray stated that he would arrange an update on the Living City Initiative at the

next meeting.

Members also raised the issue of a possible de-zoning of residential land in the new plan.

It was clarified that should the new Development Plan not be adopted by the Council then the

responsibility for its adoption would fall to the Executive.

**Next Meeting: Monday, 14th** **April, 2020.**

That concluded the business of the meeting.

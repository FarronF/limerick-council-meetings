***to Councillors, TD’s and Senators and if this practice is fully compliant with data protection.***

**REPLY:**

The Policy and Process agreed in relation to the allocation of Council Housing Stock

was agreed in 2014 with the merging of both Councils. The Allocation Scheme was

adopted in 2017 in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous

Provisions) Act 2009, the Social Housing Allocation Regulations 2011 and the Social

Housing Allocation Amendment Regulations 2016.

**The Process**

Council Officials review available Council properties with all approved applicants for

the area. Houses are allocated to approved applicants in accordance with the

Scheme of Letting Priorities. If an Elected Member or TD makes representations for

a housing applicant, this representation is noted on CRM.

Following the allocation of a Council property to an applicant, a notification is issued

to the Elected Member or TD who made representations on the applicants behalf.

A notification is then sent to Elected Members and TD’s to inform them of the

address (not personal details) that has been allocated. Individual house numbers

are not issued in this notification. This process was developed in the interest of

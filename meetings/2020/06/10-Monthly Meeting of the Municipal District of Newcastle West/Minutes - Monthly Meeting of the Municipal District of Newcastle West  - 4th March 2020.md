QUESTIONS

8.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at*** ***the Meeting for the following (i) a detailed update on works for Ward’s Cross,***

***Abbeyfeale (ii) a detailed update on works for Devon Cross, Abbeyfeale (iii) a detailed***

***update on the plan for the Cryleview estate junction, Abbeyfeale (iv) a detailed update on***

***the plan for St. Ita’s Road, Abbeyfeale with regard to road widening and traffic calming***

***measures.***

REPLY:

**(i)**

The technical consultants appointed for the scheme, Barry Transportation, have

progressed the detailed design for the right turn lane and a number of design issues

arose as part of this process. These issues arose from retrofitting a right turn lane into

a road constrained by the carriageway alignment, the location of properties in the

vicinity of the junction and the topography of the surrounding land. Many of these

issues do not conform to current road design parameters and will require a departure

from standards from TII.

The technical consultants have worked to refine the design and remove as many

departures from standards as possible by means of a workshop and consultations with

the Road Design Office and TII Safety and Pavement sections. This process has been

largely successful but a number of issues still require a departure from standards.

We are endeavouring to finalise the design, prepare the Preliminary Design Report

and submit the departure application as soon as possible.

**(ii)**

Barry Transportation have recently submitted a draft feasibility report for the N21

Devon Cross junction and the report outlines three options that have been developed

for the junction. The three options are as follows:

**1.**

To construct traffic calming measures on approaches to and through Devon

Cross.

**2.**

To create a staggered junction by realigning the local road north of the N21,

the L7059 that commences at Buckley’s Shop, to the east of Devon Cross.

**3.**

To create a roundabout junction to the west of Devon Cross and realigning the

regional road, the R515 that commences at Hartnett’s Service station, to the

west.

Staff of the Road Design Office have reviewed the options developed and the draft---
6

report was also submitted to TII for their consideration.

Subject to TII approval of the recommendations in the finalised feasibility report and

allocation of the necessary funding, Barry Transportation could then proceed with the

detail design process for the preferred option and preparation of tender documents.

**(iii)**

The revised feasibility report has been submitted to TII safety section for approval. A

response is expected in the coming weeks.

**(iv)**

St. Ita’s Road is not included in the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Planand therefore

there are currently no plans to carry out road widening and traffic calming measures

on this roadway.

Councillor Galvin noted the above and requested that a representative from the Mid West

National Road Design office be invited to attend the next Municipal District Meeting to discuss

this matter further.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***that a reflector be placed on the ESB pole at Healy’s bend on***

10.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting that an emergency mobile number be given out to the***

***Councillors on weekends.***

REPLY:

The Council has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with Voxpro for out of hours

calls. This SLA is for 80% of calls to be answered in 20 seconds during normal

service demands. Any service issues will be followed up with Voxpro regarding

their service levels.

Also officials of the Council prioritise responding to the Elected Members and

are committed to ensuring they are supported in their public role. The senior

staff have been and continue to be available to the Members in cases of

emergency during out of hours periods. In this regard the Newcastle West

Municipal members have the numbers of key staff in the area.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the progress being made with the TII on the***

***re-surfacing of the N21 at South Quay, Newcastle West as the roadway is in very bad***

***condition with sinking in parts and is a danger at present.***---
7

REPLY:

Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have identified the entire N21 in

Newcastle West town within the speed limits for a Pavement Strengthening

Scheme.

Funding of €240,000 has been included in 2020 National Roads Allocations for

the N21 Newcastle West Pavement Scheme. This scheme is to be developed

by the Mid West Road Design Office.

In the meantime, Limerick City and County Council have applied for special

funding to TII to address the current serious condition of the carriageway along

South Quay.

A decision is still awaited on this funding application.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on when re-surfacing works will be carried out***

***at Upper Maiden Street, Newcastle West as the road surface is poor and the speed ramps***

***are disintegrating.***

REPLY:

Road resurfacing works will be carried out at Upper Maiden Street on the first

week of April 2020 as a temporary road closure is required to facilitate these

works.

***Road, Newcastle West along the R522 towards the speed limit.***

NOTICES OF MOTION

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that a footpath be placed on the right hand side of the road***

***from Dalton’s Cross towards Abbeyfeale town in the interest of safety.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that a footpath be placed at the above

location in the interest of safety.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

It is the policy of the Council to maintain existing footpaths within the towns

and villages of Limerick.

The requested works noted above, would include drainage, public lighting and

extending the footpath beyond the speed limit on the N21, would involve

significant expenditure.

There is a very extensive network of roads and footpaths in the Newcastle

West Municipal District and these are subject to significant wear and tear.

Regrettably, there is also a high rate of claims against the Council for slips, trips

and falls on the network and this is reflected in the high cost of public liability

insurance. The Council has invested resources in the repair and maintenance

of existing footpaths to mitigate the risk to users in recent years. However, it

is also the case that there has been serious underinvestment in this service for

many years.---
9

Having regard to the details set out above, it is not possible, regrettably to

accede to requests to extend footpaths in this area, as the focus of the Council

is on maintaining the existing public realm within the resources available to it.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the dykes be closed at both sides of the road at the***

***Tubarine Bridge (bridge between Abbeyfeale and Templeglantine).***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that the dykes be closed at both sides

of the road at the Tubarine Bridge.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY**:**

Works will be carried out in this area within the next two weeks.

The following items were also raised.

An update on the proposed Meeting with representatives of Abbeyfeale Town Park to discuss

various funding streams which may be available to the group. The Meetings Administrator

stated that a Meeting is to take place next week with the Committee.

The clearing of two of the three eyes in the bridge in Athea by the Office of Public Works was

requested to prevent flooding to the village of Athea.

Responsibility for river erosion and flooding along the bank of the River Feale and River

Allaughaun in Abbeyfeale was raised. Subsidence of riverbank at town park was also raised.

It was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would again write to the OPW on these

matters.

The Members also referred to Irish Water and a discussion followed on a number of items

including how representations are dealt with and the Service Level Agreement between the

Council and Irish Water. The work on the River Feale by Irish Water and the impact it may

have had on the riverbank at the Town Park was also raised for discussion with Irish Water.

It was agreed that these items would be referred to Irish Water for a response.

An update regarding clarification on the remaining capacity in waste water treatment plants

was requested. The Meetings Administrator stated that a response had been received from

the Senior Engineer, Water Services, and she outlined that Irish Water had advised that the

information recently given on the capacity at various plants was correct and that

equipment has been replaced at some of the plants which has resulted in this increased

capacity.

The current status of the remaining twelve houses at the Cois Na Feile estate, Abbeyfeale

was referred to and the request to have these twelve houses purchased. The extension of---
10

the footpath leading to the estate was also requested.

The pedestrian crossing in Templeglantine was also raised. The Senior Executive Engineer

confirmed there is no funding to change the location of the crossing.

Prior to the conclusion of the Meeting, the Senior Executive Engineer referred to the

Newcastle West Traffic Movement and Public Realm Plan and the proposal to install traffic

lights. He stated that a visit could be arranged to view traffic lights in the centre of Fermoy

which would be similar to the system proposed for Newcastle West.

It was agreed that a Workshop on the Burial Ground Strategy would take place after the April

Municipal District Meeting.

It was agreed to hold the April Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 1st April, 2020, at 10.00

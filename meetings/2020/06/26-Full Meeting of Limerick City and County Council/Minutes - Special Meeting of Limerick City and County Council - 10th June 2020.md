It was noted at the outset that, owing to COVID-19 restrictions, the Meeting was a Quorum

Only Special Meeting of the Council, comprising the Corporate Policy Group and Party

Leaders.

The Mayor opened the Meeting and welcomed the Members present back to the Council

Chamber after the break in routine due to COVID-19. The Chief Executive also welcomed the

Members present and thanked them for their support over the previous three months.

1.Fixing of Venue for Annual Meeting of the Council

The Mayor asked the Meetings Administrator to brief the Members on the venue options

available for the hosting of the Annual Meeting.

The Meetings Administrator explained that, in accordance with Standing Orders, the Annual

meeting was fixed for Tuesday, 30th June, 2020 - the last working day in the month of June.

He proposed Limerick Racecourse, Patrickswell, as the venue as it could accommodate the

Meeting and the associated physical distancing requirements.

A query was raised as to whether alternative options in Limerick City had been considered for

the hosting of the Meeting and the Meetings Administrator explained that, due to COVID-19,

hotels were still closed and other venues considered, such as the University of Limerick, were

also not available to host the Meeting.

On the proposal of Councillor Ryan (E), seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), it was agreed to

select Limerick Racecourse, Patrickswell, as the venue for the Annual Meeting.

2.Fixing of Date and Venue for next Ordinary Meeting of the Council

The Mayor asked the Meetings Administrator to brief the Members on the date and venue

options available for the hosting of the next Ordinary Meeting of the Council.

The Meetings Administrator proposed that Limerick Racecourse, Patrickswell, be utilised as it

could accommodate the Meeting and the associated physical distancing requirements.

In the discussion that followed it was considered that, owing to the length of the Agenda for

the Ordinary Meeting, it might not be appropriate to hold the Meeting on the same day as

the Annual Meeting (30th June). It was also stated that a separate day was always appointed

for the Annual Meeting of the Council. Options for a date for the Meeting were then discussed

and, on the proposal of the Mayor, seconded by Councillor Collins (M), it was agreed to hold

the next Ordinary Meeting of the Council at Limerick Racecourse, Patrickswell, on Friday 26th

June, 2020, at 3pm.

A query was raised as to whether the Meeting should be limited to two hours owing to

Government Guidelines on Meetings during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Mayor

assured Members that the Meeting should be concluded within the two-hour timeframe.

A further query was raised as to whether the Meeting would be open to the public. The

Meetings Administrator confirmed that it would be a Public Meeting.

The cost of the pandemic to Limerick City was queried and it was agreed that an update would

be provided at the Ordinary Meeting on 26th June.

This concluded the Meeting.

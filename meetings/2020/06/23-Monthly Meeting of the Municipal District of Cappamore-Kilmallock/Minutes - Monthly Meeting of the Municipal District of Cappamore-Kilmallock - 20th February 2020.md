NOTICE OF MOTION

6. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

| will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock that the
Municipal District call on the HSE to ensure the Hospital town ShannonDoc out-of-hours GP
service continue to operate as normal, despite growing fears in recent weeks that it is
reducing its support hours.

Proposed by Clir. M. Donegan, seconded by Clir. M. Ryan and agreed.

Reply:

ShannonDoc has reiterated that it is ‘service as usual’ at all of its treatment centres
throughout the Mid-West. More than 10,000 patients used our service over the Christmas
period (21° December to 5" January) in our treatment centres across Limerick, Clare and
North Tipperary. However, ShannonDoc is undertaking a major review of operations to
ensure its future sustainability.

ShannonDoc is facing considerable challenges year on year; in particular, due to the lack of
locums to cover the out-of-hours service and a failure to fill a number of GP lists in the
region due to retirement of members.

Furthermore, with the impending reality of a quarter of GPs due to retire over the next five
years in Ireland without sufficient younger doctors entering general practice to fill these
vacancies; action is now required.

Chairman Dr. Pat Morrissey said: “The GP shortage, in particular, is putting unsustainable
pressure on both the current daytime GP service across the region and additionally our out-
of-hours service. At a time when locum doctors are harder to source, this is creating a
difficulty for ShannonDoc, Due to these challenges ShannonDoc Board have commenced a
review of the operations to determine the most efficient way to continue to deliver a
sustainable service.”

“However, the policy of ShannonDoc Is to ensure the people of the Mid-West continue to
receive the level of service that they have become accustomed to over the last 18 years and
are confident that we can deliver a viable plan which will be sustainable in the future for
our patients, GPs and staff.”

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

| will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock that the
next phase of the roll out of CCTV to the towns and villages of the District, that were not
included in the first phase, include the following locations: Hospital, Bruff, Knockiong,
Knockainey, Kilteely, Herbertstown, Galbally, Ballylanders, Martinstown, Bulgaden, Meanus,
Grange, Bruff, Garrydoolis and Templebraden.

Proposed by Cllr. Mitchell, seconded by Cllr. E. Ryan and agreed.
Reply:

The Council position is that no new projects are proceeding at present. Wave 2 of the
Hinterlands project is already procured and financed. This cannot be extended to include
other areas. What the proposals below indicate is an entirely new project, which would
involve considerable preparation in terms of planning, scoping, legal requirements and
funding, and this is not possible in the short term.

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

| will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock that the
Municipal District request the Environment Section of Limerick City and County Council to
engage in a publicity campaign through local media, social media, etc. to focus attention and
awareness on the unacceptable anti-social behaviour of illegal dumping that has blighted
the roads and fields of County Limerick.

Proposed by Clir M. Ryan, seconded by Cllr Teefy and agreed.

Reply:

Limerick City and County Council commissioned a short social media video in December
2019, urging people to use licensed operators only to remove their rubbish. On the
Limerick Council Twitter account, it gained 1,659 impressions, 226 views, and 7
engagements. This was accompanied by a cinema campaign covering all screenings across
Limerick cinemas for a 6-week period from December 2019 to January 2020. In addition,
the Council has run similar short adverts on Live 95 during the year.

The initiative was funded under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and
Environments anti-Dumping Initiative 2019.

Members of the public who witness environmental pollution such as fly tipping, littering
or backyard burning may also report it to Limerick City and County Council Customer
Services at 061-556000 or the free phone litter line 1800 201 501 or the See /t? Say It! App.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this District requests a full break down and**

**analysis of how the calculated cost of €70,000 was spent on the recent so called**

**Limerick brand. How was this funded and where exactly did the monies come from to**

**support same.**

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey advised that while he was supportive of

Limerick as a brand he had an issue with the money spent on the branding being

allocated to a London based company instead of local enterprise and also the Limerick

College of Art & Design. The Director, National and Regional Shared Services informed

Members that the Limerick College of Art & Design had been consulted and involved in

the creation of the design. Councillor Sheahan agreed to second this Motion provided

the term “so called” was removed. Councillor Teskey was in agreement.

**REPLY:**

In May 2018, Limerick City and County Council sought to develop and

deliver a compelling and coherent brand identity for Limerick to enhance

the competitiveness and attractiveness of the region.

The purpose of developing a competitive brand identity is to support the

development of Limerick as a vibrant economic and visitor destination, as

well as a unifying stimulus for all City and County stakeholders. It will

communicate Limerick as a contemporary international location to live,

work, invest, study and visit.

The tender to design and create a new Brand identity for Limerick was

awarded to M&C Saatchi following a competitive process. A sum of

€70,000 was allocated to the project and noted in the tender.

The actual spend for the creation of the new Limerick Brand identity came

in at €73,968.68 when VAT is included.

The spend was budgeted for in the 2018 Marketing and Communications

revenue code and allocated accordingly.

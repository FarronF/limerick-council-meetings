**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor** **S. Benson**

***I will ask Limerick City and County Council to provide the cost of installing the 5,200 LED lights***

***that have already been installed under the remit of this Council.***

**REPLY:**SSE Airtricity-Utility Services provides a service to Limerick City and County Council, Cork

County Council, Clare County Council, Kerry County Council and Waterford City and County

Council for the installation of public street lights, where the existing light fittings have failed.

Public lighting is a specialised area, in particular working with ESB overhead networks, and

there are a limited number of contractors available to provide the service.

It has been the policy of the Council for the past number of years to replace failed lights

with LED lights. This is in part due to the fact that the existing SOX/SON lights are no longer

available on the market, LED lights are more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.

Approximately 5,200 out of 22,900 public lights have been upgraded to LED lights over the

past 5 years. These lights were replaced on an ad hoc basis, under the SSE Airtricity-Utility

Services contract, as the lights have failed.

There are a number of variables which have to be considered when putting a cost on the

replacement of failed lights including:

 the wattage of the light – different lights producing different lux levels are used in

different locations e.g. national roads, towns and villages, housing estates;

 the location of the light;

 the works requirements for replacing the light – cabling work associated with

unbundling, installation of micro pillars, bracket replacement, ESB attendance costs,

Traffic management costs, civil works, column replacement;

 health and safety considerations associated with traffic, overhead electric or fibre optic

cables, trees etc.

The table below sets outs the current average cost of replacement LED lights. Please note

that these costs do not include for cabling work associated with unbundling, installation of

micro pillars, bracket or column replacement, ESB attendance costs, Traffic management

costs, civil works where required, or for procurement, design, project management and

supervision costs.

**Wattage of LED light**

**Average Cost € ex VATReplacing**

100w LED lamp and photocell €730

(replaces 250W and 400W son)

80w LED lamp and photocell

(replaces 150W son, 135W sox

and 125W son)

€530

(replaces 70W son and 100W

son)

40w LED lamp and photocell

€300

(replaces 55W sox and LED

replacement bulbs)

Councillor Benson stated that the reply was not satisfactory and expressed concern at the overall

cost of replacing the public lighting system with LED lights. She stated that further clarification was

required on the cost of replacing the 5200 lights already completed.

The Director, Physical Development outlined that it is difficult to ascertain a definitive cost and the

cost of installing each light differs due to variables such as location, health and safety requirements,

traffic management and associated works. He confirmed that he would seek further clarification

from the Service Operations Directorate and revert to Councillor Benson.

The Meetings Administrator stated that, as the item ‘Raising of Loan Facility for the Local Authority

Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project – Southern Region’ was approved at the January Meeting

of the Full Council, this matter is outside the role of the Metropolitan District.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor** **E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a detailed report of the consultation done with businesses during***

***the Parnell, Davis and Wickham Street works**and the retail strategy for these streets.***

**REPLY**:

The formal public consultation on these projects took place during the Part 8

Planning process. Regular informal consultation with business owners / operators

took place during the course of the works on issues ranging from the proposed

development to day-to-day business operational issues.

The policy and strategy related to retail in Limerick City is set out in the Limerick City

Development Plan 2010-2016 (as extended). The policy on retail will be reviewed

as part of the preparation of the new Development Plan to be commenced in mid-

2020.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor** **E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the motion passed by Council in relation to a night***

***time strategy and appointing a night mayor.***

**REPLY**:

The development of a night time strategy is currently being discussed and is being

led by the Economic Development Department. Discussions are ongoing with the

Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Service in Economic

Development. A detailed report will be presented to the next Metropolitan District

meeting.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas** (referred from Meeting of Limerick City

and County Council held on 27th January 2020)

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council approve the submission made late last year to***

***the Development Fund Allocations for 2020 for the Mt. St. Oliver Graveyard Perimeter Works,***

***given that the previous submission made for 2018 was declined and given the ongoing serious***

***safety concerns around the graveyard.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas referred to the temporary measure and the need for a

permanent solution to address safety concerns. She thanked the staff for their co-operation and

assistance in this matter and is satisfied that this issue will be resolved in the near future.

The motion was seconded by Councillor Slattery and agreed.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Metropolitan meeting to require the contractor charged with grass cutting***

***to collect the grass as it is being cut in housing estates and built up areas of the city, where***

***feasible.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kiely stated that when grass is cut, litter and debris are also

shredded and footpaths and surrounding areas are unsightly, particularly in Kennedy and Glasgow

Parks and Galvone. She requested that the edges of the paths be maintained and that the Street

Cleaning Crews liaise with the contractor.

The motion was seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

**REPLY**:

The Contractor is contracted to collect the first grass cut and mulch subsequent

cuts. However, it has been decided that the Contractor will commence early this

year so that there will be no need for a collection as the grass will be shorter and

will be mulched which will result in the grass decomposing quickly.

The Director, Service Operations stated that additional resources had been allocated to grass

cutting this year. He noted the Members comments in relation to the importance of the

presentation of housing estates and grass cutting when there is litter in the green areas. Director,

Service Operations, agreed to liaise with relevant engineer and will keep the matter under review.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council send a letter to the incoming Government to***

***release funding for St. Gabriel’s Respite House for children with acute, life-limiting conditions***

***which remains closed one year after completion so as it can be opened without delay.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor Hartigan and agreed.

Members supported the motion stating that the facility is urgently required by children and families

with serious, life-limiting conditions.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council promote Patrickswell to be***

***recommended to the N.R.A. to become a server village because of its close proximity to the N20.***

***There are 35 to 40 businesses in Patrickswell and there is easy access in and out at both ends of***

***the village.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor McSweeney and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kilcoyne referred to the number of businesses that have closed

recently in Patrickswell and also emphasised the inadequate signage on the motorway when

***I will call at the next meeting that this Council writes to the HSE to put in place funding for the***

***school nurse at St. Vincent’s Lisnagry Special School and ensure that the school does not lose its***

***nurse in June 2020.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the urgent need to put funding in place for

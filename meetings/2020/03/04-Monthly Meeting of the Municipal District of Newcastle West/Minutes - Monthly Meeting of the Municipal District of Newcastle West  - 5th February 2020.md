REPLY:

An audit was conducted on the Abbeyfeale playground. The playground

consists of two play areas, one for juniors and one for seniors. The senior play

area is in relatively good condition given it is 11 years old. The junior play area

is in need of investment in terms of play value and refurbishment.

The report recommends a number of play items to be replaced. The report also

recommends the replacement of fencing for both the junior and senior

playgrounds.

The following is a summary of the findings with estimated costs:

 Replace boundary fencing in junior playground - €3,900

 Replace boundary fencing in senior playground - €5,700

 Replace both gates - €1,900

 Replace Spring Rocker in junior area - €750 (replaced on 4th December

2019)

 Replace set of chains on swing in senior area - €120

 Replace chains on inclusive seat - €60

The total estimated costs are €13,325

It is the Council’s intention to carry out all of the above works and have them

completed by the end of February 2020.

mechanism for other upgrade works required in the park including the MUGA.

NOTICES OF MOTION

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that a pedestrian crossing be provided at the church in***

***Templeglantine.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that a pedestrian crossing at the church was

requested in the interest of safety.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

The original design prepared by the Mid West National Road Design Office for

the Templeglantine traffic calming scheme proposed an uncontrolled

pedestrian crossing at the Church. During the public consultation phase of the

planning for this scheme, it was requested and agreed locally that a more

suitable location for the crossing was closer to the national school. The

scheme proceeded to construction and a crossing was constructed at the

agreed location.

It should be noted that Limerick City and County Council has consulted with TII

on the provision of a pedestrian crossing at the Church. TII have no objection

in principle with having a crossing at the church, but it would require that the

existing crossing be removed as having two crossings in close proximity on the

national road could create a traffic hazard. It should also be noted that TII

would not fund such an alteration.

The response was noted and agreed.

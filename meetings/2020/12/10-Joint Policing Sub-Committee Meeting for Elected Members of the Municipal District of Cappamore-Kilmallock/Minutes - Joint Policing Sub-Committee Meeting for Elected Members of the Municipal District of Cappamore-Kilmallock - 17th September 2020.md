**2.**Policing Issues in the District

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Ryan and Superintendent O’Connor to the

meeting. The Cathaoirleach noted that it was Superintendent O’Connor’s first appearance at

the JPC Sub Committee’s meetings and he thanked him for attending.

Superintendent Ryan gave an update on current policing issues within the Bruff Garda District.

He confirmed that while there had been a reduction in certain crime categories, including

burglaries, public order offences and minor assaults, that domestic incidents and drug---

possessions in particular had seen an increase from the previous figures. These increases were

being attributed to the Covid outbreak and subsequent lockdown from March, which entailed

increased patrols and Garda checkpoints across the Municipal District.

Superintendent O’Connor thanked the Members for inviting him to the JPC Sub-Committee

Meeting. He confirmed that the Roxboro District of an Garda Síochána covered the areas of

Ballyneety and Caherconlish in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District.

He proceeded to give an overview of the Garda operational set up for Ballyneety and

Caherconlish. He confirmed that there had been a reduction in most crime categories in

recent months, and that crime levels overall were generally low in Ballyneety and

Caherconlish. He also confirmed that Gardaí from the Roxboro Garda Station also provided

backup to the Gardaí covering Ballyneety and Caherconlish as required.

The Superintendents also confirmed that the rollout of the new Operating Model by An Garda

Síochána had been delayed due to the Covid outbreak but that the intention was that this

Operating Model would be rolled out in 2021.

The Elected Members thanked the Superintendents for their respective presentations and, in

particular, they praised the work done by An Garda Síochána during Covid 19 and subsequent

lockdown during the year so far. They referred to the high visibility of Gardaí at checkpoints

across the Municipal District and highlighted the importance of everyone adhering to

government guidelines in order to ensure that Covid levels were kept under control.

The Elected Members also welcomed the reduction in crime in certain categories and

expressed concern at the increase in domestic incidents in particular, which were likely a

symptom of increased lockdown measures with more people required to remain at home

during Covid.

The Elected Members also noted that horse control issues had improved in recent months in

the Municipal District and thanked the Gardaí for their efforts in this area. They also stressed

the importance of continued activity by An Garda Síochána in tackling drug dealing and supply

which are an ongoing problem across the Municipal District.

Finally, the Elected Members expressed their condolences to An Garda Síochána in relation

to Garda Colm Horgan who was tragically killed in the line of duty in Castlerea, Co.

Roscommon on the 17th June, 2020.

This concluded the business of the meeting.

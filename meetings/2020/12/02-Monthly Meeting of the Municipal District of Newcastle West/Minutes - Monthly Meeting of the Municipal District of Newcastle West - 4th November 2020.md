NOTICES OF MOTION

10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that a delivery bay be provided along Lower Bridge Street,***

***Newcastle West.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

There is a loading bay at Bridge Street, Newcastle West along with disc parking

spaces and a disabled parking space.

A loading bay can only be used by a commericially insured vehicle while in the

process of loading or unloading. There are also other loading bays in the

vicinity of Bridge Street at Upper and Lower Maiden Street, the Square and

South Quay.

The Council are satisfied that no further loading bays are required along Lower

Bridge Street, Newcastle West.

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that our Authority work with the appropriate Approved***

***Housing Bodies to secure delivery of renewable derelict sites in order to improve the level***

***of housing delivery within this Municipal District.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY:

The property and community facilities department who manage actions taken

in relation to derelict sites do not work directly with Approved Housing Bodies.

The Housing Development Directorate liaise directly with Approved Housing

Bodies regarding the acquisition of houses that are vacant and generally in

need of some level of refurbishment works.

Subject to the normal assessment criteria such as housing need, appropriate

balance of housing in the area, purchase price and cost of works etc., Limerick

City and County Council work with the Approved Housing Body to support a

funding application to the Department of Housing to allow the project to

proceed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan expressed his disappointment at the response

received and requested that the Local Authority work with the appropriate Approved Housing

Bodies to improve the delivery of housing in our villages.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council take in charge the Rays estate,***

***Mountcollins, Co. Limerick.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

The process for the taking in charge of this estate will be commenced. This will

involve obtaining reports from our Roads, Water Services and Parks Sections

including a schedule of works required in order to have this estate completed

to a taking in charge standard. The completion of these works will be

dependent on available funding.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that a discussion be held in relation to heating systems***

***recently installed in our housing stock.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

**(a)**

The heating system used in New Build units is an air to water heat pump. Combined

with full fill cavities and floor insulation, it is considered to be an effective economic

solution to heating costs.

In relation to refurbs, where possible a heat pump will be installed, however, this will

only occur where floors are being removed and a cavity exists. This is to allow the

installation of correct levels of insulation. In other refurb units, the existing gas system

is being upgraded to a combi boiler.

**(b)**

The ongoing energy efficiency upgrade programme has seen the introduction of air

source type heat pumps used to provide heating in 70 homes in areas where piped

natural gas is not available. These heating systems do not use traditional fossil fuels

to run and so are much more environmentally friendly. They use the same principle

as the domestic fridge in reverse, extracting energy from the air and using this energy,

with compressed refrigerant gas, to generate heat inside the home. Even if the air

outside is very cold, heat pumps can still be effective. Proof of this is the fact that 20%

of Swedish homes are heated by heat pumps. The systems work best with highly

insulated homes where heat loss is minimised. When combined with electricity

producing photovoltaic solar panels, the cost of running an air source heat pump is

further reduced.

There are two types of air source heating deployed on this project. Air to air heat

pumps provide space heating only and are more suited to smaller homes, typically less

than 100m2. Air to water heat pumps provide both space and hot water and are

suitable for larger homes. Both systems incorporate an external fan and compressor

unit, which is usually placed at the rear of the property and looks like an air

conditioning unit.

The heat pumps provided on this project are sourced from Mitsubishi Electric who are

a global market leading environmental technologies manufacturer. The efficiency of

heat pumps varies between 300% and 400% as opposed to conventional heating

systems, which operate at 75% to 92% efficiency. This means significant savings can

be made on fuel bills.

Full training on the use of the new systems will be provided to all residents during

testing and commission of the systems. In addition full maintenance back up will be

provided by Operations and Maintenance staff and their supporting contractors.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to the heating systems that are currently

in place in Local Authority houses and requested that more affordable heating systems be put

in place.

14.

Correspondence

Correspondence as circulated was noted by the Members.

The following items were also raised.

The ongoing issue of river erosion at the Town Park, Abbeyfeale, was raised and following

discussion, it was agreed that Irish Water would be invited to attend an onsite Meeting with

An update was sought on whether the Newcastle West Community Centre new car park could

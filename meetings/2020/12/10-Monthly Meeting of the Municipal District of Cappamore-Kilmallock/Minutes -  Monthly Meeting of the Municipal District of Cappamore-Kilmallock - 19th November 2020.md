Following the rejection of the Part 8 Planning Application for Phase 1 of the proposed Fire

investigate and have clear understanding of the following:

• The requirements of a local business and their request for additional land and how

this will affect the viability of the Training Centre;

• The requirements of Local Businesses in relation to smoke emissions from the

Training Centre.

Once the Fire Service receives a clear understanding from these businesses, it will review

these requirements and see if these requests can possibly be accommodated prior to

committing the Council to expenditure on design fees.

Any future Part 8 Planning Application submission, which may be lodged, encompassing

both Phase 1 and Phase 2, will be subject to the completion of an extensive design and

would require the appointment of a design team. It is envisaged that this process could

take at least 12 months to complete.

**Proposed: Councillor Egan;**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan.**

**Reply:**

Limerick City and County Council via the LCDC have allocated €510,056.79 under the LEADER

Programme 2014-2020 and €3,280.27 under the Community Enhancement Programme for

Community Buildings/Centres to Pallasgreen Templebraden Community Council. The

current 2014-2020 LEADER Programme will end this year. The programme for Government

includes a commitment to prioritise a State-Led programme to bridge the gap between the

current LEADER programme and the next EU Programme. The objective of this commitment

is to allow local- led rural development projects to be delivered under a transitional

programme until the new EU programme commences.

An extra €4million nationally has been provided for LEADER in Budget 2021 by the

Government to bring the total allocation for 2021 to €44million. This allocation will be used

to fund a combination of existing projects as they come into completion, for new projects to

be approved under the transitional programme and to support the administration of costs

of the LAGs in closing out the existing programme and delivering the transitional

programme. The Department of Rural Community Department have yet to inform the Local

Authorities and LCDCs of the transitional arrangements. The Council will continue to liaise

with the LEADER unit in the Department and provide any information once received.

Limerick City and County Council are not in a position to allocate any further funding to this

project from within its own resources.

13.

within the municipality that are not already equipped with a free Wi-Fi hotspot.

As of 4th of March 2019, we have secured through our ICT Department, four vouchers under

this scheme, one for each Municipal District, and one for the Metropolitan District in

Limerick City and County. In addition, the Department of Rural and Community

Development has committed to providing up to €15,000 in funding to each Local Authority

for every WiFi4EU voucher that they receive.

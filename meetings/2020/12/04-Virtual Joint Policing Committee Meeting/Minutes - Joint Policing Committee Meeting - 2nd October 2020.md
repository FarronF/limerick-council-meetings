90% of the extra resources from Templemore which were brought in to police the city and county

have now returned to Templemore.

The Chief Superintendent replied to Members queries as follows :

The Gardai would welcome any additional resources to help in the policing of Covid, however, said

people should be encouraged to comply with restrictions and to act with maturity and observe the

general rules when it comes to reducing the spread of the virus.

He confirmed that there has been no pedestrian fatalities so far this year. He added that the

however, any licensed premises in breach of the guidelines will be brought before the courts.

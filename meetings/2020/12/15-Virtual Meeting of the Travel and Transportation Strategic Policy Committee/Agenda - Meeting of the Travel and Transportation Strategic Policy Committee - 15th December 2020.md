“I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting, to request free car parking for Limerick

city to be enacted for one year, when Limerick is ready for reopening (which is now)

after this Covid-19 pandemic. I believe that to bring footfall back into our city,

shoppers should be given 3 hours free car parking at any time of the day to help

retailers”.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors B. Collins and E. Ryan;**

***We will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately set up an***

***SME Task*** ***Force to support and plan for the future of all SME’s throughout Limerick City and***

***County and that this Task Force should also feed into the Economic Forum***

On the proposal of Cllr. B. Collins, seconded by Cllr. Ryan, it was unanimously agreed that Limerick

City and County Council immediately set up an SME Task Force to support and plan for the future of

SME’s throughout Limerick City and County and that this Task Force should also feed into the

Economic Forum.

Mr. Moran, Chair of SME Recovery welcomed the Notice of Motion to set up a Task Force to

support SME’s and stated that it would provide a single agency to pull all supports together.
---
He stated SME’s had suffered an estimated €10-11 billion damage due to Covid-19 restrictions,

after taking into account the various schemes offered by the Government. He also stated that

there were 800,000 employees working in SME’s who are currently not supported by a single

government agency.

He felt that it would be a great opportunity for Limerick to take the lead in setting up this Task

Force for SME’s and that a proper infrastructure and supports were required to be put in place to

progress this initiative.

The Task Force would also be able to make submissions to feed into the National Recovery Plan.

Mr. Moran stated that €3.5bn had been allocated to the National Recovery Plan which will provide

for the setting up of co-working centres across the country, mentoring for SME’s and assessing

viability for grants.

V. Murray informed the meeting that further examination would have to take place on how to

approach the setting up of this Task Force, whether it will be a sub-committee of the Strategic

Policy Committee or by a working group established through Innovate Limerick.

A number of members expressed interest in sitting on this group and looked forward to working

together in supporting SME’s.

It was agreed that a submission be sent on behalf of the SPC to the National SME Task Force in

support of the SME sector.

**Item 3**

**Update of Proposed Limerick Development Plan**

M. Woods, A/Senior Planner updated members on the first consolidated Limerick

Development Plan, that will shape the future growth of Limerick for the period 2022-2028

and beyond. It is a blueprint/roadmap for Physical, Economic and Social Development for

Limerick. It will set out the overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable

development of Limerick City and County.

Maria gave an overview of the various stages of the Development Plan process from pre-draft

stage to adoption of the Plan in May 2022. The following works have been completed to date:

 Public Consultation on 1st issues paper ran from 15th Aug - 12th Oct 2020

and approximately 235 submissions were received

 Virtual Room was set up to allow public to access a virtual consultation

 Online Portal set up to allow public make submissions

 Webinar on proposed Development Plan was held on 17th Sept.

 Interactive Schools Programme for both primary and secondary schools – 170 packages

 Public Meetings were held by appointment in each Municipal District

 Stakeholder Meetings – over 30 meetings were held.

Maria also outlined the schedule of works for the next number of months which includes

issuing CE reports on consultation submissions, holding workshops with elected members

and preparation of the Draft Development Plan.
---
Further Plans which are being progressed by Forward Planning include:

 Southern Environs Local Area Plan – public consultation 10th Oct - 23rd Nov, 2020

 Supplementary Contribution Scheme – CE report being prepared for consideration at

November Council meeting.

In reply to members, Maria stated that no update had been received on Rural Housing

Guidelines and that the NPF and RSES sets out the main guidelines in relation to rural housing.

She stated that a workshop would be organised for elected members to discuss this matter

further.

She also confirmed that the current Development Plan will remain in place until the new

Development Plan is adopted and that all planning permissions will be subject to compliance

with the Development Plan along with the objectives of both the National Planning

Framework (NPF) and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES).

V. Murray assured members that an update of the Development Plan will remain as an item

on the agenda at further meetings and a copy of the presentation will be circulated to all

members.

**Item 4**

**Update of Living City Initiative(LCI)**

Mr. Kieran Reeves, Senior Exec Planner, Urban Innovation, presented an overview of the

Living City Initiative, which is a scheme of property tax incentives designed to regenerate both

historic buildings (pre 1915) and other buildings in city centres.

The Living Cities Initiative has two components residential and commercial:

 Residential offers income tax deduction over 10 years for qualifying expenditure on the

refurbishment or conversion of a building for use as a dwelling to owner/occupier.

 Commercial relief is given in the form of an accelerated capital allowance

for qualifying expenditure on refurbishment or conversion of rented residential and

certain commercial premises at the rate of 15% for 6 years and 10% in year 7.

The Urban Innovation Department hold monthly One-Stop Shops in Engine, Upper Cecil Street

giving multi-disciplinary advice to property owners, potential property owners and landlords

who want to avail of the tax incentive for qualifying renovation works.

Mr. Reeves informed members that the LCI Scheme expires at end of December 2022. He

stated that in Limerick, 31 applications had been received to date, 7 of which have been certified

and 3 have commenced development.

He also outlined the following initiatives which support the Living City Scheme:

 Positive City Exchange Project – examining ways of making historic buildings more

energy efficient and ways of financing them.

 URDF – Living Georgian City Initiative – 2 demonstrations projects at 58 O’Connell

Street and 33-34 Thomas Street.

 SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) – Fire Safety in historic buildings

Mentoring a small company to develop a new product to address compliance issues in

historic buildings.

While members thanked Kieran for the comprehensive presentation, they queried the low

level of take-up of the scheme, the timescale involved and if conservation restraints were

slowing down the process.
---
Kieran stated that the lack of access to finances for retrofitting schemes is the main factor in

the low level of take up of the scheme; he also stated that the availability of other grants

might make the scheme less attractive and they were looking at the viability of it. He stated

that there has been a recent increase in applications as more investors are purchasing

properties with a view to refurbishing them. Developments, which required planning

permission were more prolonged, but that advice given at One Stop Shops helped to speed

up the application process.

He informed members that they are currently working with colleagues in other Irish cities in

cataloguing techniques and best practices in the restoration of old buildings.

**Item 5**

**To consider Notice of Motion referred from Metropolitan District Meeting, held on 21st**

**September, 2020, submitted by Cllr. D. Butler;**

***I call Limerick City and County Council to look at developing a policy on how to enforce a***

***minimum standard of shop front signage to ensure the attractiveness of our city*.**

On the proposal of Cllr. Butler, seconded by Cllr. O’Sullivan it was unanimously agreed to develop a

policy on how to enforce a minimum standard of shop front signage to ensure the attractiveness of

Limerick City.

Members highlighted the lack of standardisation for shop fronts/signage, which was having a

detrimental effect on the overall appearance of Limerick City. They suggested that the scheme

should also be extended to the county and be part of the planning process, including enforcement.

Members also suggested the provision of a grant scheme for shop fronts / signage and guidance for

independent businesses to comply with the guidelines of the policy.

B. Thompson pointed out that Kerry County Council have a very good shopfront design policy.

V. Murray informed members that under the Development Management Guidelines,

recommendations for shop front facades and signage are currently being reviewed and updated

and will be incorporated into the proposed Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028, which will go on

public display next year.

He also stated that the Business and Retail Incentive Grant for fit-out costs for shop fronts would be

re-advertised by the Limerick Enterprise Office.

Replying to members, V. Murray stated that the delay in issuing of hoarding/scaffolding licences

would be investigated and that the licence fees incurred by commercial ratepayers would be

reviewed at budget time.

**Item 6**

**To consider Notice of Motion referred from adjourned Council meeting held on 3rd** **July, 2020,**

**submitted by Cllr. E. O’Brien;**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Chief Executive deliver the report and findings of the***

***Riverway Design Enabling Review, commissioned in June, 2017 and undertaken by Senior***

***Architect, Rosie Webb*.**

This Notice of Motion was deferred to the next meeting of the committee to be held on 14th

December, 2020.

**Item 7**

**To consider Notice of Motion referred from Council meeting held on 28th** **September, 2020.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. L.Galvin;**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council de-list all Protected Structures that fall under the***

***Derelict Sites Act for obvious reasons.***

Members expressed concern at the number of protected structures, which have fallen into

dereliction in towns and villages in Limerick, as the costs associated with refurbishing them are

enormous. They requested a review of the list of protected structures in Limerick.

S. Duclot informed members that there was currently 2,000 protected structures in Limerick, only

12 of which were listed on the Derelict Sites Register, (5 owned by Limerick City and County Council

and 7 privately owned, with active engagement with the Council on 6 of the 7 properties).

As part of the review of the Development Plan, M. Woods stated that they will be preparing a full

list of protected structures per Municipal District area and members will have an opportunity to

make submissions on protected structures in their areas and have them reviewed.

Members requested that sufficient resources be made available for research work to be carried out

on Protected Structures and assistance be provided to owners of protected buildings, whether to

invest or not. They also suggested that the criteria for placing properties on the register needs to

be reviewed and should be consistent with Departmental Guidelines.

V. Murray proposed that this Notice of Motion be deferred until the review has taken place and

suggested that it be placed as an item on agenda at a further meeting.

M. Lyes requested that members of the Environment Linkage Group be given an opportunity to

feed into this discussion.

**Item 8**

**Any Other Business**

Members congratulated Limerick City and County Council, which had been shortlisted for 10

Chambers Ireland Excellence in Local Government Awards for 2020.

The ‘*Atlantic Edge European Embrace’* brand, which was launched earlier this year, has also been

nominated as a finalist in three categories in the City Nation Place awards. Limerick is the only Irish

entrant to make the shortlist in this competition.

Best Wishes were extended to all entrants.

That concluded the business of the meeting.

**To receive a presentation from Mr. John Moran on the following Report**

**“Supporting Limerick’s SMEs** **through** **Challenging Times and Change”**

The Chairperson thanked all those who were involved in the preparation and drafting of the

Report which sets out how the state and local government can support SME’s through the

current crisis and how best to help them in a sustainable future.

The Chairperson called on Mr John Moran who compiled the report in association with

other stakeholders to make a presentation to the meeting.

He outlined the scale of the crisis for Irish SME’s and local businesses. The success of local

business is critical to the local economy as well the community fabric it supports. A Plan to

support business in the immediate crisis and in the short/medium term is urgently required.

The Tánaiste has established a National SME Growth Task Force to set out the policy aspects

of an SME recovery plan. A local implementation plan is also required to implement the

national policies. The Supporting Limerick’s SMEs through Challenging Times and Change

Report attempts to marry the national efforts with local actions.

The report sets out a five guiding principles in supporting the SME sector;

 Acknowledgement of the key role SMEs have in our social fabric

 Navigating the new normal is vital for SMEs

 Supports should be streamlined and easy to process

 Education and upskilling are vital to underpin a more robust future

 Successful SMEs need to be financially resilient

A number of recommendations with short and medium actions were laid out in the Report---
1. *Make supporting SMEs a key priority for the local economy*. Actions include the

mapping of all businesses across Limerick; regular reporting on SME performance

to SPC; setting up of a local SME RecoveryTask Force etc.

2. *Extra Support for SMEs to navigate the new post COVID Normal*. Actions include

the appointment of a Digital Innovation Mentor; develop a hub and spoke model

of co-working locations; seek out new markets; promote a network of local

farmers markets

3. *Develop a Single Umbrella Government Support Agency for S*MEs. Actions include

a National Policy Agency; Local implementation structures, one-stop shop SME

support facilities.

4. *Enhance Training and Upskilling Opportunities and Support with SMEs in mind*.

Actions include basic financial literacy training; greater use of the apprenticeship

and scholarship models; schools/ colleges entrepreneurial programmes

5. *Establish an SME Culture of Long Term Planning and Financial Resilience*. Actions

include the establishment of a COVID Support Team; enhanced business advisory

and support network; local SME Finance Task Force

In relation to local governance the Local Task Force would report to the Mayor; the Chief

Executive would Chair a group of State Agency Support bodies; and local thematic groups

would be established e.g. hospitality, funding, training, etc. to support the Local Task Force.

Mr Moran stated that if Limerick undertook these roles successfully there is no reason why

Limerick and the Mid-West Region could not pilot the national approach to supporting

SMEs.

The members spoke in support of the recommendations contained in the Plan. They spoke

of the incredible contribution local businesses make to their communities and that they

must be supported.

Members particularly welcomed the proposals for one–stop shops for SMEs and the

marketing/branding of Limerick as a business location. Members strongly urged the public

to support local businesses by shopping local.

Financial planning was seen as a key skill to be adopted by local business. Members stressed

the importance of e-commerce to all types of businesses and the ability to use technology

to their advantage.

Members welcomed the proposal to establish a Local Task Force to support SMEs. The

provision of co-working hubs across Limerick was seen as very important to sustain local

communities as well as giving employees the option of working locally.

There was a call to streamline the assistance programme to SMEs. Ease of access to

supports will encourage more businesses to seek support.

Members stressed that the focus should now be on getting businesses re-opened. They were aware

that there is a shortage of trained skilled workers in certain areas like construction, hospitality etc.

training /upskilling courses need to be directed at these sectors to ensure that the local labour

market can be satisfied by local people.

On the proposal of Cllr B Collins and seconded by Cllr J Scanlan it was agreed unanimously to accept

the recommendations as set out in the plan. It was further agreed that the Limerick City & County---
Council would forward their endorsement of the Plan to the National SME Growth Task Force for

their consideration**.**

Mr V Murray thanked all those who had contributed to the drafting of the plan and all those who

had contributed in today’s discussion. He undertook that following full Council support of the Plan

that a meeting would take place with the Mayor and the Chief Executive to progress those aspects

of the plan that were in the direct control of the Council. He looked forward to the outcome of the

National Task Force and assured members that Limerick was ready to play its role in supporting the

SME sector

On the proposal of Cllr. B. Collins seconded by Cllr. Scanlan, it was unanimously agreed that

Limerick City & County Council fully endorse the ‘Supporting Limerick’s SMEs through Challenging

Times and Change’ Report and that it be forwarded to the Minister for Enterprise Trade and

Employment, and the SME Growth Task Force for their consideration.

That concluded the business of the meeting.

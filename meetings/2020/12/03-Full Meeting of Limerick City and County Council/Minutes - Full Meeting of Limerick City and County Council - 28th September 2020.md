Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

I will ask at the next Meeting how many Council tenant evictions have taken place by Court

Order in the last five years due to Anti-Social Behaviour.

**REPLY:**

In addition to providing support to tenants and residents of local authority-

provided accommodation, through working with residents’ groups and

individuals, the Council’s Community Sustainment Unit is also responsible for

investigating complaints of anti-social behaviour. A new legislative code for

seeking repossession of properties was enacted in April 2015 on foot of

provisions contained in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.

Securing repossession orders on foot of anti-social behaviour through the

courts can be a slow and difficult process in terms of proving the case and the

scope for tenants to appeal decisions made at district court level to higher

courts. In any event, the Council takes the view that evictions in themselves, in

many cases, may not always be the appropriate solution in that innocent

parties, particularly children, may suffer unduly for the actions of one or two

individuals. This is not to say that the eviction route is not pursued where

deemed to be warranted. In the five years since September 2015, six (6)

properties were repossessed on foot of court orders. In only one of these cases

had the tenants to be formally evicted with the assistance of the Sheriff and

An Garda Síochána. In four (4) of the other cases, the tenants vacated of their

own volition, and the remaining 1 (one) stands under appeal to the Circuit

Court.

Having regard to the foregoing, the Council has been very pro-active in using

other legislative tools in trying to curb anti-social behaviour. Section 3 of the

Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 enables Housing Authorities to

seek formal court orders (Excluding Orders) against individuals effectively

evicting them from their homes and estates for periods of up to three years.

These orders have proven to be particularly effective, with sentences of up to

twelve months imprisonment being imposed for breaches. Limerick City and

County Council has been to the forefront among local authorities in utilising

this particular legal mechanism. In the five-year period under question, the

Council secured twelve (12) such Orders, the most recent being two weeks

ago, with three (3) other applications likely to proceed before the end of the

year.

Section 20 of the Act referred to above provides that, where Gardaí have been

advised by a Housing Authority that a person is illegally residing in a Council

house, and that person is believed to be engaged in anti-social behaviour, then
---
18

that person can be directed by An Garda Síochána to leave the house

immediately. Failure to comply with such a request is a criminal offence and

an offender can be arrested and charged. The Council has availed of this

provision in quite a number of instances in the past five years.

In almost all formal enforcement proceedings that the Council initiates, it relies

quite heavily on close co-operation with An Garda Síochána, and this

partnership approach is vital going forward in trying to curb anti-social

behaviour.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

**I will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed update on the application by Limerick City and**

**County Council to the NTA for funding for safety measures on Hyde Road and how long it**

**will take to get a decision on this application.**

**REPLY:**

A formal application for this scheme has been made to the National Transport

Authority (NTA) following detailed discussions with the NTA on the issues

particular to this site. The Council has been advised to include the proposal in

the next tranche of sustainable transport projects and the scheme has been

listed in the NTA short-term plan for action. Once formal approval is issued,

the preliminary options/design and planning process will begin without

delay. At this stage, it is reasonable to expect construction on site in mid-2021.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I** **will ask at the next Meeting if this Council canuse its new powers under the Derelict Site**

**Act against the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board regarding the maintenance**

**of the Convent of Mercy, Abbeyfeale.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council will arrange to carry out an inspection on the

site at the Convent of Mercy, Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick, and an update will be

provided to the Elected Members as soon as possible.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for the number of voids by Local Electoral Area in the**

**Metropolitan District and the Municipal Districts, the cost involved in refurbishment and**

**the turnaround time for each void to come back into stock.**

**REPLY:**

**T**he monthly housing newsletter contains the number of voids completed by

electoral area. The latest copy of the Housing Development Newsletter

contains the most up-to-date information.

Information in relation to costs per unit is not published due to commercial

sensitivity. However, the following information in available via the NOAC

Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an updated list of the number of vacant commercial**

**premises in the Metropolitan District.**

**REPLY:**

There are 7,625 premises listed as commercial, of which 981 are estimated as

vacant. Therefore, a vacancy rate of 12.8% applies to commercial properties

in the Metropolitan District.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an overview of the process by Limerick City and County**

**Council around notifying Elected Representatives of individual housing allocations by email;**

**and to specify the Elected Representatives these emails are sent to and the rationale for**

**this practice.**

**REPLY:**

The process around notification of Councillors regarding allocations is

something that has been raised previously and is considered a courtesy to the

Public Representatives for the area. We are happy to review the process in

detail at the next Housing Workshop where all Members can put forward their

views and collectively agree a strategy in dealing with this matter going

forward.

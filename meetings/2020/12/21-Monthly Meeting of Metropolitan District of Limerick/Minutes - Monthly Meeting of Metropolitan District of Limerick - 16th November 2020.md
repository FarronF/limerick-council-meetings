**QUESTIONS**

**5.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next meeting when works will commence at Peafield Road, Monaleen on the***

***extension of the footpath.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council anticipate works will commence in March / April

2021 at Peafield Road, Monaleen on the extension of the footpath.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***Can you advise when the field in Castletroy Park that is used by Aisling Annacotty will be drained***

***as it is waterlogged every time it rains.***

**REPLY**:

The Council installed drainage in this area approximately six years ago. Due to

current levels of rainfall, it is proving difficult to keep the pitch completely free of

water at all times. The Council will however, keep it under review to see if further

works may be required.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting that the Council provide the costs of providing water supplies at***

***burial grounds as requested at the Environment SPC in 2016 and again at the Council Meeting of***

***the Metropolitan District held in January 2020.***

**REPLY**:

There are 267 burial grounds in Limerick, one quarter of which have a water supply.

The estimated costs of providing a new connection vary from approximately €5,000,

where a water main is located within 10m of a burial ground to approximately

€10,000 for 20m from a burial ground, increasing incrementally for every 10m

thereafter.

These costs are significant on the operational budgets for burial grounds and

resources are currently not available to fund the additional costs that would be

required to provide water connections to all burial grounds. The cost of water (Irish

Water charges) are also in the order of €100 per year, per burial ground.

Rainwater Harvesting Systems can be considered in some locations and have been

provided in a number of our burial grounds. This provides a more environmentally

friendly and sustainable solution. However, it is acknowledged that this solution is

not feasible for all locations, due to lack of infrastructure and water run off from

roofs.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting:***
---
4

***- if the boundary wall project for Mount St. Oliver Graveyard will proceed this year as committed;***

***- if the project is delayed until 2021, will the €100,000 allocation from the Development Levy Fund***

***still be there next year for this project;***

***- will the Council submit a Part 8 Planning Application for the boundary wall so that residents in***

***the area can have an input.***

**REPLY**:

The design for the project is being progressed by the Design and Delivery Unit. It is

expected that the project will go to tender end Q1/Q2 2021. Funding for this project

has been committed and will be available next year.

It is very likely that the project will require a Part 8 due to the increased scope of

works hence the tender timeline end Q1/Q2.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council will engage with Irish Water to***

***build a new fit for purpose septic tank for the 16 houses in Brookhaven, Montpelier outside**of***

***the flood zone and to decommission the current tank.***

**REPLY**:

Please note below the response received from Irish Water.

“Thank you for our email on behalf of Councillor Elena Secas in relation to her below

query.

This has been forwarded to the relevant Department for investigation and response.

Once we receive an update, a member of our team will be in contact with you. Your

Irish Water reference number is 57397 which you can keep for your own records.

I understand that this issue is a source of concern for both you and Councillor Secas,

please bear with us while this matter is being investigated. I trust you find the above

information satisfactory. Thank you for contacting Irish Water”.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask the Council to detail their progress in meeting the commitments in Section 3 of the Local***

***Authority Climate Action Charter signed up to last October, in particular in measuring carbon***

***impacts, developing and implementing a process for carbon proofing, and monitoring,***

***evaluating and annual reporting.***

**REPLY**:

Action 147 of the Climate Action Plan 2019 includes for, inter alia, the introduction

of a local authority Climate Action Charter. Section 3 of the Charter provides that

local authorities, with the support of Central Government, will undertake a wide

range of climate action activities including a commitment to reduce emissions by

30% and increase energy efficiency to 50% of the baseline year (2009) by 2030.

Action 4 of the Climate Action Plan provides for the publication of legislation – the

Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020, published in

early October 2020 and currently progressing through the Oireachtas – which will

give legal standing to the Climate Action Plan 2019.

Section 3 of the Bill – as it is currently constituted – states that “The State shall
---
5

pursue the transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy by the end

of the year 2050.”

Section 12 of the Bill - *Role of Local Authority* – provides for the insertion, after

Section 14 of the parent Act, of Section 14A which provides that the Minister shall

request local authorities to make a 5-year local authority climate action plan which

will specify mitigation and adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority,

within 18 months of the commencement of the Section. It is anticipated that

included in the climate action plan will be the mechanisms by which the local

authority intends to meet the emissions and energy efficiency targets contained in

the Climate Action Plan 2019. Ministerial guidance on the content and preparation

of the local authority climate action plan is provided for under Section 14A of the

Bill.

At a national level a process is underway to develop the methodology by which

public bodies will calculate their emissions reductions. It is likely that each local

authority will have to account for its emissions and energy reduction targets as part

of the climate action plans under Section 12 of the Bill, when enacted.

Notwithstanding the above, the Council continues to work towards meeting its 2020

energy reduction target of 33% against the baseline year and we would hope to have

substantially met this target by year end. Working through the internal Energy

Management Team we have implemented a number of projects and processes

relating to our Significant Energy Users (SEUs) – primarily Public Lighting, Transport

and Corporate Buildings - which will assist us in reaching the target.

The national Local Authority Public Lighting Energy Efficiency project, which is

currently out to tender, will, in part, support our efforts to reach the 2030 targets.

However, we will have to focus on actions under our other SEUs to meet the target.

The Climate Action Plan 2019 sets out options for how this may be achieved

including, for example, the transition to a low emissions fleet, or the upgrade of

corporate buildings.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask the Council to provide**an update on the Limerick Sustainable Energy and Climate Action***

***Plan, submitted as part of the Covenant of Mayors, including the two monitoring reports for***

***mitigation and adaptation actions, the updated emission inventory report to see the progress***

***made, any evaluation as to the success**or otherwise, and lessons learned from this plan**that***

***could be taken forward for future plans.***

**REPLY**:

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) was prepared in 2016 as

part of the application to the Covenant of Mayors. It has its genesis in the National

Energy Efficiency Action Plan (2009) and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan

2010, and is built on data sourced in the development of an energy and emissions

balance, prepared for the Council by the Limerick Clare Energy Agency, which

informed the development of the current City and County Development Plans.
---
6

The energy and emissions balance was a non-statutory exercise, which sought to

identify how much energy does Limerick require as a society and an economy; how

reliant is Limerick on imported fuels; and what are the environmental implications

of our current fuel use.

The figures used in the energy and emissions balance, and hence the SECAP, are

based on a statistical apportionment of SEAI national energy usage figures, and

relevant CSO data, using a methodology agreed with the SEAI Statistical Unit.

The targets set out in the SECAP are intended to be an attempt at burden sharing

national targets across sectors on the basis of government energy and emissions

targets, to a local county or municipal level. The SECAP then aims to provide a

picture of what would be required locally to achieve the national policy targets,

reflecting local strengths and resources.

It is proposed to review the SECAP in 2021, and the outcomes of the review will

inform the development of the local authority climate action plans provided for

under the Climate Action Plan Climate Action and Low Carbon Development

(Amendment) Bill 2020, which will cover both mitigation and adaptation measures.

Other lessons / benefits from the SECAP have been the recognition of Limerick as

Ireland’s first Lighthouse City and the European Green Leaf Award for broader

environmental practices, including energy and climate change.

Limerick City and County Council continues to work towards meeting its 2020 energy

reduction target of 33% against the baseline year and we would hope to have

substantially met this target by year end.

The Council secured the ISO 50001 energy management standard in 2019. Working

through the internal Energy Management Team we have implemented a number of

projects and processes relating to our Significant Energy Users (SEUs) – primarily

Public Lighting, Transport and Corporate Buildings - which will assist us in reaching

the target by year end.

Many of the actions in the SECAP, for which the Council is identified as the lead

stakeholder, are being or will be progressed under the EU Horizon 2020

+CityxChange project including, inter alia, smart grid solutions, the establishment of

community energy co-operatives, near zero energy buildings, smart travel

technologies, smart metering and urban renewable energy generation.

The forthcoming public lighting energy efficiency programme, and the development

of an enhanced sustainable transport network under the LSMATS will contribute to

reduction in energy usage and emissions, and will feed into the Council’s efforts to

meet its 2030 energy use and emissions reductions targets, the methodology of

which has yet to be finalised.

Funding for the broad range of energy and emissions related projects remains a

challenge, which, it is hoped, will be addressed by the government commitment to

carbon budgets in the forthcoming Climate Action and Low Carbon Development

(Amendment) Bill 2020.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a progress update on the Affordable Housing Scheme and what***

***is the projected timeline until it is open to applications.***

**REPLY**:

The Affordable Housing Scheme of priority was adopted by Full Council in November

2019. Limerick City and County Council currently are progressing five sites in the

city under the Service Site Fund to Part VIII planning by Q3 of 2021.

It is anticipated that Expressions of Interest will be advertised once planning is

granted for the unit types under the permission.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a full breakdown of the number of houses in Rhebogue broken***

***down by the number of HAP tenancies, RAS tenancies and Approved Housing Bodies and Council***

***houses.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council currently have tenancies in 90 houses in Rhebogue.

The breakdown is as follows:

Housing Assistance Payment tenancies

22

Rental Accommodation Scheme tenancies 33

Approved Housing Bodies tenancies

5

Council House tenancies

30

**14.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the Notice of Motion 21 referred to the Protocol***

***Committee at the September Full Council Meeting to erect a plaque on Wolfe Tone Street in***

***memory of the late Captain Thomas Keane.***

**REPLY**:

This matter was referred to the Protocol Committee. The Protocol Committee meets

prior to the Bi-Monthly Full Council Meeting. The next meeting is set for 3rd

December.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the number of horses seized in the Metropolitan***

***District in the last 12 months, the number of seized horses recovered, the number of horses***

***destroyed and the combined cost of employing the pound in the seizing horses over the last 12***

***months.***

**REPLY**:

**Horse Control Figures**

**1 October 2019 to 30 September**

**2020**

**Horses Seized**

129

**Recovered (released to owner)**

25
---
8

**Notes**:

Since January 2019 the usual method of disposing of seized horses is by rehoming to horse

charities. The Council only releases horses back to their owners if the owners meet the criteria as

set out in the Byelaws. These include applying for a horse passport (if none previously) and proof

by way of sworn affidavit that the horse owner owns or has rented land on which to keep the horse.

Also, the land must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as an

Equine Premises. The owner is obliged to pay for the cost of impounding the horse. If the horse

owner fails to make payment, the debt is pursued through the Courts. Under the Control of Horses

Act 1996, a horse seized three times in a twelve-month period can be confiscated by the Council.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor** **E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a detailed breakdown of works to be completed for successful***

***applicants under the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2020 in the Metropolitan District. Have***

***all successful recipients confirmed acceptance of funding and will there be a second round of***

***applications for this scheme.***

**REPLY**:

The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht allocated €118,000 to

Limerick City and County Council to operate the Built Heritage Investment Scheme

2020. A total of 48 applications were received of which 27 projects with qualifying

works were nominated forward to the Department for consideration.

Of 27 applications forwarded to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the

Gaeltacht for consideration, 11 were in respect of properties within the boundaries

of the Metropolitan District. All these made it through the Department’s screening

procedures and all the successful applicants confirmed acceptance of their funding

offers. Ultimately, within the Metropolitan District, 3 did not proceed. Of the

foregoing, 5 successful projects were awarded additional funding.

In addition, a further application was accepted in, in accordance with the terms and

conditions governing the operation of the Built Heritage Investment Scheme, for re-

roofing a thatched house.

Therefore, in total 9 historic properties within the boundaries of the Metropolitan

only become a permanent feature in the advent of Covid 19 in April 2020. Daily

statistics fluctuate significantly and I have provided a monthly snap shot to highlight

the extent of the problem as it is currently presented. We will review the correct

figure format and endeavour to include these figures going forward in the CE Report

as requested.

Please note that not all those on the waiting list are verified as rough sleepers.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the new Clonmacken development including a***

***timeline for completion and an explanation as to why the site is progressing so slowly.***

**REPLY**:

The Clonmacken development, comprising the construction of 43 no. social housing

units, is advancing with an anticipated completion date of Q1 / 2022. The project is

currently behind programme. Limerick City and County Council are liaising with the

contractor and Design Team on programme related issues which are being dealt

without delay and the construction period is 30 months.

A Stage 2 Scheme Appraisal for the Limerick Northern Distributor Road (LNDR) will

be forwarded to the Department of Transport week beginning 9th November, 2020,

which appraised the scheme as a whole and as various sub-schemes either side of

the Shannon Crossing. The Department will decide if the scheme as a whole, or

indeed a smaller sub-scheme, proceeds to the next Planning stage. It should be said

that eventual construction is several years away at this time.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council identify as a matter of urgency a suitable site for***

***a new cemetery for the wider area of Castletroy given that Kilmurry BG is at full capacity and***

***there is no another cemetery in this area.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed.

In proposing the motion Councillor Secas highlighted the urgent need for an additional cemetery

in the area. She stated the issue was particularly distressing for elderly people in the area who

wanted to be sure that they would be buried in the area where they live. Members pointed out

that private land owners can also develop private cemeteries. The meetings administrator Mr J.

Clune then read out the reply:

**REPLY**:

The Council are in the final stages of preparing a Draft Burial Ground and Interment

Strategy for its functional area. This will provide an evidence based strategy for the

need for new burial grounds in each Municipal / Metropolitan District. Workshops

with the Elected Members to discuss initial findings and research have already been

held in each District and the Community, Culture and Leisure SPC received a briefing

at its recent meeting on 9th November.
---
12

A draft strategy will now be finalised and brought to the February 2021 Meeting of

the Community, Culture and Leisure SPC for consideration before being brought to

the Full Council.

It is anticipated that the Burial Ground Strategy, if adopted, will inform the objectives

of the new Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028.

I also wish to advise that the Council are progressing a Columbarian Wall Project for

Kilmurray cemetery. In addition, Castleconnell cemetery is used as an alternative to

Kilmurray cemetery.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors S. Novak Uí Chonchúir and E. Secas**

***We will move at the next meeting that the Limerick Council write to Irish Rail and the**NTA to***

***request that they carry out an engineer's report on the Limerick to Ballybrophy rail track. There***

***has been 31 miles of continuous welded track laid over the past few years which should***

***have**resulted in an increase in speed. This hasn't happened. Increased speed is crucial to the***

***development and marketing of the line.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir, seconded by Councillor Secas and

agreed.

In proposing the motion Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir highlighted the need for a frequent, reliable

and fast train service on this route.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council undertake a campaign to encourage city***

***businesses to make an extra effort to decorate their windows in the run-up to Christmas, creating***

***an atmospheric city trail for families to enjoy and promoting retail footfall in the city as Covid-19***

***restrictions ease.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Sullivan, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Sullivan stated that the city trail initiative would be an event

that families would greatly enjoy and could become an annual event. The motion received broad

support. Ms. Larkin outlined the initiatives that are in place this year, in particular the “Walking in

the Window Wonderland” initiative around Limerick City Centre.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan (to be referred to the Economic**

**Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting of the Council that the Council develops a policy for***

***the taking in charge of estates to ensure that all estates are taken in charge within a defined***

***period of 7 years post completion.***

It was agreed to refer this motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic

Policy Committee.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council extend public park opening***

***hours from 7am to 7pm during Winter for Level 3-5 Covid restrictions.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Leddin and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Donovan outlined the need for safe areas that people can

exercise during Winter time, particularly for those living in apartments in the City.

Members supported the motion and requested that improvements to amenities in Parks and Open

Spaces would be looked at. The Director, Service Operations said the Council would look at the

feasibility of opening the parks earlier and later in the winter months but highlighted a number of

issues to consider.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council accepts tenants of Approved Housing Bodies***

***onto the local authority transfer list, where the Approved Housing Body is not in a position to***

***offer a suitable transfer, within their stock, in the cases of overcrowding, downsizing and medical***

***grounds.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Benson highlighted the need for greater co-operation and

engagement between the Local Authority and Approved Housing Bodies. The meetings

administrator Mr J. Clune then read out the reply:

**REPLY**:

Approved Housing Bodies are currently engaged in Local Authority transfers with

Limerick City and County Council and also other Approved Housing Bodies.

Approved Housing Bodies have the capacity to source specific housing based on

their own tenants needs as circumstances change during the lifecycle of a tenancy.

As a Council we encourage this as the first step in the process given the current

transfer pressures on Limerick City and County Council.

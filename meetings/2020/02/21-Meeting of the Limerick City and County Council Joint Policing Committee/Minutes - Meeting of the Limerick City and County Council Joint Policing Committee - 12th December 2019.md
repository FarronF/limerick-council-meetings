Ms. Feehily stated that her term as Chairperson of the Policing Authority comes to an end on 31st

December 2019. She thanked Members for their kind invitation to address the meeting and said she

was anxious to fulfil the invitation before she went out of office. She stated that she was the

designated Chair for the last five years during which time she oversaw the performance of An Garda

Siochana. She stressed the importance of feedback from members of the public and said that An

Garda Siochana cannot do it’s job without community support. She also stated that transparency is---
very important to ensure the public has confidence in it’s policing system and if there is public

confidence then there is community support. She welcomed the fact that the PPN members of the

victims of crime are related to and dealt with and this needs to be addressed in the future. She

**3.To Receive Presentation by Dr. Mihai Bilauca, Head of Digital Strategy and to approve**

**CCTV Policy**

Councillor A. Teskey returned to the meeting and took the Chair.

The Head of Digital Strategy gave a presentation on the Draft CCTV Policy for Limerick City and

County.

It was proposed by Councillor S. Keary, seconded by Senator M. Byrne and unanimously agreed to

approve CCTV Policy.

In reply to Members queries the Head of Digital Strategy replied as follows :

•

Prosecutions where CCTV footage was used are presently underway and no cases have been

struck out to date due to data protection.

•

Funding so far has been for hinterland projects and is based on crime levels. He added that

CCTV can also be used for covert surveillance which has been done and is still being used.

•

The retention of CCTV footage for 28 days is as per the guidelines issued by the Data

Protection Office and is what is operated throughout the country. This can be extended but

would need a strong case in order to do so.

•

Public consultation with people from the local community takes place prior to installation of

CCTV cameras.

•

CCTV can be used to review tenancies in relation to anti social behaviour.

•

Most of the CCTV cameras are monitored in Moyross and stated that he would issue an

invite to all the members of the Joint Policing Committee to visit the surveillance office in

Moyross.

•

Update of the CCTV Policy in one year’s time would be put on the Draft Works Programme.

**4.To receive update from Chief Superintendent**

The Chief Superintendent stated that policing of Limerick is challenging, however, the number of

serious incidents is lower than in previous years. Some road accidents can be linked to the use of

drugs so road policing is particularly important. A Christmas roads campaign would be in progress.---
He added that the number of drug testing is increasing all the time, most of which comes from

mobile patrols. More people are trained and becoming more proficient in drug detection and

Limerick will have the highest number of staff in the traffic unit in the country. He appealed to

everybody to take care over the Christmas period and appealed to the public representatives to

reiterate this within their communities. He stated that the Garda Youth Awards took place on 21st

November, 219 and there were ten award winners.

The Senior Crime and Policing Analyst then gave a brief overview on statistics under the following:

•

Property crime – down 7% compared with same period in the Division last year;

•

Non aggravated burglary – down 15% compared with same period in the Division last year;

•

Crime against the Person – down 3% compared with same period in the Division last year;

•

Overall assaults – same as last year

•

Proactive policing measures

•

Recent community events

**5.Update from The Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris on the Garda Operating Model**

The Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, thanked the Chairman and Members for their warm

welcome. He confirmed that the Limerick Garda Division will be one of the first in the country to

fully implement the new policing model which is being rolled out nationwide. He stated that the

current district led model will be replaced with a divisional model which, it was hoped, would lead to

a greater amount of gardai being assigned to front line duties. He stated that community policing

would be at the centre of the new model once it was rolled out and should result in a more effective

and efficient police service for Limerick. He added that the implementation process began last

week and it was expected the new model would be in place before the end of the year.

Mr. Harris informed members that the new model, which is based on international best practice,

would allow for more specialism locally, particularly in relation to vulnerable victims and cyber

crime. For the first time a duty inspector would be rostered twenty four hours a day while the

number of inspectors and sergeants was set to increase in the coming weeks. A Detective Inspector

was being appointed to the Protective Services Unit and a Detective Superintendent will be

responsible for the investigation of serious crime across the division. He pointed out that the new

model will improve the policing service that is provided in Limerick and provide more specialism in

terms of both protecting the public from crimes against the vulnerable and the investigation of

serious crime and also a concentration on community policing through community engagement

hubs. He stated that Henry Street Garda Station would remain the divisional headquarters and two

community engagement hubs would be established, one for the city and one for the county. He

stated that under the new model, every garda division in the country will be ‘operationally

autonomous’ subject to compliance with some national guidelines and policies and will be rolled out

on a phased basis.

Commissioner Harris said that Gardai must respond accordingly to tackle drug gangs who, it’s

claimed, are using children to distribute their illegal product. He added that he recognises what a

scourge this is on local communities in respect of drug dealing and in particular street level dealing

and said that the Gardai are determined to combat that. However, he said he believed the gangs

methods of maintaining fear has not caused a negative impact on the Garda’s relationship with

communities, which is a relationship largely built upon the flow of information from sources on the

ground, because people can see the work that is being done by An Garda Síochána. He stated that

Gardaí are committed to policing critical neighbourhoods which require a strong policing presence

so that people can live without the fear of crime and the fear of these gangsters and their behaviour.---
Commissioner Harris replied to Members queries as follows :

•

Go Save vans were under utilised and could be more effective and should be in accident

black spots, he said to give details of locations to Chief Superintendent Roche. He said that

there are more than 164 speed detection devices and Gardai themselves have mobile

detection devices. These can scan licence plates also and work well in the detection of

speeding. There are constant technology advances all of which are used successfully.

•

There will be 160 promotions in Limerick before Christmas and the number of sergeants is

growing which will make a significant difference to combating crime.

•

The Gardaí have a commitment to Community Policing Framework and a lot of cross agency

work was being done in some areas.

•

The proposed new model is in existence for twenty years and is used in New Zealand,

Denmark and parts of Australia, it involves less bureaucracy and is therefore more

successful.

•

Garda resources are being used to provide security in Courthouses and transfer of

prisioners. There are a number of elements in the ‘Commission on Future Policing’ Report

about removing Gardaí from non core police duties and that includes security at court

buildings.

•

575 Gardaí are already assigned to front line duties and the overall number has to grow by

another 700. Next year’s budget reflects such growth.

•

He stated that he wished to maintain existing Garda Stations and to repopulate stations that

are only open once a week. He said he was mindful of population growth but that it was a

matter for divisional and regional areas.

•

It is important to build relationships and develop trust with people living in our communities

who are from other areas of the world. 2,000 Garda Reserves will be recruited within the

next two years some of whom will be from more diverse communities.

•

Limerick has a critical need for community policing and this is recognised at national level.

Intimidation is very prevalent and complaints which were made have been successfully

brought through the courts system. He stated that it is doing a community an injustice by

not reporting crime and trust in the policing system was very important.

•

A lot of work was being done throughout the country in tackling the drugs epidemic with

increased detection and targeting of gangland drug dealers. It is very much an enforcement

function and stressed the importance of education.

•

He assured Members that additional Gardaí would be deployed to Limerick for the Christmas

period and traffic issues at the Crescent Shopping Centre would be addressed.---
•

There is ongoing commitment to policing rural areas and the importance of local Gardaí

living in the area was recognised. Some stations have living quarters, however, the

Commissioner said he was not sure if Gardaí posted to an area would live in such quarters.

It was important that Gardaí make an impact in areas and to be particularly active at

nightime in the prevention and detection of crime.

•

There are more Garda staff now than ever before and frontline Gardaí have increased. The

demand on the Gardaí is becoming more complex and demanding. He agreed in relation to

visibility of Gardaí in areas to improve quality of life for the public.

•

He assured Members that Limerick will receive it’s fair share of the increased resources

adding that the increased population will be taken into consideration in relation to new

Garda stations. He added that small villages and towns have grown in population also and

garda resources will have to grow also in these areas.

The Chairman thanked Commissioner Harris for addressing the Joint Policing Committee.

Commissioner Harris left the meeting at this stage.

**6.Question submitted by Senator M. Byrne:**

“In light of the allocation of €81 million for 700 new Garda recruits in Budget 2020, I ask Garda

Commissioner Drew Harris when will the 26 Gardaí in the Henry Street Policing Division that have

been promoted to higher ranks be replaced”.

Of the 26 promoted to date Limerick has received 24 and all competitions have not yet concluded.

Since the last JPC Meeting 6 Gardai have been promoted to Sergeant, two have been retained in the

Division and an additional six has been received which saw an increase of 2 sergeants.

**7.Notice of Motion submitted by Senator M. Byrne:**

“I will move at the December 2019 Meeting of Limerick City and County Council Joint Policing

Committee that this Committee will call on the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris to provide a full

time Garda Station in the vicinity of Castletroy to serve the policing needs of the wider Limerick East

Community”.

The Chief Superintendent stated that the Garda Commissioner is looking at the provision of new

Garda Stations throughout the country and a decision on same will be based on population growth.

The priority at present is to have Castleconnell Garda Station fit for purpose. No funding has been

allocated for a new garda station in Castletroy.

**8.Notice of Motion submitted by Senator M. Byrne:**

“I am calling on the Chief Superintendent to make sure that there will be sufficient Gardaí on patrol

on the streets of Limerick City over the Christmas shopping period to ensure that shoppers can go

about their business without any hassle or fear”.---
As previously mentioned Operation Open City was up and running throughout the city and in

Newcastle West for the Christmas period. In addition to Operation Open City, Operation Meirle and

the Community Policing Units, special emphases has been placed on maximising resources on unit

cross overs. This will ensure more Gardai are on the streets at critical times thus ensuring higher

visibility and a greater presence. Overtime was incurred throughout the Christmas Period to ensure

greater visability.

Detective Sergeant Ted Riordan spoke about cyber fraud and outlined some of the ways in
which criminals are defrauding people out of money. This included incidences where criminals
hacked into a company’s IT system and demand money while threatening to reveal a
business’s bank details and other commercially sensitive information to other criminals if
money is not paid. In other instances, fraudsters set up an e-mail address very similar to the
business’s one. They then e mail a company or person that has a direct debit set up, advising
that they have a new bank account and asking them to redirect payments to the new account
set up. Detective Riordan advised people to always question any new change and if in doubt,
to ring the company involved to verify things.

Superintendent Ryan confirmed that following the recent successful event in Cappamore on
rural security, crime prevention and well-being, that it was hoped to run a similar event in
Ballylanders in early 2020. Superintendent Ryan also outlined details of an open day being
held in Bruff Garda Station on the 23 November and gave details of a presentation a
commercial company would be doing at the Open Day for an etching machine that could etch
ownership details, such as name and Eircode information, etc, on equipment and personal
items of value to people.

The Elected Members thanked the Superintendent and Detective Sergeant for their
presentations, and welcomed the reduction in crime in certain categories and noted the
increase of incidences of fraud and drug driving in particular. They agreed that it was essential
that people remained vigilant, especially in relation to fraud, cybercrime, and the importance
of contacting their bank if they had any suspicions about an unexpected call or e-mail relating
to their bank account.

The Elected Members also complimented An Garda Siochana on the recent event in
Cappamore on rural security and welcomed the fact that another event was being planned
for Ballylanders, as well as the forthcoming Open Day taking place in Bruff Garda Station.
The Elected Members complimented An Garda Siochana for the recent drugs seizure in the
area, and stressed the importance of continued activity by An Garda Siochana in tackling drug

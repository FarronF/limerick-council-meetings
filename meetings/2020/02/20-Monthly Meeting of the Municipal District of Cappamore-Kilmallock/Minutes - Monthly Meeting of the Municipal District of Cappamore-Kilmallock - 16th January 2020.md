been circulated to the Elected Members. He went through the difficulties and issues
encountered by their communities in the recent past, and outlined the work carried out to

3. Cork Line Level Crossings Project

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the representatives from Irish Rail and Jacobs Consultants to

Crossings Project, and in particular on the details relating to the level crossings at Fanstown
and Thomastown. They outlined details of the public consultations and public meetings held
to date and confirmed that the closing date for receipt of submissions in relation to this
current public consultation was the 21* January, 2020.

The Elected Members thanked the representatives for their presentation in relation to the
project, and in particular, the information provided in relation to the level crossings at
Fanstown and Thomastown. With regard to the Fanstown level crossing, they referred to
concerns raised by the local community about the lengthy diversion involved and that the
community was being split in two with the suggested closure of this railway crossing. They
asked that consideration should be given instead to the provision of an overbridge at this
location.

Concerns were also raised in relation to unauthorised parking and dumping on the section
of road that would be closed at the level crossing. The Elected Members expressed
disappointment that Limerick City and County Council had not formally been involved in the
consultation process and agreed that more consultation and engagement should take place
with the local community.

The Elected Members also suggested that factors other than the cost of the provision of an
overbridge, such as impacts on the local community and increased traffic commute times,
should be considered as part of any process and they cited examples elsewhere of
overbridges being provided where level crossings were being closed. The Elected Members
unanimously agreed that Irish Rail should be asked to review their proposals and instead
consider the provision of an overbridge at Fanstown level crossing.

With regard to the Thomastown level crossing, the Elected Members referred to a recent
meeting involving the community and some local Councillors where the proposal to provide
an overbridge at this location was discussed. It was noted that there was a reasonably
positive reaction to the proposal but that some clarifications were being sought. These
included the width of the proposed road carriageway, measures to address unauthorised
parking and dumping on the section of road that would be closed at the level crossing,
possible provision of a footpath on the overbridge and what weight restrictions would be
proposed for the overbridge, etc. The Elected Members highlighted the importance of
ongoing engagement with the local community by Irish Rail to ensure all concerns raised
were addressed.

The representatives from Irish Rail noted the issues raised by the Elected Members and
confirmed that these would be taken into consideration as part of the consultation process.
The Elected Members agreed that it would be worthwhile to invite Irish Rail back again in
the near future to give a further update on developments with regard to the level crossings
at Fanstown and Thomastown.

4. Ballyhoura Development CLG

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the representatives from Ballyhoura Development CLG who
gave a presentation to the Elected Members on the social economic plans completed by
communities across the Municipal District. They outlined the consultation process that they
engaged in with local communities and the methodology used in the preparation of the
plans for each area.

The Elected Members thanked the representatives from Ballyhoura Development CLG for
their presentation and acknowledged the work being done by Ballyhoura Development CLG
in local communities. They agreed the importance of continued co-operation between

The Environment Section of the Council has responsibility for tackling problems associated
with the illegal parking of horses on public lands. Housing Support Services assist, should
ownership of horses be traced back to Council tenants. Discussions have been held with
residents in Deebert and Cois Abhainn estates regarding the possibility of closing or
restricting access points in the vicinity of both and it is hoped that proposals can be
developed which will have the support of the majority of residents and Elected Members.

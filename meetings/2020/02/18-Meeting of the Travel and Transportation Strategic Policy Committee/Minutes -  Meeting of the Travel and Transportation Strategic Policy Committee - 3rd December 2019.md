*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
1. Arrange workshop with Members on the outline proposals from the LSMATS:

Mr. Kennedy advised we are still awaiting sufficient information from the NTA on the
emerging corridors under the LSMATS in order to arrange a workshop with members. This
information should be available in mid-December. A workshop will then be arranged, most
likely in early Qtr. 1 2020.

2. Circulate the LSMATS Baseline Study:

Mr. Kennedy stated that the LSMATS is still under preparation, and the NTA has indicated that
the Baseline Study may still be subject to change as the study progresses. The NTA is finalising
an Advance Consultation Report which will summarise the work done by the Steering Group
to date, as well as the input from stakeholders. We hope to be in a position to circulate the
Advance Consultation Report to members when it is completed.

3. Discuss segregation of cyclists and walkers on the UL to City Centre Smarter Travel Route:

In reply to this query, Mr. Kennedy said the shared surface path has become established as
an important commuter route allowing people a viable alternative to regular private vehicle
use, which aligns with national smarter travel targets. Last year average weekday cyclist
numbers alone at the UL boathouse counter was 376; the vast majority of these are
commuters and indicate a reduction in vehicle based traffic.

He advised that this route was conceived, designed and constructed as a shared use route for
pedestrians and cyclists. The route is marked for both cycling and walking purposes, and
signage advising users to be considerate of other modes are prominently displayed at all
access points to the route. Neither cyclists nor pedestrians have priority on the route, and
any steps to give priority to one mode over the other would be in contravention of the terms
of the European funding.

4. Write to Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport seeking consideration of extending
penalty points to include illegal parking offences:

Mr. Kennedy confirmed that the Council has written to the Office of the Minister for
Transport, Tourism and Sport requesting that consideration be given to the proposal to
extend penalty points to cover certain illegal parking offences.

5. Develop proposals for actions to deal with illegal parking:

Mr, Kennedy confirmed LCCC have undertaken rehabilitation of bus stops in the form of
relining and retexturing to highlight the bus stop surface. He advised the following:

From ist January to date, 500 parking tickets have been issued for parking in omnibus bus
stops; from 1st January to date 120 parking tickets have been issued for parking in coach
parking areas; to date 80% of fines have been paid and the remaining 20% will be advanced
through the court system.

LCCC is engaging with An Garda Siochana in relation to illegal parking at out of hours times
where Traffic Wardens are not on duty. LCCC in conjunction with the NTA is undertaking a


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
transport strategy for the Metropolitan Area that will prioritise and enable a modal shift to
sustainable and active travel modes.

LCCC is also in the process of appointing an Active Travel Co-Ordinator. The position has been
vacant for a short period but LCCC hope to employ a Planner in Quarter 1 2020; the role will
involve promotion of the sustainable transportation brief.

It was confirmed by Mr. Kennedy that an extra 32 Gardai would be deployed to Limerick
temporarily until Christmas Eve to deal with traffic issues. Mr Kennedy is also meeting with
the Superintendent in the next couple of days.

He advised that there was a press release today launching Christmas Park and Ride facilities.
6. In response to query from Clir. Ryan regarding Duration for impounded vehicles
Mr. Kennedy advised that:

Section 17 - Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 states at sub-section (2): Where in a clamping place a
vehicle is relocated to a place where the owner of the vehicle cannot gain access to the vehicle,
the vehicle shall be released within such period as may be specified in clamping regulations
after payment of the relocation charge or its waiver.

Article 6 (a) of the Vehicle Camping and Signage Regulations 2017 states: Where payment of
the clamp release charge has been made in accordance with Regulation 14, the clamping
operator shall remove the clamp from the vehicle as soon as is practicable but not later than
two hours following receipt of payment.

Article 6 (b) states: Subject to paragraph (f) where a vehicle has been relocated to a place
where the owner of the vehicle cannot gain access to the vehicle, the vehicle shall be released
or available for release, as soon as is practicable, but not later than one hour following receipt
of payment of the relevant charge.

On the issue of illegal parking, the Chair expressed his ongoing concerns. He welcomed the
announcement by An Garda Siochana regarding the deployment of additional resources to
manage traffic for the Christmas period, but requested that the engagement with the Garda
would continue after the holiday period. He suggested looking at putting stickers on windows
of illegally parked vehicles.

The members welcomed the Garda Siochana announcement of additional resources and
commended the efforts of the Traffic Wardens to address the situation. Cllr. Leddin (B)
welcomed the commitment to engage with the Members on the LSMATS prior to the first
draft of the Strategy issuing. He also welcomed confirmation that a Sustainable Travel
Coordinator will be appointed shortly.

Clir. O'Donovan requested that the Director's response to the query on the Smarter Travel
Route to UL be circulated to the members.

appointment of consultants.

The members thanked Mr. Slavin for the update.

Referring to the proposed Park Road Bridge, Clir. O'Hanlon stated that local residents had
expressed concerns to him that the proposals would result in additional traffic volumes in
Lower Park and Rhebogue, and queried whether the project should go ahead if an alternative
solution could be achieved.

Cllr. B Leddin echoed Cllr. O’Hanlon’s comments with regard to Park Road Bridge, and asked
whether discussions had been held with the LSMATS consultants regarding O'Dwyer Bridge
and it’s interaction with the CFRAMS scheme.

Cllr. Butler requested that consideration be given to junction treatments on the Raheen to
Quinn’s Cross Roundabout and St. Paul’s to Quinn’s Cross Roundabout Schemes to ensure
safety of young and vulnerable road users. He asked that local area members be briefed when
designs are being considered for these schemes.

Clir. O'Donovan asked whether there was 2 cost to the Council for the re-design of the
Wickham Street cycle lane. She also requested that where the Council is doing works,
consideration should be given to the effect the works could have on residents and service
users in the area, and that people are notified of the works in advance. She also asked that
members could see the preliminary plans for the MIC to City Centre scheme. The Chair agreed
that lessons learned from the Pamell Street scheme should be incorporated into planning for
the O'Connell St. and future schemes.

In response to the members, Mr. Gallagher advised that the height restriction on the Park
Road railway bridge would be reduced by half a metre as a result of the proposed works. This
would restrict heavy traffic on the new route. Traffic counts in preparation of the scheme
recorded approximately 1,700 journeys per day, and substantial additional journeys were not
anticipated. He noted that the scheme would have to go to Part 8, and there would be an
opportunity to discuss issues at that juncture. Cllr. Ryan (M) suggested that a weight
restriction would also be applied to the Park Road to prevent heavy goods vehicles using the
road. Mr Gallagher agreed that this could be considered.

Mr. Gallagher informed the members that there will be ongoing interaction between the
CFRAMSs projects and the LSMATS. He advised that, where feasible, it was the intention to
provide for enhanced public realm on the embankments being developed under the CFRAMS.

Mr. Gallagher said that subject to confirmation from Design and Delivery Unit, it was his
understanding that there was no additional cost to the Council arising from the Wickham

Street cycle lane works. He also said that the design of the MIC to City Centre Cycle Lane
Scheme will commence in 2020, and that there will be consultation as part of the scheme.

Mr. Gallagher advised that the Council is aware of the traffic Issues at the Raheen to Quinn’s
Cross to St. Paul’s scheme, and advised that at future Design meetings Clir, Butler's comments
will be considered.

Mr. Gallagher briefed the members on progress with the Limerick Northern Distributor Road
(LNDR). He advised that while the LNDR was not included in the National Development Plan,
its importance to the region was acknowledged in the document. The Council has met with
DTTAS and NTA in the context of LSMATS and the LNDR. While the LNDR will primarily be
dealt with by DTTAS, it is LSMATS will acknowledge the mutual benefit of the LNOR assisting
the aims of LSMATS.

Mr. Gallagher advised that the scheme consultants are currently finalising an Appraisal Report
for the scheme, which will have to be submitted to DTTAS for review. The report will look at
the scheme in 3no distinct elements: (i) Limerick side (ii) Clare side and (iii) river crossing. He
advised that the total scheme is estimated to cost between €180M and €200M. DTTAS has
indicated that there may be funding to construct one element of the scheme, subject to the
outcome of the appraisal process. Essentially, the most cost beneficial element could be
advanced to Planning/CPO and advanced to construction, should funding allow. He saw this
as a positive development as it indicated a path forward for the scheme.

He stated that the construction tender documents for Phase Il of the Coonagh to
Knockalisheen scheme should be advertised in early 2020.

The Chair welcomed the update and said that he had been hearing concerns from residents
and businesses regarding the timeframe for the LNDR. Mr. Gallagher responded the
timeframe for the submission of the Appraisal Report was early 2020. It will include a cost
benefit analysis of each of the 3no elements. He anticipated that it could take 9 to 12 months
to get to planning following the outcome of the appraisal process.

Cllr. O'Hanlon stated that a recent IBEC report had identified the threat of traffic congestion
to job creation, and expressed the belief that the road needed to be advanced as soon as
possible. He proposed that the committee write to the Minister seeking a meeting with an
all-party delegation of members, accompanied by officials, to secure a commitment from
Government for the LNDR. The proposal was seconded by Clir Ryan (M).

Cllr. Leddin (B) stated that chartered transport planners had expressed their concerns to him
regarding the LNDR in that it would encourage more traffic, rather than reduce It. He said the
scheme ran contrary to the National Development Plan policy on development of brownfield
sites and the Climate Action Plan regarding promotion of active modes. He expressed his
opposition to the scheme stating that the LNDR should be reconsidered, notwithstanding the
concerns expressed by the companies in the National Technology Park, The best plan for
Limerick, in his opinion, was a sustainable transport plan.

Cllr. Ryan (M) disagreed stating as a road haulier, a route which by-passed Limerick city was
badly needed. The Chair believed that the LNDR would support the desire to make Limerick
city a more liveable city.

Mr. Gallagher said that while the LSMATS would aim to reduce car use by increasing public
transport and active modes in the foreseeable future, the car would not be completely got
rid of, and therefore an orbital route which would take non-city-bound journeys away from
the city centre was essential. He stated that the LNDR will be crucial to the success of the
LSMATS.

Cllr. Secas queried whether this meant that the scheme had to be completely re-designed?
Mr. Kennedy responded by saying that the variation to the County Development Plan copper-
fastened the route of the road, and that the appraisal process now underway is to ensure that
this route is still the optimal route.

Cllr. Leddin (8) disagreed with Mr. Gallagher stating that we should not be discussing the
diversion of traffic from the city centre; we should be promoting a modal shift away from the
car. The Limerick Tunnel is the Limerick bypass he argued, and the LNDR proposal would have
a detrimental effect on traffic flows in the tunnel, which Transport Infrastructure Ireland may
have issues with. Cllr. O'Hanlon disagreed stating that residents of South East Co. Clare would
not use the tunnel to bypass the city. Cllr. Butler urged that we speak with the same level of
ambition regarding investment in public transport and active modes as we do regarding
future roads.

Mr. Kennedy concluded by saying that in order for the Council to meet its sustainable
transport targets we needed to provide infrastructure for both cars and other modes. He said
that the LSMATS would identify potential park and ride sites to cater for commuters coming
into the city.

Item 5: To Consider Draft Road Safety Plan
Mr. Slavin did a presentation on the contents of the draft Road Safety Plan. The plan is an
inter-agency approach to ensure the sefety of all road users, reduce road collisions and road

deaths. He stated that it is the responsibility of all road users to ensure their own safety, and
the safety of other road users.

The plan proposes a range of measures under the Four ‘E’s of Road Safety: Enforcement,
Engineering, Education and Evaluation to target further reductions in deaths and injuries on
Irish roads.

In welcoming the presentation, Cllr. O’Donovan suggested that the HSE be invited to
nominate a representative from Trauma Services. She also suggested that the Council
examine the potential for introducing a junior road safety officer scheme.

Clir, Leddin (B) pointed to the near total collapse of young people walking and cycling to
school. He intimated that he would be supportive of the Plan if it contained commitments to
segregate pedestrian and cycle lanes from roadways.

Cllr. Secas asked about education actions contained in the Plan.

In response Mr. Slavin confirmed that he had spoken with the HSE about representation and
would welcome any representation from Headway (as requested by Cllr. O’ Donovan); that the
LSMATS will incorporate a review of the Limerick Cycle Network, and where feasible
segregated cycle lanes will be developed; and that the Road Safety Authority provides
educational road safety training; and the Limerick Fire Service, Garda Siochana, HSE and LCCC
Traffic Unit do annual road collision simulation training. Mr. Kennedy thanked the Members
and invited them to input into the Plan before it is launched in early in 2020.

“1 am calling on Limerick City and County Council to hire an experienced senior Active
Transport Officer in order to support the Council’s work in developing an active transport
strategy that supports cycling and walking as a mode of transport”.

In proposing the notice of motion, Clir. Butler stressed the need for a dedicated active
transport co-ordinator to support the roll out of projects under the LSMATS and other
strategies and schemes. He felt that the coordinator should have an engineering background,
and have experience in the area of transport planning. Cllr Leddin (B) seconded the motion.

In a written response, the Director advised that a transport planner has been employed by
the Council since the outset of the Smarter Travel Programme, and while the position had
been recently vacated, he was hopeful that it would be filled shortly.

Cllr. Butler thanked the Director for his response.

“| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would employ an in-
house chartered transport planner to provide professional input to all Directorates”.

In proposing the notice of motion, Cllr. Leddin (B) stressed the need for a chartered transport
planner to bolster the team and support the delivery of the workload. Cllr Butler seconded
the motion.

In a written response, the Director advised that a transport planner has been employed by
the Council since the outset of the Smarter Travel Programme, and while the position had
been recently vacated, he was hopeful that it would be filled shortly. He added that funding
is available for this position, but that there was not funding for other positions at present.

Cllr. Leddin (B) thanked the Director for his response.

“1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would set an active
travel modal share target of 50% for the Limerick Metropolitan Area as an objective of the
Limerick Shannon Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS)”.

In proposing, the notice of motion on Cllr. Leddin (8) stated that the active modal share in
Limerick recorded in the Census 2016 was very low, and argued that the LSMATS was an
opportunity to set ambitious targets to achieve a greater modal mix.


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
In a written response the Director stated that while the National Transport Authority would
not be setting active modal share targets in the LSMATS, it is expected that in the 2020-2040
time period the walking mode share in Limerick City could reasonably reach 20% - 25%, Public
Transport 15% - 18%, and cycling 10%, giving a total for all three modes approaching 50%.

Cllr. Leddin (B) thanked the Director for his response.

“| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council provide a cycle lane
from Wickham Street to the Park Canal”.

In proposing the notice of motion on behalf of Cllr. Hartigan, Clir. Leddin (B) stressed the need
for a link between the city centre cycle networks and the Park Canal cycle route.

In a written response, the Director stated that the Council will progress this as a scheme with
the National Transport Authority (NTA) for funding in 2020, if confirmed as a cycling route in
the Transport Strategy. The Council recognises that a definite desire line exists for cycle
connectivity along this route.

Cllr. Leddin (8) thanked the Director for his response.

“| will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the
Council investigates the feasibility of developing a cycle path from the Mill Road to the city
centre along the riverbank”.

As Cllr. Sheehan was not in attendance, the Chair deferred this Motion to the next Committee
Meeting.

Item 11. Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. Mc Sweeney (deferred from metro Meeting)

“| call on Limerick City and County Council to engage with the National Transport Authority to
seek improved bus services for Ballybrown / Clarina and Patrickswell area”.

As Cllr. McSweeney was not in attendance, the Chair deferred this Motion to the next
Committee Meeting.

Motion submitted by Cllr. O’ Sullivan (def etl

“| will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the
Council examine the entry to Limerick city from Co Clare and look at installing welcome
signage at the Clondrinagh Roundabout approach on the Ennis Road that is benefitting of
lreland’s third largest city and the commercial, administrative and cultural capital of the Mid
West”.

In proposing the notice of motion, Cllr. O’Sullivan noted that there was a multiplicity of
signage in the City of which some was out of date and others were confusing. She called for


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
a review of signage and the installation of updated “welcome” signage at the entrance points
to the City.

In a written response, the Director advised that a Wayfinding Orientation and Place Making
Strategy, managed by the Tourism Section, has recently gone out to Tender. The receipt of
submissions is mid-January 2020. All aspects of signage in the Metropolitan area including
‘welcome signage’ will form part of this project.

Cllr, O’Sullivan thanked the Director for his response.

Clir. Secas queried whether the Strategy would consider multilingual signage. Mr Kennedy
replied that he was not certain of this, but that he would pass on her query to the Tourism
Section

“1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately revises
current transport infrastructure programmes to be ready to achieve at least 10% expenditure
on facilitating cycling by Q4 2020, as mandated in the Government’s Climate Action Plan”.

in a written response, the Director noted that it was a requirement of Action 97 of the Climate
Action Plan 2019 that DTTAS revise its current transport infrastructure programmes to
achieve at least 10% expenditure on facilitating cycling by Q4 2020. He continued by saying
that the Council will comply with any grant condition from DTTAS pertaining to Action 97 once
they are introduced by the Department.

Clir. B. Leddin acknowledged the reply and indicated that he was happy with the response.

This concluded the business of the Meeting.

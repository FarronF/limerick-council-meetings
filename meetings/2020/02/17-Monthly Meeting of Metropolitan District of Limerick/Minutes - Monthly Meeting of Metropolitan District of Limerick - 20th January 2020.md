**QUESTIONS**

**4.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask the Council if a decision has been made to have cycle lanes painted as part of the Dublin***

***Road improvement scheme.***

**REPLY:**

I refer to the R445 Dublin Road and the overlay scheme that was completed between

the Annacotty and Kilmurray roundabouts in 2019.

I confirm that the cycle lanes cannot be painted onto this road for the following

reasons;

 *The traffic volumes on the R445 Dublin road is 20,000 AADT. It is recommended*

*that cycle lanes are placed if the traffic volumes are less than 8000 AADT*

 *The speed limit on this section of road is 60kmph. It is recommended to place*

*cycle lanes only where the speed limit is 50kmph*

Consulting Engineers have been employed to investigate smarter travel proposals

on the R445 Dublin Road. I will comment further when they conclude their

investigation.

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask the Council what progress, if any, has been made to advance the project on upgrading***

***Lower Golf Links Road near O’Shea’s Pub and why the Part 8 planning application has not yet***

***been lodged to date.***

**REPLY:**

The Part 8 for Golf Links Road involves works on lands, which have been identified---
3

as requiring flood defence measures under CFRAM. The Council has been in

discussions with Office of Public Works regarding the flood study for the bridge and

flood protection measures. The Council is finalising the documents for the Part 8

and it is planned to lodge planning in Q1 2020.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask the Council when the Burial Ground Strategy will be presented to the relevant SPC as***

***that was supposed to happen in late 2019 and whether consideration has been given to either***

***acquire more land at Kilmurry or create another cemetery for Castletroy.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has commenced work on the Burial Ground and

Interment Strategy. There will be a workshop with each Metropolitan/Municipal

Districts in Quarter 1 2020 to discuss the draft strategy prior to it being considered

by the Community, Culture and Leisure SPC. The need for additional burial grounds

for the Metropolitan area will be considered as part of the strategy.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting can Limerick City and County Council consider the placement of***

***stickers stating ‘parked illegally fine issued’ in collaboration with Gardaí to increase awareness***

***of enforcement due to the high level of indiscriminate parking in the city.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council consider that the introduction of such a “sticker”

placement programme is unwarranted for the following reasons :

 Unlikely to have or sustain any significant impact.

 Likely to encourage others to engage in similar practice.

 Would contribute to the creation of unnecessary littering of the city.

 Prohibited under the provisions of the Litter Pollution Acts, 1997 – 2009.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council consider the placement of a***

***semi permanent structure with appropriate facilities to enable musicians and cultural***

***organizations to perform in the People’s Park.***

**REPLY:**

The Council is receiving an increasing number of requests for use of the Peoples

Park for events of this nature. There is a band stand in the Park and also two small

shelters. Having regard to the request, the proposal will be examined further to

determine any power upgrades that may be required and an update will be

provided in the near future.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the Southside Master Plan and what progress has**

**been made since public meetings in 2018.**

**REPLY:**

The Southside Masterplan consists of three stages as follows:---
4

 STAGE A: SURVEY AND ANALYSIS This stage is complete.

 STAGE B: DRAFT PLAN This stage is complete.

 Stage C: Final Plan This stage has commenced, with outstanding tasks to

complete including updating Toppins Field masterplan, landscape updates,

access, streets and utilities update, cost plan updates to inform funding

applications, client review and sign off before draft masterplan can be

workshopped with Councillors and proceed to public display. It is anticipated

that public display will commence in Q1 2020 with final adoption in Q2 2020.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if there is currently a tree planting and wildflower strategy for the***

***Metropolitan area, and if not are there plans to develop one.***

**REPLY:**

At present the Council does not have a tree planting and wildflower strategy. As was

indicated at the recent Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment SPC, the

Council intends to develop a tree strategy which will only deal with trees that the

Council is responsible for. This Strategy will be prepared by the Physical

Development Directorate and should be drafted by the end of 2020, subject to the

resources available in the Directorate.

The Council is currently piloting three wildflower areas in Limerick, and in

accordance with our commitments under the All Ireland Pollinator Plan, intends to

create more pollinator friendly and wildflower planting areas in Limerick.

**Question submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***I ask at the next Meeting whether the introduction of the MyPoint system has resulted in an***

***increase in participation in public consultations, and whether internal capacity exists within***

***Limerick City and County Council to make minor improvements to the system.***

**REPLY:**

MyPoint is a digital alternative to receiving submissions through traditional means,

e.g. hard copy submissions and is not a replacement.  Since launching My Point in

April 2019, 14 consultations and 2 citizen surveys have gone live on the portal.  Part

VIII submissions received in hard copy are now routinely uploaded to MyPoint along---
8

with the digital uploads allowing citizens to view every submission in one location.

Depending on the nature of the consultation, participation can vary. The recent

O’Connell Street Revitalisation Project received 64 submissions from engaged

citizens, 58 of these submissions were made via the online portal. This has reduced

Limerick’s carbon footprint by eliminating the need for paper and the system is

available to our citizens 24 hours a day/7 days a week.

The Business Improvement Department is the primary contact for the

administration of MyPoint and is continually assessing the system for potential

improvements.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan (to be referred to the Climate**

**Action, Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I wish to propose a motion that Limerick City and County Council review its tender process for***

***weed control service contract to eliminate unnecessary herbicide application, reducing the***

***frequency of spraying and reduce the volume of herbicides used.***

Strategic Policy Committee.

**20.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I propose that Limerick City and County Council write to the Minister for Health demanding that***

***immediate emergency funding be made available to provide sufficient bed spaces and staff for***

***the safe and efficient functioning of the hospital.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan stated that University Hospital Limerick is one of the

most financially neglected hospitals in the country with people having to wait two or three days on

trolleys in A & E before getting a bed. Sufficient bed spaces, staff and finances need to be put into

this hospital as a matter of urgency.

This Motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

**21.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council presents at the next relevant SPC meeting***

***detailed information on the potential costs of providing water supplies at burial grounds.***

Councillor Secas, in proposing the Motion, stated that the cost of providing water supplies at burial

grounds was considered at an Environmental Strategic Policy Committee Meeting in 2016 and more

detailed information on costs was to be provided. A Strategy was also to be presented at the end

of 2019 but was not done. She asked that these costs be prepared and submitted to next Climate

Action, Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee Meeting.

This Motion was seconded by Councillor McSweeney and agreed.---
9

**REPLY:**

This Notice of Motion will be considered as part of the Burial Ground Strategy that

is under preparation. This Strategy is examining the investment required in our

Ground Strategy will be discussed at a workshop in each Municipal / Metropolitan

District before being considered by the Community, Culture & Leisure SPC.

**22.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I welcome the belated decision to defer the event to commemorate the Royal Irish Constabulary***

***and the Dublin Metropolitan Police which was scheduled for the 17**th*** ***January, and I call on the***

***Government to cancel the event entirely.***

Councillor Costelloe, in proposing the Motion, welcomed the decision to defer the event to

commemorate the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police which was

scheduled to take place on 17th January and proposed to write to the Government requesting that

the event be cancelled entirely. He welcomed the decision by Mayor Sheahan not to attend this

event.

This motion was seconded by Councillor Benson and agreed.

**23.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the Council***

***instigate a review of the cycling lane on Parnell Street given the problems with illegal parking***

***and the blocking of the cycle lane that occur regularly.***

Councillor Sheehan, in proposing the Motion, expressed concerns that vehicles are parking on the

cycle lanes on Parnell Street and referred to the need to issue penalty points for drivers who park

in the cycle lanes. He also expressed concerns at double parking occurring on Parnell Street and

the need to change driver behaviour in this regard. Members also discussed the Colbert Station

Plaza area, the difficulties experienced by cyclists as the cycle lane is being used as a drop off facility

and also parking for disabled drivers needs to be reviewed. Members discussed the design concept

in relation to Parnell Street, Wickham Street and Davis Street. Members also referred to the

installation of flexi wands in order to deter drivers from parking on the cycle lanes.

Director of Service Operations noted Members comments and confirmed that the design for Parnell

Street was approved through a Part 8 process and a public consultation process was undertaken.

He also stated that the council would utilise all available resources to enforce illegal parking and

would examine the use of flexi wands. Director of Service Operations confirmed that Colbert Plaza

was owned by Iarnrod Eireann and the council, as part of the redevelopment of the area, made

lands available to the railway station. The Director confirmed that there will be a full safety and

design audit done on the Parnell Street area.

Members discussed the retail trade in the City Centre and requested a presentation on the strategy

to address the revitalisation of the city centre.

This Motion was seconded by Councillor Secas and agreed.---

**24.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the Council***

***review the timing/sequence of the traffic lights at the Dublin Road/Park Road junction.***

Councillor Sheehan, in proposing the Notice of Motion, referred to the ongoing issue at these traffic

lights where motorists are constantly breaking the amber light and blocking the yellow box

junction. He suggested a time restriction on delivery trucks and the number of accidents over the

years and emphasised the need for this junction to be reviewed urgently. In seconding the Motion,

Councillor O’Hanlon referred to the need to address this issue and to review the location of the

pedestrian crossing.

**25.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Leddin (to be referred to the Economic**

**Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

***As the National Planning Framework envisages Limerick City to grow by 50% in the coming years,***

***and in order to underpin the principle of compact growth, while protecting the built and natural***

***heritage of the city, Limerick Council would prepare a Tall Buildings Strategy in order to guide***

***medium to high rise development and give confidence to citizens and developers.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning

Strategic Policy Committee.

**26.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Council provide pedestrian crossings on the***

***intersections of O'Connell Street with Cecil Street, Glentworth Street, Hartstonge Street and***

***Barrington Street to the standard set out in the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets.***

Councillor B. Leddin, in proposing the Motion, said that there are no plans at present to continue

the redevelopment to Barrington Street and referred to the need for a provision for pedestrian

crossings at the intersections of O’Connell Street with Cecil Street, Glentworth Street, Hartstonge

Street and Barrington Street. In seconding the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan stated that these are

highly populated residential areas which would benefit hugely from pedestrian crossings.

**REPLY**:

Provision of pedestrian crossings at the locations described will be assessed as part

of the O’Connell Street Revitalisation Project Phase 2. Any proposed works will be

carried out in accordance with the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets

(DMURS).

**27.**

***and it’s Academy continue its work for soccer football in Limerick.***

Councillor O’Dea, in proposing this Motion, said various people have come on board in setting up

this ‘Not for Profit’ company. He referred to the large number of children who took part in trials

last weekend and the importance of continuing this underage activity. Cllr O’Dea requested the---
11

Members to consider allocating a portion of the GMA funds to the Club to cover this interim period.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Butler called on support from the University of Limerick and

agreed in principle to support this Motion.

Councillor Costelloe referred to the recent death of Mr. Johnny Matthews and acknowledged the

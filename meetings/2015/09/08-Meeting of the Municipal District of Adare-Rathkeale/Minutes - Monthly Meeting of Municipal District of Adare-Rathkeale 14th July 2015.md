in the district including Anahid Cross, Banogue, Lees Cross and Kilfinny.

11. Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary

| will ask at the next Meeting for the Executive Director of the Municipal District of
Adare-Rathkeale to provide a full and clear definition of the General Municipal
Allocation for Elected Members of a Local Authority.

REPLY:

S.1. No. 226 of 2014 Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations
2014 sets out a general interpretation.

“general municipal allocation” — means discretionary funding which is made
available to municipal district members for allocation in the draft budgetary
plan;

12. Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary

! will ask the Executive Director of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale at the
next Meeting if the General Municipal Allocation for 2015 in the sum of €275,000 for
this Municipal District has been administered in compliance with the terms and
conditions of the 2014 Local Government Amendment.

REPLY:

According to Circular Fin 05/2014 dated 29 May 2014 the definition of GMA is provided in
regulations, and is the name given to the discretionary funding which is made available to
municipal district members for allocation in the draft budgetary plan. The amount an
authority can provide by way of a GMA is dependent on the total level of income available
to it, and the non-discretionary costs that must be met as a first call on that income,
including at municipal district level.

the overall level of the General Municipal Allocation proposed by the local authority; the
budget strategy discussion with the CPG, the other decisions made on LPT, and the
estimate of the non-discretionary costs of the authority must be taken into account.

NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council install a
pedestrian crossing on Blackabbey Road, Adare and speed ramps at Abbeyview
Estate, Adare.

Following a discussion, the Operations Manager, South and West Division indicated that a
review of speed limits in estates was being examined.

REPLY:

These matters need to be investigated and will require a traffic count, a pedestrian count
and a speed count to determine the warranty for the provision of a pedestrian crossing at
Blackabbey Road and speed ramps at Abbeyview Estate. Our current work programme
does not allow the resources to carry out this investigative work.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

! will move at the next Meeting that safety works be carried out at McDonaghs
Cross, Kilcornan.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Neville indicated that this was a dangerous cross and
that the installation of mirrors could be used. The Motion was seconded by Councillor

Sheahan.

The Operations Manager, South and West Division indicated that ‘STOP’ signs were the
preferred option for local roads as mirrors could be damaged, however, he indicated that
he would discuss the issue with the Roads Section.

REPLY:

An existing dwelling house severely restricts the visibility at this crossroads junction.
Accordingly, setback of property boundaries is not an option. However the safety of the
junction may be improved by introducing a mandatory STOP on 3 of the approaches,
allowing right of way only for traffic travelling from the South towards the N69 (Killeen

Guesthouse Junction). There is a Statutory process involved in the introduction of this
type of signage and we will commence the process shortly.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

| will move at the next Meeting that speed ramps be erected on the access road to
Askeaton soccer grounds as there is already street lighting to facilitate this.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Neville indicated that Askeaton soccer grounds are
used for sporting events which attract extra traffic from outside the area and that speed
ramps should be erected for public safety.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan who added that ramps should be of
tarmac rather than rubber and Cllr. McMahon added her support to the Motion.

REPLY:

This matter needs to be investigated and will require a traffic count and a speed count to
determine the warranty for ramp provision. Our current work programme does not allow
the resources to carry out this investigative work.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

| will move at the next Meeting that Marine Cove Estate, Foynes be taken in charge.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O'Brien indicated that there was no public lighting on
the approach into Marine Cove Estate, Foynes and highlighted the challenges being faced
by residents living in unfinished estates. The Motion was seconded by Councillor
McMahon and Councillor Neville also supported the Motion. Members highlighted the
need for other estates in the District to be taken in charge including Doonbeirne Estate and
Loughill.

Councillor O'Brien proposed that funding be provided for street lighting for estates not yet
taken in charge by the Council. This was seconded by Councillor Neville.

REPLY:

This estate has not yet been completed to a satisfactory standard for taking in charge.
The Council has claimed the bond lodged for this estate but it will not be sufficient to pay
for the outstanding works. It is therefore intended to make an application under the
Development Fund Allocation for Unfinished Estates in 2016 in order to secure the
balance of funding.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

! will move at the next Meeting that the two thatched dwelling houses which were
recently destroyed by fire in Adare Village be temporarily removed from the list of
Protected Structures to allow their full reinstatement at the earliest possible date
but in doing so permit the use of modern materials, with the appropriate fire ratings,
to satisfy current fire insurance requirements at a reasonable cost to the owners.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Keary proposed that new technology be considered for
the re-construction of the thatched cottages even if this resulted in their temporary removal
from the list of Protected Structures. The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

Councillor Sheahan requested that Councillor Keary consider the withdrawal of his Notice
of Motion and noted that grant funds could be lost if the properties were not on the list of
protected structures.

Department were working with the owners and that modern technology could be
considered in the restoration of the buildings.

During the course of their discussion Councillor O'Donoghue indicated that there was
inadequate funding allocated to roads and it was agreed that this Notice of Motion should

20. Co nden
The following items were raised by Members at the completion of the Agenda.

Councillor Sheahan requested that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport be
written to calling on him to look at the privatisation of more bus routes. He indicated that
the opening of certain bus routes to private competition had facilitated customers to travel
from Limerick to Dublin at a cost of €10.00. Customers using the Bus Eireann service to
travel 31 km from Limerick to Rathkeale pay €10.10 and this route should be opened up to
private competition to facilitate a reduction in fares.

Councillor Neville indicated that there was no bus service from Limerick to Ballingarry and
requested that this service be reintroduced.

Members sought an up-date on the works required to relieve flooding at Castlematrix. The
Operations Manager indicated that he intended to carry out the works after the Road
Works Programme was completed.

Members sought an update on lands acquired, from Coillte, at Grand Gates,
Curraghchase to facilitate road improvements works. The Operations Manager, South and
West Division indicated he would revert back to Members in relation to same.

Councillor O'Donoghue indicated that there was a raised man-hole cover at the entrance
to Ballingarry and sinking of the road near Ballingarry Church.

Councillor O'Donoghue highlighted the increase of rates for some rate payers in the
county and indicated that the formula being used was based on Dublin businesses. He
suggested that training in this area be provided for Members as they were receiving a lot
of representations from constituents in relation to rates and the Commissioner of Valuation
should explain how rates were calculated.

The Head of Finance indicated that the Valuation Office was independent and rates were
based on the letting value of the property and that the occupier/owner could appeal the
rateable valuation to the Valuation Office.

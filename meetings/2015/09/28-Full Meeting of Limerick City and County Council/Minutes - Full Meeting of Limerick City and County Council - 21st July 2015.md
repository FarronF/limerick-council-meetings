1916/2016 Commemoration Programme

The City and County Librarian, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation,

Commemoration Programme which had events planned under the seven strands of

State Ceremonial, Historical Reflection, An Teanga Beo, Youth and Imagination,

Cultural Expression, Community Participation and Global and Diaspora. Other events

to be managed by the Library Service, Limerick Museum and Archives and the Arts

Service were also presented.

Members commended all who had been involved in drawing up the

Commemoration Programme and the following points were made by Members in

relation to same:

• That the commemoration should not be politicised and should acknowledge the

Irish on both sides of the conflict.

• That Kathleen Clarke (nee Daly), Cumann na mBan, Óglaigh na hÉireann, Con

Colbert, Conor O’Brien and Mary Spring Rice be acknowledged as part of the

commemoration.

In response to issues raised by Members, the City and County Librarian

clarified the following:

• With regard to suggestions that the Tunnel under the River Shannon be named

in memory of Kathleen Clarke (nee Daly) and Cumann na mBan, the Tunnel

was not owned by the Council.

• A copy of the Proclamation, to be sent to all schools, would be in both English

and Irish language.

• The allocated budget of €100,000 should be sufficient as there were no high

costs associated with any of the planned events and people in various sectors

were anxious to be involved.

Economic Development and Planning

Proposed Variation No. 4 to Limerick County Development Plan 2010-

2016 to incorporate the preferred route corridor for the Limerick

Northern Distributor Road (LNDR**)**

Circulated, report of the Director, Economic Development and Planning, dated

19th June, 2015, enclosing Chief Executive’s Report to Members dated 19th June,

2015, in relation to Proposed Variation No. 4 to the Limerick County Development

Plan 2010-2016. The Proposed Variation comprised of the incorporation of the

preferred route corridor for the Limerick Northern Distributor Road (LNDR) into the

County Development Plan.

In discussing the proposed variation, Members raised concerns that the

docking point for the preferred route was too close to the M7 motorway. Members

also highlighted the concerns of residents and issues with regard to the process used

to arrive at a preferred route.

The Chief Executive informed Members that while this was critically important

infrastructure and decisions in relation to same should not be rushed into, the

Proposed Variation No. 4 to the Limerick County Development Plan 2010-2016

formed part of a statutory process and a decision in relation to same had to be made

by 31st July, 2015. He assured Members that they would receive all necessary

assistance to facilitate the process.

The A/Director, Travel and Transportation, informed Members that the route

selection process had been carried out in accordance with national guidelines. He

outlined the various stages of the process to date which had commenced in October

2010 and had involved considerable consultation with Members and the public. He

stressed that he would be available over the coming days to discuss any issues of

concern to Members.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (M), seconded by Councillor Clifford, it

was agreed that this item would be deferred to allow time for it to be examined in

greater detail. It was also agreed that the Meetings Administrator would arrange a

date for a Special Meeting of the Council to discuss this item.

Councillor Keary informed the Meeting that a Special Meeting may also be

required in relation to a sale of land at Rathkeale to allow the purchaser to meet a

deadline to avail of funding.

Council

(i)

Circulated, Annual Financial Statement for year ended 31st December, 2014,

together with report from the Head of Finance dated 6th July, 2015.
---
8

The Head of Finance reviewed the Annual Financial Statement for the financial

year ended 31st December, 2014, which was prepared in accordance with the

statutory requirements governing the accounts of Local Authorities and in compliance

with the Accounting Code of Practice for Local Authorities. He noted that this was the

first merged set of accounts for the new Local Authority which showed total revenue

expenditure of €171m, which included a transfer to reserves of €8.3m, and capital

expenditure of €61m.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Collins (J);

And Resolved:

“That, the Annual Financial Statement for year ended 31st December, 2014, for

Limerick City and County Council, be and is hereby adopted.”

Arising from queries raised by Members, the Head of Finance clarified the following:

• Bad debt provision was reviewed on an annual basis in the context of what was

collectable. A prudent approach was adopted but every effort was made to

collect outstanding debts.

• Expenditure over income at Grove Island related to loan repayments. A

management firm was in place to operate the facility which was now expected

to break even.

• The variation in contributions to other Local Authorities, which showed a

decrease in both income and expenditure, arose as transfers which previously

occurred between Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council no longer

took place. These transfers had related primarily to Fire and Waste

Management.

• In relation to City of Culture transactions, €1.1m of an additional €1.5m in

funding had been received by year-end and a debtor of €400,000 was reflected

in the accounts in relation to the outstanding amount.

• The Annual Financial Statement reflected the accounts from January 2014 to

the end of December 2014.

(ii)

Circulated, report from the Head of Finance dated 6th July, 2015 setting out

details of additional expenditure incurred in excess of that provided for in the

Annual Budget for the year ended 31st December, 2014, including capital

transfers.

It was noted that the additional expenditure was in the main met from a

contribution of other income sources, such as increased grant funding, NPPR and

savings / efficiencies across the various services. The authorisation of the Council to

the incurring of the additional expenditure of €16,529,637 was sought.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Collins (J);

And Resolved:
---

“That, authorisation is hereby given, in accordance with Section 104(2) of the

Local Government Act, 2001 (as amended), to the additional expenditure of

€16,529,637 incurred in excess of that provided for in the annual budget for the year

ended 31st December, 2014, including transfers to reserves, as set out in the report

from the Head of Finance dated 6th July, 2015.”

(b)

Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2015

Circulated, report of the Head of Finance dated 9th July, 2015, together with

Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2015.

The report set out the terms and conditions attached to the proposed Tourism

Sector Support Scheme 2015 which was the first of its kind in the Limerick area and

was intended as a financial support to tourist related occupiers of commercial

properties with a total annual commercial rate demand in 2015 greater than €10,000.

It was noted that 92 businesses were eligible for the scheme and the financial support

payable per successful application was 4.5% of the total amount due, subject to terms

and conditions.

Members welcomed the scheme as an important support for the tourism sector

and discussed the importance of working with Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and

Shannon Airport to build the Limerick tourism brand and encourage a greater number

of overnight stays by tourists in Limerick. Members also discussed the potential of

establishing a tourism board in Limerick, the need for a tourism officer in the Council

and the need for a marketing strategy to be developed in association with upcoming

events in Limerick such as the World Title Fight in Thomond Park and the World 7’s

Rugby Tournament. The issue of the tourism sector maintaining standard pricing

during these events was also raised by Members.

The Director, Economic Development and Planning, indicated that the

appointment of a tourism officer was under consideration. He undertook to connect

with Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to discuss the issues raised by Members and

to revert to Members subsequent to these discussions.

The Chief Executive noted that the Council was fully behind the major events

that had been discussed by Members and would support same within existing

resources or, if necessary, revert to Members should additional resources be required.

Proposed by Councillor Collins (J);

Seconded by Councillor Byrne;

And Resolved:

“That, the Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2015, as circulated, be and is

hereby adopted, in accordance with Section 66 (2) of the Local Government Act, 2001

facilitate the provision of a possible secondary school in the future.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next meeting if a Section 183 decision can be revoked and, if so,***

***what the procedure is.***

**REPLY**:

Legal advice was sought in relation to this Question and I set out details

of the advice received hereunder for your attention:
---
13

**“*To deal with this Question, one has to consider Section 183 of the***

***Local Government Act, 2001, and also paragraph 56 of the Standing***

***Orders of Limerick City & County Council which, collectively,***

***provide as follows:-***

***1) Section 183 deals with the requirements for the proposed***

***disposal of land held by a Local Authority and notes that a***

***disposal for a term of years not exceeding one year does not***

***come under the provisions of this section.***

***2) Section 183 further sets out certain procedural matters***

***connected with the disposal of property, including the giving***

***notice to the Members. The purpose of this notice is to provide***

***the Members with certain information including, inter alia:-***

***(I) The property being disposed.***

***(II) The person from whom the property was acquired.***

***(III) The person to whom the property is to be disposed.***

***(IV) Any covenants or conditions that are to attach to the***

***disposal.***

***(V) The purchase price.***

***3) The Members, having been supplied with the above information,***

***have the opportunity of considering the matter and making a***

***decision as to whether they agree or disagree with the disposal.***

***Naturally, it is open to the Members to raise any issues in***

***respect of which they may need clarification at that meeting and***

***before a decision is reached. The Members then decide whether***

***to pass the resolution to dispose of the property, or to decide***

***that the disposal shall not be carried out.***

***4) Turning now specifically to paragraph 56 of the Standing***

***Orders, it is important to note that this is worded in such a***

***manner as to afford an opportunity to the Members in certain***

***circumstances to rescind a resolution. If the rescission is to***

***take place within six months of the resolution being passed, the***

***Councillors have to carry out the procedures that are set out in***

***paragraph 56. Notice has to be given of the intention of the***

***Members to rescind a resolution passed within the previous six***

***months and that notice has to have the name of the Member***

***who proposes the Motion, together with the names of five other***

***Members who are supporting the Motion to rescind.***

***It is important to bear in mind that Standing Orders cannot overrule***

***the existing common law or statutory law. Standing Orders are***

***brought in for the purpose of regulating meetings. There is no***

***doubt that the Council, in the Standing Orders which it has***

***adopted, has given itself a general power to revoke a resolution.***

***However, I must reiterate that such a revocation must not result in***

***any breach of statutory law or common law.***
---
14

***Further, where the Council is exercising a quasi-judicial power,***

***such as revoking a Section 183 Resolution, this cannot, in my view,***

***be done where there is a binding contract in place. The Members***

***will be acquainted with the number of resolutions that come before***

***it for the disposal of dwellinghouses and other properties. The***

***contracts in respect of those properties typically contain a***

***provision that the contract is subject to the passing of a resolution***

***under Section 183 of the 2001 Act.***

***When that resolution is passed, the sale of the property is then***

***completed. There is no question of waiting to see if the resolution***

***is going to be rescinded under the provisions of the Standing***

***Orders. If a binding contract exists, as it would where there is a***

***disposal of houses or other property, then once the resolution is***

***passed, that binding contract becomes enforceable. In those***

***circumstances, it would be very wrong for the Members to rescind***

***a resolution when the purchaser of the property has been advised***

***of the passing of the resolution and a contract exists.***

***One must also be very much aware of the fact that the Councillors***

***have an opportunity, when considering a Section 183 resolution, of***

***either approving of the disposal or rejecting the disposal. That is***

***very significant, because it could be very strongly argued that the***

***Councillors had an opportunity of rejecting the resolution at that***

***particular time. Once that resolution was passed, then the***

***likelihood is that a binding legal contract comes into existence. If***

***that is so, in my view, the resolution under Section 183 of the Local***

***Government Act, 2001, could not be revoked or rescinded on foot***

***of the Standing Orders.***

***Of course, the question may be asked as to why the Members seem***

***to have a revocation power at paragraph 56 of the Standing Orders***

***but are now being advised by me that this cannot apply to***

***decisions made with regards the transfer of property where there is***

***a binding contract. The answer to this is quite simply that, in my***

***view, the power the Councillors have given themselves to revoke is***

***not absolute and must be conditional on the decision not affecting***

***a third party who has acquired a contractual interest.***

***This would differ, for example, where the Members wish to revoke a***

***resolution passed with regards to an item fully within the control of***

***the Local Authority – traffic control, signage etc. In such an***

***instance, it is of course open to the Council to revisit the decision.***

***However, where a third party has, on foot of the passing of a***

***resolution, acquired a contractual interest, I believe that the***

***Councillors do not have the same leeway to revoke. I trust the***

***above clarifies the position.”***

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next meeting, following the signing of the lease with Cadence***

***Enviropower Limited for a gasification plant at Gortadroma, will the planning***

***process be a direct application to Limerick City and County Council, a direct***

***application to An Bord Pleanála or a Part V111 application by the Council.***

**REPLY**:

This application will be considered in accordance with the relevant

legislation in relation to Strategic Infrastructure Development.

It is a mandatory requirement for a prospective applicant for planning

permission for development listed in the 7th Schedule (see below) to

enter into pre-application consultations with the Board and obtain notice

from the Board stating whether or not the proposed development is

regarded as strategic infrastructure development.

For the purposes of these consultations, the prospective applicant must

supply sufficient information to the Board to enable it to assess the

proposed development in the light of the criteria set out for strategic

infrastructure development.

**Definition of Strategic Infrastructure Development**

The 7th Schedule to the 2000 Act lists the classes of infrastructure

development which, if considered by the Board to be strategic

infrastructure development, require direct application for permission to

the Board instead of the local Planning Authority.

To qualify as strategic infrastructure development, a proposed

development must first come within the scope of one or more of the

classes and comply with the thresholds contained in the 7th Schedule.

In addition, the Board must come to the opinion that the proposed

development, if carried out, would fall within one or more of the

following:-

• is of strategic economic or social importance to the State or the

region in which it would be situate,

•

would contribute substantially to the fulfilment of any of the objectives

of the National Spatial Strategy or any regional planning guidelines in

respect of the area or areas in which the development would be

situate,

• would have a significant effect on the area of more than one planning

authority.

The opinion is formed by the Board at the conclusion of the pre-

application stage.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

17

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan noted that a dividend of €350,000

was expected in respect of 2015 and this income could be timely in light of the 2016

commemoration events or be of general benefit.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).

**REPLY:**

IPB does not issue a bonus. A dividend is paid by the organisation to its

members which is calculated proportionate to premiums paid. Although

not guaranteed, the Council has provided an income budget in its book

for 2015 for receipt of an annual dividend. The income is part of the

overall income which the Council needs in order to achieve a balanced

outturn at year-end.

To ensure that the Council has a balanced revenue and capital account,

it is not possible at this time to redistribute any funding.

Councillor Scanlan indicated that he was unhappy with the response and the

Head of Finance stressed that this income was part of total income to provide services

and the outturn would have to be balanced at the end of the twelve months.

**Correspondence**

The Correspondence circulated with the Agenda was taken as read.

Councillor Donegan referred to the letter in the Correspondence dated 10th

Government in response to a resolution of the Council requesting the Minister to

establish an external independent investigation into the actions of Limerick County

Council in relation to its handling of Planning Application Ref. Nos. 06/3641 and

08/1288. He stated that a new Ombudsman had now reported on this case and he

proposed that the Chief Executive arrange for an independent external review of the

matter. The proposal was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue.

The Chief Executive noted that he did not have a copy of a further Ombudsman

report referred to and that any external investigation set up by him would not be seen

as independent. He requested that Councillor Donegan provide him with a copy of the

Ombudsman’s report under discussion and undertook to review same and revert to

Councillor Donegan on the matter of an internal review of the case.

• Additional Grant Funding for Roads

At the conclusion of the agenda and with the permission of the Mayor, the

Meetings Administrator informed the Members that Limerick City and County Council

was notified on Friday, 17th July, that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport

(DTTAS) had allocated an additional €1,008,750 in grant funding under the category

of Road Restoration Improvement. This grant was part of an additional €24,000,000

in funding being made available nationally this year for road improvements.
---

It was intended that the additional funding would be used to carry out additional

road improvement throughout the City and County with schemes being picked from

the Multi-Annual Road Works Plan. Funding would be allocated across the Districts

approximately as per the Grant allocations earlier in the year.

€1,000,000 would deliver approx. between eight to nine kilometres of road

restoration schemes based on an average rural road width of six metres.

The Meetings Administrator noted that this additional grant allocation for road

improvement was being received at a time when grant funding had been limited, and

that a list of the schemes to be funded would be circulated to all Councillors over the

next week. He also undertook to circulate the correspondence that had been received

from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to same, together

with a report from the A/Director, Travel and Transportation, dated 21st July, 2015.

Members welcomed the allocation of additional funding to the Council.

1.Economic Development & Planning

Proposed Variation No. 4 to the Limerick County Development

Plan 2010-2016 to incorporate the preferred route corridor for the

Limerick Northern Distributor Road (LNDR)

It was noted that this item had been deferred from the July Meeting held on 21st

July, 2015, to allow time for it to be examined in greater detail.

Already circulated, report dated 19th June 2015 from the Director of Economic

Development and Planning enclosing a copy of the Chief Executive’s Report on

the Proposed Variation No. 4 to the Limerick County Development Plan 2010-

2016, dated 19th June 2015, which was prepared in accordance with Section

13(4)(a) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended;

A further report entitled ‘Limerick Northern Distributor Road – Summary of

Scheme Development,’ dated 23rd July, 2015, had also been circulated following

the issue of the agenda.

The A/Director, Travel & Transportation, informed the Members that the proposed

variation of the Limerick County Development Plan was intended to protect the

route corridor for the proposed Northern Distributor Road. He noted that the

Council, in conjunction with Clare County Council and Roughan & O’Donovan,

Consulting Engineers, had worked since 2010 to identify the preferred route for

the Northern Distributor Road, which was a critical piece of infrastructure without

which the City would not grow to its full potential.

Mr. Michael Conroy from Roughan & O’Donovan, Consulting Engineers, gave a

presentation to Members on the process that had been undertaken to date and

the options considered in selecting the preferred route. He stressed the

importance of being in a position to stand over the thoroughness of the selection

process when the proposals were brought to An Bord Pleanála for approval.

Mr. Tony Cawley from Hydro Environmental Ltd. informed Members that he had

carried out flood risk assessment for the preferred route. The route had been

assessed in terms of regular and extreme flooding and, in this regard, the floods

in 2009, the worst since 1916, had acted as a good baseline. He pointed out that

the road should have no strategic influence on the flood plain and would not

worsen the flooding effect. He stressed that the preferred route had passed the

justification test set out in the Flood Risk Management Guidelines and noted that

the Office of Public Works, in its submission, had agreed with this point.

Varying views were expressed by Members, both in favour of the proposed route

for the Northern Relief Road and against, and in response to issues raised by

Members, Mr. Conroy clarified the following:-
---
**3**

• The need for the Northern Relief Road had been identified in the Spatial

Strategy, the Mid-West Area Strategic Plan and the Limerick and Clare

County Development Plans.

• It was accepted that roads elsewhere also needed to be built but it was

intended to have the appropriate plans in place for the Northern Relief

Road when funding became available.

• Cost benefit analysis in relation to the impact of the proposed Northern

Relief Road on the Tunnel had been carried out and taken into

consideration. Emissions analysis was also included in the cost benefit

analysis.

• A Killaloe By-Pass would not solve traffic issues at the University of

Limerick or the National Technology Park, Plassey.

• A single access road to the north campus of the University of Limerick

would not solve issues for other road users on that side of the City.

• The National Parks & Wildlife Service had been met with on several

occasions during the route selection process and could object to An Bord

Pleanála if it had issues with the preferred route.

• A docking point at Vistakon would bring in excess of 30,000 extra vehicles

per day to that location, with consequences for traffic flow.

• The road design would not impact on flooding and displacement would be

imperceptible. No changes were anticipated in the final CFRAM mapping

due in 2016.

• Devastation issues, climate change and no flow at Ardnacrusha had been

factored into the analysis and the route selection process would stand up

to scrutiny.

• The Habitats Directive proved challenging for many of the route section

options. There was an obligation to protect the environment and the

scheme would fail if this was not adhered to.

• An Environmental Impact Assessment would be carried out at design

stage so that all impacts could be assessed.

• It would be unprecedented to seek approval from An Bord Pleanála for

roads projects where the route was not protected in the relevant Local

Authority’s Development Plan. It was anticipated that the Department of

Transport, Tourism & Sport and the National Roads Authority would be

reluctant to fund any road project under such circumstances.

**4**

• A crossing of the headrace associated with the Ardnacrusha power plant,

which had been considered as part of a wider study area, had been

discounted on advice from the ESB regarding the catastrophic flood risk

should the embankment be damaged. The ESB had a statutory

responsibility to protect its scheme.

• A docking point at the Mackey Roundabout would bring traffic too far from

the City and would exacerbate traffic issues at that location which the

preferred route was seeking to resolve.

• The proposed distributor road would have two lanes each way, with

provision for bicycles and pedestrians, and would dovetail with any local

plans. A motorway in its place would have limited access and allow for

limited development adjacent to it, which would be contrary to the

objectives of the distributor road.

The A/Director, Travel & Transportation, stressed the need to protect the

identified route and informed the Members that, should the scheme be approved

by An Bord Pleanála, it would join other schemes awaiting Government approval,

based on policy and economics at the time. He clarified that it would take twelve

months to consider any new route but a logical join with a route on the Co. Clare

side would have to be taken into consideration along with the fact that An Bord

Pleanála would consider any new route in comparison to the existing preferred

route which had the least impact under all criteria.

On the proposal of the Deputy Mayor and seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), it

was agreed to adjourn the Meeting for fifteen minutes.

On resumption of the Meeting, a vote was taken on the proposed Variation No. 4

to the Limerick County Development Plan, with the following result:-

**In Favour**

Councillors Daly, Gilligan, Leddin. (3)

**Against**

Councillors Browne, Butler, Collins (J), Crowley, Donegan, Foley, Gleeson,

Hurley, Keary, Keller, Loftus, Lynch, McCreesh, Mitchell, Neville, Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh, O’Dea, O’Donoghue, Prendiville, Ryan, Secas, Sheahan (J), Sheahan

(K), Sheahan (M), Sheehy, Teefy. (26)

There were no abstentions.

The Deputy Mayor declared the proposed Variation rejected.

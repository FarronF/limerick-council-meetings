Environment and Water Services

It was noted that this item had been deferred from the Special Meeting held on

29th July, 2015.

Already circulated, report of the A/Director, Environment and Water Services,

dated 24th July, 2015, regarding the Eastern and Midlands Region – Proposed Water

Supply Project - Options Working Paper.

The Director of Environment and Water Services pointed out that the

documentation circulated set out four options for the supply of water to an area

stretching from the east of the Shannon to Dublin and that Irish Water was seeking

input with regard to the range of constraints and assessment criteria that should be

applied to the process of selecting a preferred option.

In noting the contents of the report, the following points and queries were raised

by Members during discussion:

• The proposals supported development in Dublin and the east of the country rather

than the west of the country, which was underdeveloped.

• Desalination was the most acceptable option as it would have no effect on the River

Shannon and would not require the laying of a connection across the country.

• The high leakage rate in the Dublin pipe network should be addressed before any

consideration was given to pumping water from the Shannon to Dublin.

• There should be a greater emphasis on water harvesting and the reduction of

usage.

• Fixing of leaks alone would not be enough to cater for future usage in the Dublin

area and there should be a willingness to share water resources with Dublin.

• The proposed reservoir in the midlands would be positive for tourism and amenity in

that area.

• Proposals to extract from the River Shannon would have a positive impact on those

farming in the Shannon Callows.

• Irish Water must ensure that it focused on the needs of all cities in the State.

• Consultation on these proposals could be improved as not all people who would be

affected by these proposals were aware of same.

• A high level of lead was discharged from local mining into the Parteen Basin, which

should be taken into consideration in relation to that option.---

• What effect would the abstraction of water from the Shannon have on:

− Water levels;

− The Ardnacrusha Power Plant;

− Amenity of the Shannon, including boating;

− Fish life / fishing;

− Ecology of the river;

− Flooding;

− The people and the economic development of the Limerick Region.

• What was the projected cost and timescale for the various options.

• What was the cost comparison between the Shannon abstraction options and the

fixing of leaks in Dublin.

• Several reports over the last number of years had clarified the majority of the issues

raised and these reports should be circulated to Members.

The Director, Environment and Water Services, noted the issues raised by

Members and undertook to bring same to the attention of Irish Water.

The Mayor noted that Irish Water had not been due to attend to discuss this

item. He requested the Executive to circulate any reports relevant to this item to

Members and arrange for a Special Meeting to be held in September 2015, with Irish

Water to attend to discuss this item only.

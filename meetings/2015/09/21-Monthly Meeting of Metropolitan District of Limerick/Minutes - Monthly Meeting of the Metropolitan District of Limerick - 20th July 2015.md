Meeting. Mr. Hargaden presented an overview of Respond’s activities that included the

following:

 Details of facilities at Ballygrennan Close, Distillery View and Summer Court.

 Homeless services offered in Suaimhneas and plans for additional homeless

services.

 The National Housing Strategy and the challenges faced by Approved Housing

Bodies (AHBs) on the delivery of robust social housing.

 Principles adhered to in relation to Property and Asset Management, Estate

Management and Corporate Governance.

 Details in relation to Community Development / Education and Special Projects.

Members thanked Mr. Hargaden for his presentation and praised the good work being

carried out by Respond in Limerick and noted that much of the funding directed at

Approved Housing Bodies would previously have been allocated to Local Authorities for

the construction of social housing.

In response to issues raised by Members, Mr. Hargaden clarified the following:

 Respond had an out of hours contact service. Any Members having difficulty

contacting Respond staff locally should bring the matter to his attention.

 All lettings in the area were agreed with Limerick City and County Council and this

practice would continue.

 Older single tenants were catered for and accommodation, targeted at this group,

was in place.

 Respond was generally prevented from selling its stock to tenants but some scope

could exist where the mortgage on a property was cleared. This issue was under

review.

 Difficulties had been experienced letting voids in Ballygrennan. This position had

now changed, an application for funding had been made to the Department and it

was hoped that this matter would be resolved within months.---

Community, Leisure and Emergency Services

Circulated Report of the Director, Limerick 2020 dated 14th July, 2015 with

accompanying report entitled “69 O'Connell Street Developing our Arts and Cultural

Resources” dated July 2015. The Director, Limerick 2020 outlined details of the report

to Members including proposals to develop 69 O’Connell Street as an arts and culture

venue along with details of proposed structures and approaches to marketing,

promotion, management and governance.

Members welcomed the proposals and stressed the need for 69 O’Connell Street to be

used for performances and not just practice. Members also noted the financial

commitment already made to 69 O’Connell Street and requested to be kept appraised of

ongoing commitments and progress at his location.

In response to issues raised by Members, the Director, Limerick 2020 clarified the

following:

 With regard to previous management structures, the rejuvenation of this venue was a

complex process but the Council had taken on this responsibility and needed to

move the process on.

 The venue would be available as an arts centre and also for start ups. Use as a

digital hub would be actively pursued.

 The decision to locate events in the Lime Tree Theatre or 69 O’Connell Street would

be based on predicted audience numbers.

 The potential of aligning with activities carried out at The Royal would be reviewed.

 While an in-depth review of operations was planned after three years, an internal

review would be carried out on an ongoing basis.

 While the Lime Tree Theatre would be responsible for the operational management

of 69 O’Connell Street, the Board will be responsible for programming activity.

The Deputy Chief Executive, in response to an enquiry from Members, clarified that

there were still outstanding legal issues in relation to 69 O’Connell Street. He

acknowledged the role played by the Lime Tree Theatre in assisting in the current

process and pointed out that details of the service level agreement between Lime Tree

Theatre and Limerick City and County Council would be brought to the Metropolitan

District in advance of the item being brought to full Council.

On the proposal of Councillor Clifford and seconded by Councillor Byrne it was agreed

that the Council should proceed as indicated in the Report of the Director, Limerick 2020

dated 14th July, 2015.

2015 enclosing a copy of the draft Socio-Economic Statement and High Level Goals for

the Limerick Local Economic and Community Plan, inviting written submissions in

relation to same and setting out the remaining stages for the preparation of the Plan.

Members noted the contents of the report and the following points were raised by

Members:---

 Should the water / wastewater infrastructure prove inadequate to service the

objectives of the Plan, any required infrastructure improvements will be under the

control of Irish Water and not the Council.

 Members should be provided with details of submissions made by Irish Water and

the NRA to enable Members to judge how the plans of these bodies co-ordinate with

those of the Council.

 No submissions had been received from the community / voluntary sector which had

400 groups affiliated under the Public Participation Network (PPN).

The Administrative Officer, Community, Leisure and Emergency Services and the

Executive Planner clarified the following:

 Details of submissions received would be circulated to Members.

 No budget had been allocated as yet to the Plan, it was the intention to first prioritise

objectives and then seek funding for same.

 The Plan covers the entire Council but each District will be consulted three times

during the course of its development.

 The PPN was not properly in place to respond to initial consultations but should be in

place for the second phase.

 The Plan is statutory and actions will be timeframed.

4.

Circulated, Report of the Director, Economic Development and Planning dated 1st July,

2015.

Members welcomed the taking in charge of the estates as outlined in the report and

looked forward to the completion of the works required to facilitate access from Glendale

onto the Old Singland Road. Members also highlighted the need for improvement works

to be carried out to the Bloodmill Road and the Acting Director, Travel and

Transportation informed Members that funding was being sought in relation to same.

Proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Sheahan, and resolved:

“That the following housing estates be taken in charge in accordance with Section 180 of

6.

Travel and Transportation

**Part 8 Procedure** **–** **Mungret Environs Roadworks**

Circulated, Report of the Acting Director, Travel and Transportation dated 8th July, 2015

along with Chief Executive’s Report dated 3rd July, 2015 which was prepared pursuant to

Section 179 (3)(a) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000–2014 and Part VIII of the

Planning and Development Regulations 2001–2013 in respect of proposed Mungret

Environs Roadworks. It was proposed to proceed in accordance with the Chief

Executive’s Report.

On the proposal of Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Leddin, it was agreed

that Standing Orders be suspended for 30 minutes to facilitate the completion of the

agenda.

Members welcomed the proposed works and raised their concerns with regard to traffic

volumes in the area, both existing and predicted, and highlighted the role Limerick

Smarter Travel and Bus Eireann could play in managing same.

In response to issues raised by Members, the Senior Executive Engineer, Travel and

Transportation clarified the following:

 Planning permission for the proposed schools in Mungret was dependent on works

proposed in the Part VIII before the Members.

 In relation to Member’s concerns with regard to increased traffic levels in the area,

traffic levels would be those associated with an urban area and while there may be

issues at peak times, the consultants engaged to design the proposed works had

indicated that the design had the capacity to deal with anticipated traffic.

 There were no proposals in place to build a publicly funded link road between

Patrickswell and Mungret. It was anticipated that such a road would be put in place

through private development as housing development expands in that area.

 Bus lanes were not provided as part of the proposed works. Buses would share the

road with other vehicles with a 50kph speed limit in place but significant set down

areas would be provided.

 In relation to a traffic management plan for the Raheen Dooradoyle area, Limerick

Smarter Travel was developing a pedestrian / cycle plan for same.

 The staggered opening times of schools would be taken on board in relation to new

schools.

 Funding for the proposed works was not yet in place but the Council was in

communication with the Department and the NRA in relation to same.

 The issue of a suggested 80kph speed limit on the N69 from the Dock Road to

Clarina was under review by the NRA.---
6

 Lines of communication with everyone affected by the proposed works would remain

open.

8.

Pilot Urban Garden Project

**To receive Presentation on the Pilot Urban Garden Project at O'Connell Street /**

**Cruises Street.**

It was agreed that this Item be deferred to the next meeting.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor James Collins

***I will ask at the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council will provide***

***speed ramps in the Chill Chaoide housing estate in Clarina as soon as possible in***

***the interests of public safety?***

**REPLY:**

The Council will undertake a traffic study in this area to ascertain traffic

speeds in order to assess the need for the provision of speed ramps in the

Chill Chaoide Housing Estate, Clarina.

It should be noted that a list of agreed estates are currently being provided

with traffic calming from the 2015 Budget. A programme for 2016 will be

prepared later this year and this will be progressed in 2016 subject to

funding. It should also be noted that the Council intends to introduce

30kph speed limits to Housing Estates throughout the City and County in

2016 with the 30kph Speed Limit being introduced to 30 estates in 2015.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor James Collins

***I will ask at the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council will provide***

***financial assistance to the Boherbuoy Band to aid with the repair of their band***

***hall?***

**REPLY**:

While there is no provision in the Community budget for 2015 to offer

financial assistance to requests of this nature, the Community Section

would be willing to meet with representatives of the Boherbuoy Band with a

view to advising them of potential alternative funding streams.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

2015 to 30th June 2015 is 63 units in total.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Cian Prendiville, Paul

Keller and John Loftus

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the***

***Government to immediately cease the water meter installation programme and***

***divert those resources and staff to replacing all lead piping. The costs of this***

***programme should be paid for by the state, as in Ballynanty and Kileely.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Keller noted that the State had originally installed, or

approved of the installation of lead piping and it was the State and not the home owner

that should bear the cost of replacing this piping. Members supporting the motion

indicated that some families, even with grant support, could not afford to replace lead

piping and that the programme of lead pipe replacement which had been put in place by

the Council should be continued.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Secas, the following

amended motion was proposed:

“I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on Irish Water to

commit, as a matter of public health and safety, all necessary resources to the

replacement of all lead piping, as a priority”. A vote was taken on the amended motion

with the following result:

**In Favour**

Councillors Butler, Clifford, Collins, Crowley, Daly, Hurley, Leddin, Lynch, O’Dea, Secas

and Sheahan.

(11)

**Against**

Councillors Gilligan, Keller, Loftus, McCreesh, Ó Ceallaigh and Quinlivan

(6).

The Mayor declared the amended motion carried.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council review proposals to build Social***

***Housing in Clonmacken.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Crowley and seconded by Councillor Lynch.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Crowley pointed out that, while he acknowledged the

urgent need for social housing, the site in this case was unsuitable for housing or use as---
8

a green area as it was prone to flooding and was too remote with no shops, schools or

churches nearby.

On the proposal of Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Daly it was agreed to

suspend standing orders for a further thirty minutes to facilitate the completion of the

agenda.

**REPLY:**

In March 2015, Limerick City & County Council received ‘approval in

principle’ for four projects from the Department of Environment, Community

and Local Government. The Clonmacken project is set to deliver 40

Housing Units at a cost of €7,120,000 by 2017.

The location was chosen having regard to the existing distribution of social

housing throughout the Limerick City urban area. We are currently

preparing tender documents for the appointment of an Integrated Design

Team for the proposed housing project in Clonmacken.

Prior to an application for planning permission, detailed ground

investigation of the site will be carried out and will include a flood risk

assessment.

It is anticipated that Planning Permission will be sought for this project via

the Part 8 process in Quarter 1/2016. The design of the project will need

approval from the Department of Environment, Community and Local

Government and must have due regard to planning and development

guidelines contained in the Development Plans for Limerick City & County

Council.

Members sought clarity on the suitability of the site but stressed the need for social

housing to be built.

The Senior Executive Officer, Home and Social Development informed Members that a

project appraisal had yet to be carried out in this case and she would revert to Members

when same was available.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

***I will move at the next meeting, in relation to the Westfield Wetlands and Lake***

***Area, that Limerick City and County Council would consider the establishment of***

***an appropriate body, with the ability to generate or attract external funding and***

***work with the continued cooperation and input from the Council, to tackle the***

***issue of overgrowth and decreasing lake area, overgrowth adjacent to the lake,***

***and any other issues affecting the adjacent bank and general wetland area.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Crowley and seconded by Councillor Daly.

In proposing the motion Councillor Crowley called for the establishment of a body that

would oversee the provision of expertise, management and funding of the Westfields

Wetlands and lake area and that would benefit from the professional intervention of

agencies such as Waterways Ireland and Birdwatch Ireland. He stressed the need to

develop this area as a focal point in the city and the need to remove weed growth before

the lake area was lost.---
9

**REPLY:**

The Westfield Wetlands are part of the Lower River Shannon Special Area

of Conservation (SAC). There is an active Westfields Wetlands Group with

whom the Council works closely.

The Council commissioned a report to identify and assess the challenges

associated with maintaining the wetlands, and the 2001 Natura Report for

Westfields outlined the following main recommendations :

· Create open water bodies in the central and western sections.

· Excavate sediment from parts of the water body in the eastern

section.

· Replace the existing water intake from the river with a sluice system.

· Open channels between the four sections of the wetland.

· Remove Japanese knotweed (*Fallopia japonica*).

· Employ a manager/guide.

Arising from this report, should the Council decide to carry out any

significant works to the Wetlands, it would be necessary for the Council in

the first instance to ensure it has the appropriate permissions to carry out

any proposed works in a Special Area of Conservation. It would also be

necessary for the Council to fully cost the implementation of all or part

of these recommendations. No provision has been made in the 2015

budget for any works in Wetlands other than routine maintenance.

The full implementation of the works as outlined above will require a

significant specific resource provision by the Council in its budget 2016.

The Council will also continue to monitor all potential sources of external

funding with a view to securing such funding, if and when available.

Limerick City and County Council will continue to work with the Westfields

Wetlands Group in relation to the conservation of Westfields Wetlands as

part of the Lower River Shannon Special Area of Conservation.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Frankie Daly

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council reinstate the highly***

***successful and worthwhile Street Ambassador (S.A.) programme in Limerick City***

***and the Metropolitan Area to support and help grow tourism by supporting***

***endeavours such as Riverfest, St Patrick's week and for approximately 10-12***

***weeks of the summer period.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Daly and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

In proposing the motion Councillor Daly indicated his surprise that such a worthwhile,

low costing service that presented a friendly face for Limerick should have been

withdrawn.

**REPLY:**

The Limerick Street Ambassadors programme was run by the

Limerick Communications Office (formerly Coordination Office) over the

last ten years or so, until the Limerick Communications office ceased to

exist in 2013. The service was funded by a combination of funds from the---
10

(then) Limerick City Council, Limerick County Council and Shannon

Development.

Limerick Marketing ran the programme on a one off basis in 2014 given

the City of Culture year. For resource issues the programme wasn’t run in

2015 but the restoration of the Limerick Street Ambassadors programme is

under review for future years.

Members welcomed the motion and the following points were made by Members during

discussion:

 The World Medical Games currently underway in University of Limerick, the

upcoming World Rugby Sevens Tournament and the Council’s bid for European City

of Culture 2020 Status all underlined the need for street ambassadors to be put back

in place.

 Should funding not be available in the short term to reinstate street ambassadors, the

organisation, Volunteers Limerick should be contacted to establish if they could

provide a similar service.

 A large volume of signage was appearing on roundabouts and was a traffic hazard.

 The effectiveness of the street ambassador programme should be evaluated and the

benefits of free on street wifi assessed in comparison.

 Limerick Marketing should be requested to come to a future meeting of the District to

present their work programme and plans.

 Local hotels should be requested to support the street ambassador service.

On the proposal of Councillor Byrne, seconded by Councillor Butler, it was agreed that

standing orders should be suspended to facilitate the completion of the agenda.

The Deputy Chief Executive noted that the street ambassador service had been funded

from a number of sources and now resided with the Council. He acknowledged the

need to have the issue reviewed and the service restored as soon as possible.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next meeting*** ***that the Council bring forward plans for members***

***consideration and approval for the upgrade of O'Connell Street and Patrick Street***

***to include public realm works (wider footpaths, street furniture, high quality***

***paving and lighting etc.) similar to those completed on Bedford Row, Thomas***

***Street and Catherine Street.***

Councillor Leddin stated that it would be sufficient for the reply to this motion to be

forwarded to him.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next meeting*** ***that the Council provide details of land in the***

***Metropolitan District, suitable for development or housing purposes, currently in***

***Council ownership and develop plans for such sites, for members consideration.***

**REPLY:**

The Council owns a number of strategic sites in the Metropolitan District;

these are in the main identified in Limerick 2030. Development proposals---
11

are being advanced for these sites in accordance with this Economic and

Spatial Plan.

The Home and Social Development Department are currently reviewing

sites in the Council’s ownership in order to identify sites suitable for

housing purposes, the Elected Members will be briefed on these sites as

part of the Home and Social Development Capital Programme.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor James Collins

***I will move at the next meeting*** ***that Limerick City and County Council provide a***

***suitable site for a community centre for Raheen, Dooradoyle, Mungret and***

***surrounding areas.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

**REPLY**:

A Masterplan is currently being prepared for Mungret and a review of a

number of other sites is currently ongoing as to their suitability for various

uses. The identification of a site for a community centre will form part of the

aforementioned Masterplan and site review process.

In proposing the motion Councillor Collins noted that a masterplan for the area and a

site for community facilities were both awaited. He pointed out the benefits of the

Council site adjacent to Xtra Vision and indicated that discretionary GMA funding

could be allocated to such a site.

Members supported the motion and emphasised the lack of community facilities to

service such a large, populated area.

The Deputy Chief Executive noted the imbalance between sporting and community

facilities in the area and undertook to arrange for staff from Community Development

and the Property Department to meet with Members to discuss this issue.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor James Collins

***I will move at the next meeting that*** ***Limerick City and County Council call on Irish***

***Rail to adequately secure their currently unused rail lines passing by Ballykeefe***

***and Raheen / Dooradoyle as their failure to do so has led to an increase in***

***antisocial behaviour.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Collins noted that access to the rail line was not

secured and hedge clearing works carried out by Irish Rail had facilitated access to

private property adjacent to the line and associated criminal activity.

In seconding the motion Councillor Butler emphasised the need for communication lines

with Irish Rail to be opened in relation to this issue.

Members supported the motion and requested that Irish Rail be asked to remove the

refuse deposited along this section of the rail track.---
12

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

***I will move at the next meeting*** ***that the Limerick Metropolitan District invites the***

***HSE funded Mid-West Regional Drug and Alcohol Forum to give a briefing to***

***elected members outlining the work they do and what services they both deliver***

***and support, especially in the Metropolitan Area of Limerick City.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan, seconded by Councillor Daly and

agreed.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council urgently***

***acquire some of the available landbank adjacent to the new Gaelscoil Chaladh an***

***Treoigh in Castletroy in order to provide the necessary safe access to the school***

***to alleviate the dangerous build up of traffic which parents and children have to***

***endure.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Daly.

**REPLY**:

The landbank adjacent to the Gaelscoil Chaladh an Treoigh in Castletroy is

not in public ownership and initial discussions have taken place in relation

to this matter.

Limerick City & County Council is awaiting an outcome in relation to these

discussions.

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maria Byrne

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council will inspect all rented properties***

***under the RAS and HAP schemes prior to the tenant taking up their tenancy.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Collins.

**REPLY**:

The Home & Social Development Department operate both the Rental

Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and the Housing Assistance Payment

Scheme (HAP).

All properties under the RAS scheme are inspected prior to the Council

entering into a contract for same to ensure compliance with the housing

standards prescribed under Section 18 of the Housing Act 1992. In the

event of minor remedial works being required the landlord is afforded an

opportunity to rectify same and the works are re-inspected upon

completion to ensure compliance. Properties entered under the RAS

scheme are also re-inspected at the completion of the four year contract

and prior to a new contract being entered into with the relevant property

owner.

Inspections of properties entered under the HAP scheme is governed by

Section 41(2)(b) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 which

states that the Housing Authority shall, within a prescribed period after the---
13

date when housing assistance commences, inspect the dwelling to ensure

it complies with Section 18 of the Housing Act 1992. The Housing

Assistance Payment Regulations 2014 (S.I. No 407 of 2014) states under

Section 7 that a local authority is required to inspect a property in receipt of

housing assistance payment within 8 months of receipt of the payment.

In addition, it should be noted that the inspections unit of the Home &

Social Development Department also carry out inspections of private

rented dwellings not under the aforementioned schemes upon receipt of a

written complaint from the tenant and may after inspection issue

improvement notices or prohibition notices further to Section 18 of the

Housing Act 1992. The effect of a prohibition notice is to prevent the

reletting of the property in question until such time as the identified works

have been carried out.

Members noted that not all properties were inspected within eight months and some

were in poor condition. Members also pointed out that there was an anomaly in the

legislation whereby the property could not be inspected if the landlord also lived at the

same location and this legislation should be amended to resolve same.

24.

Correspondence

Correspondence was noted.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Deputy Chief Executive noted that there would be

no District Meeting in August and he wished the Members well for the holiday period.

Good wishes were also extended to Councillor Maria Byrne during her trip to Los

Angeles for the Special Olympics.

This concluded the Meeting.

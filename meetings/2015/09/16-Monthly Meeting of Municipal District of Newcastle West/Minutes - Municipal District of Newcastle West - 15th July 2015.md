QUESTIONS

7. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will ask at the next Meeting if the small section of footpath at the entrance to
the church in Athea village can be repaired.

REPLY: Works on this footpath will be carried out as part of the 2015 Roads
Programme for the Newcastle West Municipal District.

8. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will ask at the next Meeting for the up-to-date position regarding provision of
graveyard in Abbeyfeale.

REPLY: The Council has been actively pursuing a suitable site for the development
of a new cemetery for Abbeyfeale for some time. Unfortunately it has
proven difficult to identify a suitable site due to ground conditions in the
Abbeyfeale area. The Council is currently considering all options for the
provision of cemetery in this area.

9. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council has a policy that
covers the cutting and collection of grass in Housing Estates by Contractors.

REPLY: The Council awards an annual grass cutting contract which stipulates that
the areas detailed in the contract are to be cut on a fortnightly basis. It is
the policy not to collect the grass but to let it biodegrade at the site of
cutting. This achieves a considerable cost saving and is environmentally
the most desirable option.

Members stated that the policy of not collecting grass when cut was leaving estates in a
dreadful state and that drains were in danger of becoming blocked from loose grass.
The Members asked, if possible, could the contractor in question be requested to collect
the first cut of grass of the season. The Operations Manager, West and South Division
agreed to make contact with the Senior Executive Officer, Environment in relation to this

matter.

10. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will ask at the next Meeting what funds were allocated for Cemetery upkeep and
maintenance within the Newcastle West Area and also what income was
generated from the sale of graves within the area for 2013, 2014 and 2015.

REPLY: The amounts allocated for Cemetery upkeep and maintenance within
Newcastle West Area are as follows:

*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
2015 €35,000

Burial Ground Committees also carry out maintenance works in
cemeteries and the Council supports these committees through payment
of a burial ground grant. It is estimated that approximately 30 such grants
will be provided in the area in 2015 at a cost of €10,000.

In addition to these resources, the Council is also supported by FAS and
West Limerick Resources in the upkeep and maintenance of cemeteries in
the Newcastle West area. These works are carried out by Community
Employment Schemes, TUS Schemes and Rural Social Schemes.

All monies receipted for the sale of graves in Newcastle West area are
allocated to a general burial fees income code. | estimate that
approximately €40,000 was generated in 2014 from the sale of graves in
the Newcastle West area.

41. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting the cost of the railing placed along the riverbank
walk between the Courtney Bridge and North Quay.

REPLY: This railing along the Arra River was erected as part of a Public
Enhancement Scheme in 2014. This scheme was 75% funded by the
Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with
the Council responsible for the 25% balance. The railing cost €15,000 to

erect.

12. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting if the parking space, outside what was a former
nightclub, along South Quay Newcastle West, which was recently denoted
Loading Bay, can be reinstated for ordinary parking use.

REPLY: The Newcastle West Parking Bye Laws 2013 allow for a loading bay at
South Quay. The amending of this loading bay to ordinary parking can only
be considered in a review of these Bye Laws.

13. Question submitted by Councillor M. Collins

| will ask at the next Meeting if the wall at ‘Fullers Folly’ accessing the river from
Bridge Street can be repaired, made safe and the gate reopened when completed.

REPLY: The area of ground in question is not registered to Limerick City and
County Council and the Council has been unable to establish the
registered owner. In the meantime the gate will remain closed in the

interest of public safety.

A number of other issues were raised in relation to the wall and Councillor Collins stated
that he would make enquiries from local people to try and establish the registered

owner.

NOTICES OF MOTION
14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that
Limerick City and County Council provide adequate lighting at Feenagh Cemetery
so as to ensure that property stored in it is protected from vandalism.

Councillor Scanlan, in proposing the Motion, stated that there was a need for lighting at
Feenagh Cemetery.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

REPLY: The budget provided by the Council in 2015 does not provide for the
improvements as requested above. The Council will consider this request
in the context of the 2016 works programme for cemeteries, subject to the
necessary resources being made available for such improvement works.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that the
National Roads Authority be requested to provide safety measures at Lacey's
Cross and at Upper Barnagh along the N21 in the immediate interest of public

safety.

Councillor Scanlan, in proposing the Motion, stated that there was a need for safety
measures to be put in place as a matter or urgency.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY: A road safety inspection was recently carried out on the N21 by the
National Roads Authority. No particular safety issues were highlighted at

either Lacey's Cross or Upper Barnagh.

The Members requested that contact be made with the National Roads Authority with a
view to finding out who carried out the Safety Inspection.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that
measures be put in place to stop the traffic eroding the bank fronting the hedge at
Curtin’s bend, Church Road, Templeglantine.

REPLY: This matter has been investigated and the existing signage in this area will
be improved to alert oncoming traffic of the bend ahead.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

|! will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that
funding be provided to repair and preserve the Cistercian Church, Fairy Street,

Athea.

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
REPLY: Templeathea Church and graveyard are Recorded Monuments, LI034-
004001/002, protected under the National Monuments Act (Amendments)
1930-2004. They are contained within the medieval civil parish of
Rathronan (“Mount Temple belongs to Rathronan") and there are historical
references to the church in 1410, 1418 and 1586. In 1645 it is again
recorded that the chapel of Mount Temple belongs to the rectory of
Rathronan. It is not recorded as a Cistercian foundation but probably
functioned as a secondary church in the large parish of Rathronan.

The graveyard was vested in the Burial Board for Newcastle West Sanitary
District in the 1880s and subsequently in the Local Authority. The building
is dated to the late medieval period. It is quite complete though lacking its
gables and in relatively good repair. It is being taken over by ivy and
vegetation but from a preliminary inspection there is no section of the
building showing stress.

There is a limited budget available for all works required in graveyards
throughout the county. A relatively small amount of this budget is allotted to
conservation projects. It would not be a justified use of the available
funding to carry out significant works to this building, having regard to the
state of the building relative to many others which are showing immediate
signs of distress.

In the medium term it may be possible to work with the local community,
using best practice, to control the vegetation currently accumulating on the
building.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

| will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that
funding be reinstated to erect a bridge on the Oolagh River and remove a
concrete slab from the river which prevents salmon and trout from entering the

prime spawning river for the Feale.

Councillor Browne, in proposing the Motion, stated that there was a need for the slab to
be removed as this was having an adverse affect on fishing in the river. It was causing
an economic and ecological problem.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

The Operations Manager, West and South Division, stated that a meeting on site would
be arranged with the anglers and Executive Engineer, Roads to discuss the matter.
REPLY:

This matter had been investigated and our records show that this area
was private property.

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

! will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that
€15,000 be allocated from the General Municipal Allocation to Westfest Festival
Committee to assist in the running of the 2015 event.

Councillor Collins in proposing the Motion for the allocation of €15,000 from the General
Municipal Allocation to Westfest Festival Committee stated that the festival which had
been running for four years had generated great goodwill in the community and was of
immense economic and social benefit to West Limerick.

This was seconded by Councillor Scanlan and agreed.

REPLY: The recently submitted accounts of Westfest have been examined by our
Finance Department and they have no objections in this regard. Allocation
of the General Municipal Allocation is a matter for Members of the
Municipal District. If it is agreed by the members that funding be allocated
to Westfest, arrangements can be made to allocate the relevant funding
from General Municipal Allocation.

20. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

! will move at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West that
€15,000 be allocated from the General Municipal Allocation, to Newcastle West
Chamber of Commerce and Newcastle West Community Council, to fund a
feasibility study which will research and coordinate all clubs, organisations,
residents groups and interested parties with a view to establishing a
Development Association for Newcastle West, that will act as a united voice for
all. A steering group has been established to coordinate this study.

Councillor Collins in proposing the Motion to allocate €15,000 from the General
Municipal Allocation fund to carry out a feasibility study stated that it was very important
to have a united voice for Newcastle West. It was good to see smaller groups come
together to have a co-ordinated approach to community and economic planning and set
up a Development Association for Newcastle West.

This was seconded by Councillor Scanlan and agreed.

REPLY: Limerick City and County Council acknowledges the expression of interest
by the Newcastle West Chamber of Commerce and the Newcastle West
Community Council towards the development of community
representatives structures with a view to achieving a more co-ordinated
approach to community and economic planning at local level. It is noted
that this initiative is being led by local stakeholders, and that a steering
group has been established to co-ordinate this study. Allocation of the
General Municipal Allocation is a matter for the Members of the Municipal
District, however the Head of Finance has expressed that he would
welcome further clarity of this funding. If it is agreed by the Members that
funding be allocated to setting up this Development Association,
arrangements can be made to allocate the relevant funding from the
General Municipal Allocation.

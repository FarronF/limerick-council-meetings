OFFICIALS IN ATTENDANCE:

An apology for his inability to attend the Meeting was received from the Director of
Travel and Transportation.

The Cathaoirleach stated that the Special Meeting had been convened to discuss
the allocation of funds from the General Municipal Allocation following receipt of a
Requisition signed by a number of Members as follows:

“We, Councillors Michael Collins, John Sheahan and Francis Foley ask
the Chairman of Newcastle West District Council to convene a Special
Meeting to allocate €50,000.00 to the Regional Athletics Facility at
Killeline, Newcastle West.”

Signed: Councillors M. Collins, J. Sheahan, F. Foley.

Councillor Collins addressed the Meeting and said the proposal included the
purchase of a seven acre site to accommodate an eight lane 400 metre track with
parking, toilets, storage sheds and changing areas. The total estimated cost of the
project, he said, was in the region of €980,000. He highlighted that the provision of a
sports and recreational facility would significantly enhance the quality of life and
would encourage participation, promote health and wellbeing and foster a sense of
community. He stated that what was required from the General Municipal Allocation
was funding to undertake a feasibility study for the project.

Councillor Collins added that clarification had been sought from the Chief Executive
and Head of Finance in relation to the criteria for allocating funds, under the Special
Projects Category, from the General Municipal Allocation. He stated that it was
confirmed, that the Members could allocate an unspecified amount of money from
the Special Projects Category and use it towards the cost of the feasibility study in
this case. The exact amount to be allocated was left open as no figure had yet been
put on the cost of the study, but it was estimated that it would cost in the region of
€5,000 - €20,000. In light of this information, he said he wished to amend the amount
sought in the Requisition. He concluded by stating that the project did fit the criteria
of a strategic item and should provide a legacy going forward.

On the proposal of Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Sheahan, it was
agreed to provide funding for the feasibility study for the Development of the
Regional Athletics Facility at Newcastle West from the Special Projects Category of
the General Municipal Allocation.

The Members unanimously indicated their support for the proposal and asked to be
kept informed of cost/progress on the preparation of the study.

Other items referred to at the Meeting:

e Location of Facility - when choosing a site, there would be a need to be
conscious of cost.

e The need to put in place proper criteria for allocating funding from the General
Municipal Allocation.

Cathaoirleach

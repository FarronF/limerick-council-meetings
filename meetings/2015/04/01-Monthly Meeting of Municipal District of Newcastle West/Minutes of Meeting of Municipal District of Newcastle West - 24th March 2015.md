The Cathaoirleach and Members commended the Deputation for their presentations
and thanked them for hosting the Municipal District Meeting in the Community Centre.

A discussion took place on the presentations and the Members asked if some of the
smaller issues could be addressed immediately, in particular, the removal of the tree at
the entrance to Hawthorns Estate. It was noted that funding was limited and that the
construction of the footpath from St. Joseph’s Foundation House to the village was a
substantial infrastructural project. It was agreed that the Members would seek a meeting
with the Office of Public Works and the Minister in relation to the transfer of ownership
of the Garda Station to the local community.

The Executive Archaeologist addressed the Meeting and provided an update in relation
to proposed schedule of works for the Abbey. She stated that a structural survey had
been undertaken and that, as a result of same, it was noted that the preservation work
would be carried out in three or more phases. The first phase, she outlined, would
involve cutting back the trees and then drilling and treating the roots. Some propping
and boarding off would also be necessary in order to stabilise the building. She
estimated that this phase would cost in the region of €125,000. Later phases, she
explained, would involve repairing the cavities left by the roots, removing other
vegetation, consolidating the south- east corner and north wall and capping of the walls.
She confirmed that grants would be applied for where possible. In conclusion, she
referred to survey of graves that had been carried out and which would be available on
the historicgraves.ie site.

The Cathaoirleach, Members and representatives from the local community thanked her
for her comprehensive presentation and stated that they were pleased to hear that
works were progressing on the preservation and protection of the Abbey.

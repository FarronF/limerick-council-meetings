January, 2015, enclosing copy of the Chief Executive‟s Report to Members dated 29th

January, 2015, on the Proposed Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021.

The Chief Executive‟s Report presented the submissions made following publication of the

Proposed Adare Local Area Plan Material Alterations and set out the Chief Executive‟s

responses to the issues raised and any proposed further modifications to the material

alterations. It was noted that the Proposed Adare Local Area Plan Material Alterations

were placed on public display from 13th December, 2014 to 21st January, 2015, inclusive

and that a total of 5 written submissions were received within the statutory timeframe. It

was recommended that the Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021 be made in accordance with

the Chief Executive‟s Report dated 29th January, 2015.---
2

Members indicated that they had postponed a decision on the Proposed Adare Local Area

Plan 2015-2021 at the February District Meeting as they could not make an informed

decision on zoning in the absence of the CFRAM flood maps for Adare. Members

indicated that they were extremely disappointed that the OPW had not responded to a

request that the CFRAM flood maps for Adare be available for the March District Meeting

and a number of Members indicated that they would not approve of the Proposed Plan in

light of these circumstances.

Councillor Keary referred to Items 12 and 13 on the Agenda and indicated that a

representative from the OPW had been requested to attend to brief Members on the

reason for the construction of flood defence embankments adjacent to the river Maigue on

the Northern side of the Adare Manor lands and whether the works could give rise to an

increased potential risk of flooding of adjacent property and downstream on Station Road.

The Members were advised that the OPW had responded and indicated that they were

unable to attend the Meeting.

Discussion took place in relation to two sites referred to as Hogan‟s Lands and Fitzgerald‟s

Lands on Submission Nos. 27-30 and Submission No. 31 respectively in the Chief

Executives Report dated 4th November, 2014. The Senior Executive Planner pointed out

to the Members that, as the Planning Authority, they had a duty to make or amend the

Local Area Plan and a decision in relation to same would have to be taken at the current

Meeting. She stressed that there would not be regulated planning for Adare if the Local

Area Plan was not adopted.

The Senior Planner indicated that it was unprecedented not to adopt the Local Area Plan.

He indicated that the Office of Pubic Works (OPW) was the lead agency for flood risk

management and was responsible for protecting lands from flooding. He pointed out that

the Office of Public Works (OPW), The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) and The

Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government had recommended

that the Hogan Lands and Fitzgerald Lands revert back to Open Space and Recreation as

was set out in the draft plan and that the Chief Executive‟s Report had incorporated these

recommendations as these lands are located in areas deemed to be at risk of flooding.

The Senior Executive Planner repeated her concerns in relation to potential risk of flooding

of land referred to in Submission Nos. 27-30 and Submission No. 31 in the Chief

Executive‟s Report dated 4th November, 2014. She stated that any changes proposed

needed to be precise and it would be necessary for the Members to put forward the basis

for departing from the Chief Executive‟s recommendations.

Proposed by Councillor Keary;

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan;

And Resolved:

"That, the Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021 be made in accordance with the Chief

Executive's recommendations dated 29th January, 2015, under Section 20(3)(n) of the

Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), subject to the following two

amendments –

(i) that Submission Nos. 27-30 be changed from Open Space and Recreation to

„Residential Phase 2‟ as agreed at the Municipal District Meeting on the 2nd December,

2014 as these lands had never flooded and the datum levels were significantly higher than

the lands adjoining Station Road; there would be no impact on the core strategy as phase---
3

one lands must be developed firstand

(ii) that Submission No. 31 be changed from Open Space and Recreation to „Existing

Residential‟ as agreed at the Municipal District Meeting on the 11th November, 2014 as

these lands form the curtilage of the existing house; the lands were previously zoned

residential in the 2009 LAP; any application on this site would require compliance with

Objective IN5 Flood Risk Management of the proposed plan in relation to flood risk

assessment."

The Senior Executive Planner advised the Members of the implications of deviating from

the Chief Executive recommendations in that the Adare Local Area Plan may be reviewed

by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Development.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach it was agreed to take the following urgent item,

which was not on the Agenda, at this point in the Meeting.

**Former Andersen Building in Rathkeale**

Circulated, copy of correspondence from Mr. Michael Cantwell, Head of Innovate Limerick

dated 9th March, 2015 in which Mr. Michael Cantwell gave a description of the intended

property for disposal, details of which would be going to the full Council for approval.

It was noted that Innovate Limerick Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Limerick City and

County Council, purchased the former Anderson Building in Rathkeale in 2014 after its

closure earlier that year. It had been purchased from the Receivers PWC with the view to

attracting businesses into smaller units within the 125,000 sq. ft building.

Mr. Cantwell pointed out that the Council‟s approval would be sought for the disposal of

25,000 sq. ft. of the plant to Mr. Paul Collins, Design Pro Ltd. who design and build high

end robotic equipment. Design Pro Ltd., currently based in Ballinvullen Business Park,

Newcastle West, had outgrown their existing facility and expect to increase their staff to 70

within the next two to three years. In addition, the Council‟s approval would be sought for

the disposal of 3,000 sq. ft. and approximately 1 acre of the site to Fitzel and Long,

Veterinary Practice. Local charity Butterfly Club were seeking approval for the leasing of

3,000 sq. ft. on a ten year lease.

Members commended Innovate Limerick on their success in attracting businesses to the

former Anderson site and the employment opportunity it had created.

During the course of the discussion Members highlighted the importance of attracting

small and medium sized indigenous enterprises to the County. Councillor Sheahan

indicated that Shannon Development and the IDA had been unsuccessful in securing a

major employer for the 240 acre site in Askeaton Industrial Estate and proposed that 40

acres of the 240 acres site be designated for small and medium sized indigenous

industries that could facilitate the needs of Foynes Port. This was seconded by Councillor

Tom Neville.

Mr. Cantwell indicated that, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the mid west is currently in

the process of compiling its action plan under the guidance of Enterprise Ireland and that

the development of smaller sites at Askeaton could be included as part of the Mid West

Action Plan.---

As the Garda representatives were available it was agreed to take item 4 on the agenda at

this point.

4.

An Garda Siochána

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Thomas O‟Connor and Sergeant Niall Flood

from Newcastle West District Garda Station to the Meeting.

Members highlighted the importance of representatives from An Garda Siochána attending

Municipal District Meetings and suggested that these Meetings occur on a regular basis.

During the course of the discussion Members highlighted the benefits of the Public

Information Meeting that had been held the previous evening in Askeaton where

representatives from An Garda Siochána had met with members of the community.

The following issues were raised by Members during the course of the discussion:

 The benefit of increased visibility of An Garda Siochána.

 That the areas of Croom, Ballingarry and Manister need extra policing.

 That „Text Alert‟ was invaluable to rural areas and should be encouraged as it

helped to protect the elderly and vulnerable.

 That people need to be aware of their own personal security and take appropriate

precautions.

 The benefits of re-establishment of Joint Policing Committee.

 That motorists were using Castleroberts and other areas as a short-cut to avoid

Adare due to the traffic congestion in the village

In response to queries raised by Members the Superintendent pointed out that there was a

high level of agricultural burglaries with the theft of diesel, oil, tools and machinery. It was

believed that relatives of Limerick criminals, with local knowledge, were linked to these

crimes.

He noted that the Newcastle West district covered 121 square kilometres, which was the

same size as County Monaghan, and all areas of the district are patrolled. He added that

the Garda fleet was in excellent condition and indicated that three retirements would occur

in the next three years and he would be applying to Templemore for new recruits.

Referring to the theft at Ballingarry creamery, Sergeant Niall Flood noted that a Garda

crime prevention officer had visited the creamery and local businesses and given advice

on improving security.

Economic Development and Planning

**(b)**

**Limerick City & County Council Business & Retail Incentive Scheme for**

**Vacant Property in Limerick City Centre, Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock, Newcastle**

**West and Rathkeale**

Circulated report on the Limerick City and County Council Business and Retail Incentive

Scheme for Vacant Property from the Director, Economic Development and Planning,

dated 10th February, 2015 and associated application form and guidelines for Business

and Retail Incentives Scheme for Vacant Properties Grant.---
5

Ms. Mary Hayes, Administrative Officer, Economic Development and Planning presented

proposal to extend the Business and Retail Incentive Scheme from 01/01/2015 to

31/12/2016.

She noted that the scheme offered incentives for the occupation of vacant retail and

business units in city and town centres through the provision of grant aid in designated

areas. These areas included Limerick City Centre, Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock, Newcastle

West and Rathkeale. Under the scheme new businesses received grant relief over two

years for occupation of vacant premises with higher order retail type uses and business

uses. An example of higher order retail use types can include fashion outlets – both

multiple and independent stores, „lifestyle stores‟, flagship stores, niche and specialist

retailers such as home furnishings, beauty products, jewellery and books. The grant relief

provided for the certified fit-out costs of vacant premises up to the value of 50% of

commercial rates payable in the first year of operation and 25% in the second year.

Members thanked Ms. Hayes for her presentation and raised the following issues in

relation to same:-

Members indicated that the scheme should be extended as other towns deserved to be

included. Councillor Sheahan proposed that towns of over 1,000 inhabitants be included

and this was seconded by Councillor Keary. Councillor Sheahan further stated that

Askeaton should be included in the current Business and Retail Incentive Scheme pointing

out that Askeaton is home to the two biggest employers and rate payers in the region

namely Wyeth and Aughinish. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Keary.

The Senior Planner stated that significant vacancy still remain in the defined core retail

areas of city and town centres and stated that any extension of the scheme would dilute

the potential impact of the scheme, which should be given an opportunity to achieve its

objectives and then extended to other areas. He added that the scheme could be

reviewed in six months time.

3.

Environment and Water

Gortadroma Landfill

The Head of Finance indicated that a site visit to a gasification facility in France, to view a

similar plant in operation to the one being proposed for Gortadroma Landfill, was

organised for 11th and 12th March, 2015 for Members, Council Staff and local resident

representatives.

The Head of Finance added that the proposed lease of lands at Gortadroma would go to

the full Council for approval.

5.

Request to Receive Deputation from Friends of the Great Southern

Trail

Councillor Neville indicated that a request to receive a deputation had been received from

Friends of the Great Southern Trail with regard to planning the connecting link between the

this held. On the proposal of Councillor Neville, seconded by Councillor O‟Donoghue it

was agreed to receive this deputation at the next Meeting.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor Stephen Keary

***I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council would consider***

***purchasing a 1.30 hectare plot of ground off Main Street, Adare, to accommodate***

***much needed car parking in the Town Centre. This land can be accessed from the***

***existing roundabout in the centre of the town. The proposed zoning for the said***

***lands to be agreed at the March Meeting is to change it from "Town Centre Mixed***

***Uses" to "Open Space and Recreation". Can the Executive please provide clarity on***

***the above item.***

REPLY:

The land in question is located on lands identified as flood zone A, and it is

for this reason that the Department of the Environment, the OPW and the

EPA reported that the land is not suitable for residential zoning. Currently

there is no direct access to these lands from the existing roundabout and the

provision of an access would not be acceptable on capacity grounds, until

such time that a bypass is provided for the town. Also, any access at this

location would have to traverse the existing town park and the impact on the

amenity of this would have to be assessed further.---

NOTICES OF MOTION

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Emmett O'Brien

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council undertake an***

***assessment of the level of fly tipping and illegal dumping in the Carnane, Fedamore***

***area and address the Meeting how it proposes to arrest this dumping.***

Councillor O‟Brien, in proposing the Motion, stated that there was a high level of fly tipping

in the Carnane, Fedamore area and throughout the County. He called for CCTV cameras

to be installed in areas where there was pronounced levels of illegal dumping. The Motion

was seconded by Councillor Neville. Councillor Sheahan stated that in many cases CCTV

cameras have not resulted in prosecutions as the individuals involved could not be

identified as they were wearing hoodies.

REPLY:

The problem of fly tipping and illegal dumping in the Carnane, Fedamore

area has declined in recent years. However, the Council continues to

monitor illegal dumping in this area. The Council requires that householders

have arrangements in place for the disposal of their refuse. In this regard,

the Council has contacted householders in the area to establish if they have

a refuse collection service in place. The Council continues to follow up with

householders who have not responded to this request for information.

Illegal dumping signage has been erected. The Council will erect additional

illegal dumping signage if specific areas are identified. The Council will also

erect temporary cameras in a specific site, if same is identified.

The Council also encourages groups to participate in clean ups in their area

and in Team Limerick Clean Up which will take place on the 3rd April next.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Emmett O'Brien

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will improve***

***the junction of Plunkett Road and L1221 to allow safe access onto the road.***

Councillor O‟Brien proposed the Motion and the Motion was seconded by Councillor

Neville.

REPLY:

The roads engineer has inspected the junction and will carry out a detailed

assessment to determine what remedial action may be required at the above

location.---

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Stephen Keary

***I will move at the next Meeting that in light of the obvious abandonment of the***

***"Rapid Project" for Rathkeale Town by this Authority that the Chief Executive of***

***Limerick City and County Council will ask the Minister with responsibility for this***

***process to directly appoint a co-ordinator to continue the process for the people of***

***Rathkeale Town***

Councillor Keary, in proposing the Motion, expressed his concern that there had not been

a RAPID co-ordinator in the Rathkeale area for the past 16 months and that this created a

lack of co-operation between agencies and the community. The Motion was seconded by

Councillor O‟Brien.

REPLY:

The Council continues to support the RAPID Programme in the four Limerick

RAPID areas within the context of the withdrawal of national funding for

RAPID in 2013. The Council allocates programme funding to all RAPID

areas and a Council staff member continues to work with agencies in those

areas to advance the RAPID aims of improved service co-ordination and

community engagement.

Members expressed disappointment with the reply. The Head of Finance indicated that he

would speak with the Director of Community, Leisure and Emergency Services on this

matter.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Stephen Keary

***I will move at the next meeting that any works to be carried out at Graigeen Cross***

***on the R518 Rathkeale to Askeaton road will include re-alignment works to the***

***adjacent railway level crossing immediately North of this cross.***

Councillor Keary, in proposing the Motion, queried if funding was being made available for

the project. The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan

REPLY:

On Tuesday the 23rd of February a contractor for Iarnrod Eireann (IE)

carried out works on their crossing, XF054, which is on the R518, Rathkeale

to Askeaton Road. The work involved the installation of a macadam surface

over the railway crossing. This work resulted in a "ramp" type structure being

placed on the R518 which had serious H&S implications. The work came to

the attention of the Rathkeale office on the 24th of February and signage

was put in place immediately to highlight the hazard. Contact was made with

IE and a meeting was held on the 25th of February. IE agreed to remove the

"ramp" and works were completed on the 26th of February.

In relation to realignment of the crossing it is proposed that the Rathkeale

Roads Engineer will write to IE requesting a meeting to discuss the matter.

The following items were raised by Members at the completion of the Agenda.---
11

Councillor O‟Brien referred to a report in The Irish Examiner whereby some Local

Authorities had not spend all their allocated funding on coastal repairs, resulting from last

year devastating storms, and asked if this funding could be used for flood defences, other

than coastal.

Councillor O‟Donoghue requested an up-date on a landowner‟s offer of a strip of land at

Croom to facilitate the completion of footpaths.

Councillor Sheahan referred to Notice of Motion previously submitted by him to the full

Council in which he requested Limerick City and County Council to introduce a programme

which would provide water supplies to Burial Ground which did not already have a supply

and the reply to same which had indicated that the finance for such a project was not

available. He noted that a water supply had been provided at Kilcornan Burial Ground and

queried when, by whom and at what cost the connection had been provided and who

would pay for the ongoing cost of the connection. Councillor Sheahan also queried if other

burial grounds had been granted a water supply.

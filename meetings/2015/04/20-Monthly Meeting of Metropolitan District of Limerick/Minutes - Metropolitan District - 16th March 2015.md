Economic Development and Planning

**(a)**

**Proposed Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2015** **–** **2021**

Circulated, Report of the Chief Executive dated 11th March 2015, on the proposed

Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2015 – 2021.

The Chief Executive’s Report presented the submissions made following publication of

the Proposed Patrickswell Local Area Plan Alterations and set out the Chief Executive’s

response to the written submissions received within the statutory timeframe and

recommended that the Patrickswell Local Area Plan be made in accordance with Section---
20 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

Members welcomed the proposed plan and a query was raised in relation to an urban

renewal project for Patrickswell and when the design and plans for same might be

delivered. The Senior Engineer indicated that proposals in relation to this scheme were

being submitted as part of a number of capital schemes for consideration.

Proposed by Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor Lynch, and resolved;

“That the Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2015 – 2021 be made in accordance with the

Chief Executive’s recommendations dated 11th March, 2015 under Section 20(3)(n) of

the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

**(b)**

**Taking in Charge of Estates** **–** **Declaration of Roads to be Public Roads**

Members welcomed the taking in charge of the estates outlined and sought information

in relation to what other estates were due to be taken in charge and what was delaying

same. Members made specific reference to Meadowbrook Estate and the condition of

its roads and reference was also made to the poor standard of some estates that had

been taken in charge and the need to carry out works on the footpaths in some of the

older estates.

The Senior Engineer made the following points in response to issues raised by

Members:

 The Council was engaged in a legal process in relation to Meadowbrook and at

present had no authority to carry out works on the estate. The Council had

written to the developer in relation to the poor quality of the roads and was

seeking payout from the bond in relation to same. Any issues relating to sewers

would be a matter for Irish Water.

 Taking in charge of estates can be a lengthy process with various departments

required to report on the condition of the estate and the bond then accessed to

fund any required works.

 Any footpath repairs were being prioritised from current budgets which were

reducing each year.

 In excess of 100 estates were still to be taken in charge, not all of which would

have requested to be taken in charge.

 There was no formal procedure for informing residents that an estate had been

taken in charge and this would be reviewed.

The Deputy Chief Executive highlighted the challenges faced by the Council in keeping

pace with demand in this area and stressed that the issue could only be dealt with

incrementally. He suggested that a report addressing the queries raised by Members be

brought to a future meeting of the District.

Proposed by Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor O’Dea and resolved;

“That the following housing estates be taken in charge in accordance with S.180 of the

Planning & Development Acts 2000-2014 and S.11 of the Roads Act 1993;

1. Caisleann na hAbhann (part of)

2. Castlecourt, Courtbrack Avenue---
3. Castlewell Close, Courtbrack Avenue

4. Castlewell, Courtbrack Avenue

5. Dooradoyle Park, Dooradoyle

6. Fitzhaven, Courtbrack Avenue

7. Kylemore, Castletroy

8. Newtown Park, Annacotty

3.

Home and Social Development

Sean Coughlan (Financial Accountant) circulated and presented an update on Housing

Assistance Payments (HAP) which included the following:

 An overview of HAP eligibility and how the system operates.

 Details of Local Authorities already included in the pilot with a general roll out

planned during 2015 / 2016.

 Conditions under which HAP is paid.

 An overview of HAP from the perspective of the landlord.

 Details and advantages of the Limerick Transactional Shared Service Hub.

 Analysis of HAP tenancies.

Members thanked the Financial Accountant for his presentation and the following points

were raised by Members in relation to same.

 It is wrong to consider that a family’s housing need is met through receipt of HAP

as there is no security of tenure. Social housing should be provided in place of

HAP.

 Rent caps are too low and with many landlords not interested in accommodating

tenants in receipt of rent supplement or HAP it is very difficult for tenants to

source affordable private accommodation. A form of rent control should be

introduced.

 HAP was now replacing rent supplement which had been intended as a short

term solution but had been turned into a long term solution. The Council’s

involvement in HAP amounted to the administration of a payment rather than

acting as a housing authority.

 The HAP scheme encouraged labour activation and did not promote poverty

traps. The fact that rent was paid directly to the landlord would encourage more

landlords to engage with the scheme.

 A good level of tenancy support had been provided for RAS tenants and the same

should be provided for HAP tenants.

 The absence of a contract with the landlord was seen as a negative aspect of the

scheme and it was perceived that there was inadequate enforcement in relation

to the condition of the property, both inside and out.

 HAP represented payments to private landlords in the absence of social housing.

Cuts in rent supplement was leading to homelessness, with a hidden homeless

sector staying with friends and relatives.

The Deputy Chief Executive stressed that there was no single solution in the area of

housing supports and that the policy around HAP would evolve over time.---
In response to issues raised by Members, the Financial Accountant clarified the

following:

 The Department of Social Protection has paid deposits on behalf of tenants in

exceptional circumstances.

 Rents paid under HAP are only up to the rent supplement caps and efforts are

underway to establish from landlords if tenants are paying a portion of rent in

excess of these caps.

 In relation to alleged anti-social behaviour, the Council investigates, in conjunction

with the Garda, and suspends the payment to the landlord where anti-social

behaviour is found to have occurred.

 Payment to the landlord is also suspended where the landlord does not have tax

clearance, where the property is not up to standard or where the tenant does not

pay their rent to the Council.

 Movement from RAS to HAP is not provided for at present.

 While properties must be inspected within eight months, specific complaints will

be acted on.

 The rent payable by the tenant is in accordance with the differential rent for the

Local Authority area.

 The homeless unit continued to work with the most vulnerable citizens and the

Council also operated a range of social housing options.

 It was anticipated that operation of the Limerick Transactional Shared Service

Hub would contribute in the region of €200,000 to the Council and this had been

factored into the 2015 budget.

NOTICES OF MOTION

attracts participants at a very high standard and with small modifications the skateboard

park could be the location for more national competitions.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council continues to monitor the use of the

skateboard park and it has achieved its original objectives. The Council

welcomes any suggestions for improvements that will make the skateboard

park more attractive to users and will engage with the user groups.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council compile a***

***report on the level of usage of our cycle lanes and develop a strategic plan as to***---
***how we encourage cyclists to use them through public consultation.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler stressed the need to engage with the public to

establish how we can encourage more people to use the cycling infrastructure provided

and promote the health benefits of this activity.

**REPLY**:

In 2012 the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport announced that a

joint submission by Limerick City Council & Limerick County Council in

partnership with the University of Limerick was ranked first, out of 39

applications, in what was described as an “Excellent Proposal” to promote

Smarter Travel in the greater Limerick City area.

The Limerick City Area is Ireland’s Smarter Travel Demonstration City Area

during the period 2012-2016. It will be a pioneering city for sustainable

transport in Ireland and will be among the most innovative leaders in

Ireland in terms of transport policy and investment which will see a €9

million investment over the period to 2016. The demonstration area

consist of four hubs within Limerick City and environs, the UL/Castletroy

hub, the Southside regeneration hub, the Corbally hub and the City Centre

hub. The aim of the scheme is to transform people’s travel behaviour,

through a programme of behavioural change and infrastructural works

which will provide good quality shared surface walking and cycling paths.

The infrastructural works programme commenced in 2013 and is ongoing,

as part of this work pedestrian / cyclist traffic counters where installed in

February 2015 and tracking has commenced. Details of cycle usage will

be available in the coming months.

Limerick Smarter Travel team is currently engaged in developing The

Limerick Metropolitan Cycle Network Plan. The aim is to provide a

framework to facilitate the use of cycling as a mode of transport within the

Limerick Metropolitan Area in both the short term and long term. Once the

Draft Plan is complete it will go out to public consultation in May 2015 and

people will be welcome to comment and put forward suggestions.

All details of the Limerick Smarter Travel programme are available on the

Limerick Smarter Travel website.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council erect a suitable monument to***

***mark the resting place of those who were formerly buried in the Abbey Area and***

***then reinterred in Mount St. Oliver***.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Daly

In proposing the motion, Councillor Gilligan spoke of the extent of the remains that had

been uncovered in the Abbey Area during road construction and subsequently reinterred

in Mount St. Oliver and how it would be appropriate to mark same with the erection of a

suitable monument in Mount St. Oliver.---
**REPLY**:

The Council will arrange a suitable monument to mark those formerly

buried in the Abbey area and now reinterred in Mt. St. Oliver Cemetery.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council calls for a review of the quality,***

***quantity and location of CCTV cameras in Limerick City Centre. This is to***

***determine the efficiency of CCTV in the city, and if it is effective enough to record***

***crimes, and identify criminals.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor

McCreesh.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh stressed that CCTV cameras played an

important role in crime prevention and detection in the city, were a crucial tool in the

justice system and as such it was important that the network of CCTV cameras was

adequate and effective.

The following points were raised by Members during discussion of the motion:

 That garda and traffic cameras were very efficient and no evidence had been

provided to the contrary and consideration should be given to forwarding the

motion to the Joint Policing Committee for review.

 That CCTV coverage should be extended beyond the present areas and that

consideration be given to providing CCTV cameras in Gerald Griffin Street where

there were no cameras.

 That the Members should visit the Garda CCTV control centre to appraise

themselves on the effectiveness of the system.

 That CCTV should be installed in local communities and the Minister should be

written to requesting funding for same.

The Deputy Chief Executive pointed out that, while the Council operated CCTV cameras

in relation to traffic and community issues, the points raised by the motion were a matter

for the Garda Síochána who could be requested to provide information in this regard or

the matter could be pursued further by the Joint Policing Committee. He indicated that a

visit to the Garda control centre could be organised if required.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District write to the Minister***

***for the Environment enquiring how much motor tax money collected in our***

***District was handed over to Irish Water, and requesting the return of that money to***

***the Council to be spent on the local roads rather than on imposing another***

***austerity charge.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Keller noted the shortfall in government funding for

the Council resulting in reduced services while a considerable investment was being

made in Irish Water and stressed the need for the Members to protect funding for the

Council.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Prendiville pointed out that €400m of road tax---
receipts had been given to Irish Water and the Members should fight to retain this

funding.

Members expressed the view that this was a legitimate issue in light of the amount of

funds that had been paid to unsecured bond holders and also that this was a national

issue.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Loftus

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District registers its full***

***support for the 3,440 one parent families in Limerick City by writing to the Minister***

***for Social Protection urging her to ensure no family is disadvantaged or has their***

***income cut by the changes to the One Parent Family Payment due in July.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Loftus stressed the importance of protecting the most

vulnerable in society and highlighted the challenges of raising a child as a lone parent.

He noted that increasing rents, combined with cuts to fuel allowance and back to school

supports, were putting more people into poverty.

In seconding the motion Councillor Gilligan cited the example of individuals having to

give up work to keep their social welfare benefits.

Members supported the motion and made the following observations in relation to same:

 A considerable percentage of the tenants that had signed up for HAP were

representative of one parent families and, with rent caps already set at too low a

point, it was now proposed to reduce payments to this category.

 There was no childcare scheme in place to assist people get back to work.

 In accordance with recent CSO figures the number of one parent families in

Limerick was 20% higher than the national average and the high cost of raising

children must be acknowledged.

 That the Members come forward with constructive proposals on how to support

childcare and how to help people to support themselves.

On the proposal of Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Hourigan, it was

agreed to suspend standing orders to facilitate the completion of the agenda.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council begin to prepare for the possibility***

***that the Parkway Valley/Horizon Mall planning permission will be rejected by An***

***Bord Pleanala, and put in place plans for alternative social and community uses of***

***that area should that happen.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that a decision from An Bord

Pleanala was due in respect of this site which was now in a derelict condition.

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that, in its present condition, the site was unsightly and

presented health and safety issues.---
**REPLY**:

The Council understands that An Bord Pleanala decision on the Horizon

Mall Appeal is due by 19th March 2015. The

Planning

Authority

has

previously committed to review the retail and commercial zoning in the

Castletroy Local Area Plan at the earliest opportunity. However a review of

the site in question would be premature until such time a decision is made

on the appeal application, and the current planning permissions on the site

expire in August 2016.

Councillor Prendiville suggested that the Council take immediate action in relation to the

site and it was pointed out that, as there is an existing permission on the site, the

Council would have to be prepared to purchase the site to gain control of it before any

suggested works could be carried out.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Paul Keller, John

Loftus and Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick***

***condemns the recent homophobic assault on Roisin Prendergast and Ciara***

***Murphy in Limerick, and sends a letter to them expressing the Metropolitan***

***District's sympathies and solidarity with them, and the Metropolitan District's***

***strong belief that homophobia has no place in our city.***

The Deputy Chief Executive urged the Members to proceed with caution in relation to

any matter that was under investigation by An Garda Síochána and stressed that there

should be public debate on an issue only where the facts were accurate and clear.

On the proposal of Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Daly it was agreed

that the motion should be amended to read as follows :

“That the Metropolitan District of Limerick condemns homophobia in all its forms”

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council investigate the possibility of***

***putting a railing or some preventable measure on the footpath from Mungret***

***Football Club to the village to deter cars and buses from parking on the footpaths.***

It was agreed that this motion should be referred to the Metropolitan Area Forum.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maria Byrne

***I will move*** ***at the next Metropolitan meeting that Limerick City and County Council***

***will provide traffic calming measures at Maigue Avenue, Raheen, Limerick.***

It was agreed that this motion should be referred to the Metropolitan Area Forum.---

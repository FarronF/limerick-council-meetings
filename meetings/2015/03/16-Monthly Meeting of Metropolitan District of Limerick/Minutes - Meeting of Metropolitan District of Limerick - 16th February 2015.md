Members queried as to whether the houses in Wallers Well had been purchased from

NAMA and at what price and the Senior Executive Officer, Home and Social

Development undertook to clarify same and revert to the Members.

The Deputy Chief Executive informed Members that, arising from discussions at

previous meetings and Members’ dissatisfaction with the absence of formal structures to

discuss issues affecting the three separate electoral areas within the Metropolitan

District, it was proposed that, commencing in early March, Members in each electoral

area would now meet with officials to discuss issues, as requested. Members welcomed

the proposal but agreed that their dissatisfaction with the lack of statutory meeting

structures for each electoral area within the Metropolitan District should be brought to

the attention of the Minister who should be requested to amend the relevant legislation

to put these structures in place.

3.

Environment

Team Limerick Clean Up Campaign

The Mayor welcomed Mr. Noel Earlie, representing the J.P. McManus Benevolent Fund,

to the meeting to give an update on Team Limerick Clean Up Campaign. Mr. Earlie

thanked the members for the opportunity to address them and noted that the event, to

be held on the 3rd April, was the brainchild of J.P. McManus and was intended to raise

environmental awareness in the city and county and build on the success of events such

as Tidy Towns and Going for Gold. He pointed out that the event was being run in

partnership with Mr. Binman and that the Council’s Environmental Department, 95FM---
and the Limerick Leader were all adding their support, as was Paul O’Connell who was

acting as Team Leader.

Mr. Earlie noted that, to date, 5004 people had registered for the event and called on the

Members to add their support by endorsing and promoting same.

Members congratulated everyone associated with the Team Limerick Clean Up

Campaign and encouraged individuals and community groups to register for the clean

up. They noted the ongoing challenges faced by the Council in removing litter, chewing

gum and dog litter and called for an increase in on the spot fines, a tax on chewing gum

and for the public to challenge the behaviour of offenders.

Members raised the issue of community groups and residents associations carrying out

similar clean ups in their areas and incurring expense in disposing of the waste

collected. They called on the Council to examine ways in which these groups could be

supported further in this regard.

4.

Community, Leisure and Emergency Services

Circulated, Presentation on Proposed Governance Structure for 69 O’Connell Street.

The Arts Officer, Ms. Sheila Deegan updated Members on the background to 69

O’Connell Street, the range of events that had been held there, the works that had been

undertaken to upgrade the adjacent former Credit Union building and the potential of

these buildings to develop audiences generated by the Limerick City of Culture. She

presented a range of options going forward with “Model B”, as outlined in the circulated

documentation, as the preferred option.

Members acknowledged the contribution 69 O’Connell Street had made to the arts in the

city, its potential to continue to contribute to same and its importance in terms of a bid for

European City of Culture status and the renewal of the city. They noted the large

investment of public finances already made towards this project and stressed the need

for robust governance structures to be put in place representative of elected members,

local business and the arts and called on all stakeholders in the city to add their support

to the project, going forward. Members stressed the need to ensure the project would

not need bail out funding in the future and a query was raised as to whether the

operation of the facility would go to public tender. In response to queries raised by

Members, the Deputy Chief Executive clarified the following :

• Outstanding legal issues relating to 69 O’Connell Street were close to resolution.

• The Arts Council was seen as an important partner in this project and he planned

to meet with same in the immediate future.

• Funding was in place up to the end of March 2015 and an application had been

made for funding beyond that point.

• The memorandum of understanding with the Lime Tree Theatre was due to expire

and he had no concerns with regard to the current governance structure.

The Deputy Chief Executive undertook to revert to the Members with proposals for the

Management Structure for 69 O’Connell Street, based on its viable future, and it was

agreed that a copy of the report that had been commissioned by the Council on the

future use of 69 O’Connell Street would be circulated to Members.---
5.

Economic Development and Planning

(a)

Limerick City & County Council Business & Retail Incentive

Scheme for Vacant Property in Limerick City Centre, Abbeyfeale,

Kilmallock, Newcastle West and Rathkeale

Circulated report on the Limerick City and County Council Business and Retail Incentive

Scheme for Vacant Property from the Director, Economic Development and Planning

dated 10th February and associated application form and guidelines for Business and

Retail Incentives Scheme for Vacant Properties Grant.

Ms. Mary Hayes, Administrative Officer, Economic Development and Planning circulated

and presented via powerpoint, Proposals to Extend Business and Retail Incentives

Scheme from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2016 which included the following :

• Background to benefits and aims of the current Business and Retail Incentives

Scheme.

• Area of application of the scheme and occupancy / vacancy data for current

scheme areas.

• Rationale for maintaining the scheme as is and consultation with other

stakeholders regarding the scheme.

Members thanked Ms. Hayes for her presentation, they broadly welcomed the scheme

and raised the following issues in relation to same :

• The need to include Nicholas Street in the scheme and concerns that the

proposed new footbridge would reduce footfall on Nicholas Street.

• The need to include Davis Street and Parnell Street within the retail element of

the scheme in recognition of the role they play as routes into the city centre for

people arriving from Colbert Station. A view was also expressed that the route

from Colbert Station to King John’s Castle should likewise be included.

• The need for a targeted approach to be taken to resolve the issue of vacant

premises on the Dock Road.

• That supports be put in place for non retail premises that do not have the funds to

carry out necessary refurbishment works.

• That the scheme be extended to locations such as Annacotty and Patrickswell.

• That the retail element of the scheme be expanded to include neighbouring

streets such as Upper William Street.

In response to issues raised by the members, the Senior Planner made the following

points:

• The Mid West Retail Strategy 2009 had identified that Limerick City was

underperforming in relation to higher order retail, with cities such as Cork and

Galway benefiting. The core retail area in Limerick City had been identified and

the existing scheme, combined with a general upturn in the economy, were

contributing to increased footfall in the city centre. Any extension of the scheme

boundary at this point would dilute the potential impact of the scheme, which

should be given an opportunity to achieve its objectives and then extended to

other streets.

• There was scope to raise awareness of the scheme and the retail sector and the---
local media will be engaged with in this regard.

• The proposal, raised by Members, that businesses be supported before they fail

would be looked at as part of a packet of measures across the city.

In response to queries raised by Members, Ms. Mary Hayes clarified the following :

• In relation to retail grants there was a presumption in favour of higher order retail.

• In relation to business grants the criteria was more wide ranging with most

businesses qualifying.

• Part of Arthurs Quay was now included in the retail area due to the increased

level of vacancy.

• The Working Group, set up in conjunction with Retail Excellence Ireland, had

carried out positive work but had not yet issued a report.

On the proposal of Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan, it was

agreed that standing orders would be suspended to allow for the completion of the

agenda.

5(b) **Derelict Sites**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Economic Development and Planning dated February

2015.

Members welcomed the report that had provided them with an update and background

to derelict sites and sought clarity on a number of items in relation to same.

In response the Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development and Planning noted

the following :

• Several legal actions under the Planning legislation had been taken in relation to

the site adjacent to the Milk Market. An action that had been successful in the

District Court in relation to this site had subsequently been overturned by the

Circuit Court.

• A small team of staff was involved with derelict sites allowing for an average of

1.5 days per week of inspections to be carried out.

• The Derelict Sites levy only applied to those properties on the register. Nineteen

sites were invoiced regularly in the Metropolitan District area to a value of

€32,000 and less than €2,000 was received each year in relation to same. Any

outstanding amounts would be recouped when a property was sold.

• Legal action was only taken when all other avenues had been exhausted and

typically, 20 enforcement notices per annum were issued.

• The incidence of anti social behaviour at a site was not sufficient to categorise the

sites as a derelict site.

Members asked to be provided with similar updates on Derelict Sites at regular intervals.

6.

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will ask at the next meeting what progress if any has been made with the derelict***

***site opposite Punch's Hotel and formerly the site of John Moloney Garage, which***---
***has planning permission for a commercial development, and what the current***

***ownership structure is.***

**REPLY**:

This site is in the Derelict Sites Register. There are multiple owners and

contact has been made with the Receiver appointed to act on behalf of the

group who had originally planned on developing the overall site. The

Receiver advised that it can only be sold if all three parties come together

and package it as one site and he has indicated that discussions are

ongoing in this regard. The Council will continue to monitor progress in

this regard.

7.

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will ask at the next meeting as to who is the current owner of the site at the***

***junction of Upper Gerald Griffin Street and Wickham Street, which is totally***

***overgrown and derelict in the heart of our city centre, with a view to totally***

***clearing this site.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council are the owners of this land as part of the

Parnell Street CPO circa 1960. There are a number of properties

adjoining this piece of ground. Any works undertaken to remove the

overgrowth will require a survey to advise if these works will impact on the

adjoining properties. This will be arranged shortly.

The Mayor welcomed residents from Caherdavin to the meeting and it was agreed that

Items 16, 17 and 18 on the agenda, relating to Caherdavin Library, would be taken

together at this point.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council resolve to work in a positive***

***manner with the community centre in Caherdavin to operate a viable library in***

***their building and that a review of this process take place in the Autumn of this***

***year***.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick supports***

***the Caherdavin Residents Association's request to keep the Caherdavin Library***

***open for a 6 month trial. Over that 6 months the library can be housed on the***

***ground floor of the community centre, if needs be. This trial period can give space***

***for the library to develop a clear and important role within the Limerick Library***

***Services, or at least develop with the community proposals for alternative***

***services. At the end of this trial period, a review should take place with the***

***community, and the councillors to take a final decision on this matter.***

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Frankie Daly

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick supports***

***the Caherdavin Residents Association's request to keep the Caherdavin Library***

***open for a 6 month trial. Over that 6 months the library can be housed on the***---
***ground floor of the community centre, to avoid breaching health and safety***

***concerns as expressed by library services. This trial period can give space for the***

***library to develop a clear and important role within the Limerick Library Services,***

***or at least develop with the community proposals for alternative services. At the***

***end of this trial period, a review should take place with the community, and the***

***councillors to take a final decision on this matter.***

The motions were proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor

Gilligan.

In proposing the motions, Councillor Prendiville requested that the Caherdavin

Residents Association be supported in their efforts to keep this library open. He was

critical of how the closure had been handled by the Council and indicated that the

residents were due an apology in relation to same.

In seconding the motions, Councillor Gilligan noted the lack of facilities in the

Caherdavin area and suggested that the Council review same over the coming months

and put in place a viable plan for Caherdavin.

Members made the following additional points in relation to the motions.

• That the footfall in the existing library was low because of its inadequacy and

elderly members should be provided with community bus facilities to bring them

to Watch House Cross.

• That facilities in Caherdavin were inadequate and the Residents Association

should be supported in their efforts in providing facilities at their community centre

to the standard of the St. Munchins Centre.

**REPLY**:

The part-time Library Centre at Caherdavin, which was opened 9½ hours

per week, offered a very limited service to the public. It was located in a

small single room at 2nd floor level in Caherdavin Community Centre. Due

to limited space, it could only carry a very narrow range of stock. It had no

space for IT Services such as Public Internet.

It presented particular challenges in terms of public access. The only

access point to the Library Centre was via a long steep stairs. There was

no separate fire escape or emergency exit. It did not meet current Health

and Safety Standards.

It was not suitable in terms of range of service or accessibility for local

schools and the 400 pupils at both the local boys and girls schools are

served by the Schools Mobile Library Service.

In June 2007, an 8,000sq foot state of the Art Library had opened at Watch

House Cross, with a host of new innovative services e.g. Arts & Crafts

area, Music Laboratory, Language Laboratory, Story time space, PC Suite,

Exhibition Area and Community Rooms. The opening of Watch House

Cross Library has proved hugely successful with over 3,500 members

registered, ongoing PC classes for adults and community rooms booked

out. In addition the Library at Watch House Cross is opened 41 hours per

week over 5 days including 2 late nights, lunchtime and every Saturday.---
It was initially proposed in March 2008 to close Caherdavin part time

Library Centre due to low levels of use and very limited facilities.

However, a period of time was granted to measure the viability of the

service going forward. Over the past 7 years, the level of use by the public

has been extremely low and year on year has continually declined to a

handful of readers. Watch House Cross Library, located 1 mile from

Caherdavin has over 400 registered readerswith a Caherdavin address.

The Granary Library, located 2 miles from Caherdavin has over 270

registered readers with a Caherdavin address. Dooradoyle Library, located

4 miles from Caherdavin has over 110 registered readers with a

Caherdavin address.

The proposed ground floor space in the community centre is less than 800

sq. feet and would not meet the standards required for a modern Library.

In light of the above issues, the part-time Library Centre at Caherdavin was

not fit for purpose and given the fact that there are 4 alternative Library

Services in place namely Watch House Cross, The Granary, Dooradoyle

and a dedicated schools service, it was decided to close Caherdavin part-

time Library Centre on Friday 13th February, 2015.

The Deputy Chief Executive acknowledged the issues that had been raised in relation to

services in Caherdavin and undertook to review the gaps in services and the

requirements of the Caherdavin Community Centre and assist in relation to same.

The City and County Librarian noted that the demand for Library Services in Caherdavin

was being met elsewhere with superb library facilities located one mile away and

schools service also in place.

Councillor Maria Byrne took the Chair at this point in the meeting.

As some members of the public were in attendance in relation to Item 12, it was agreed

to take this item next.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council provide a "Prayer Garden" in the***

***city as a place where people experiencing tragic loss or those who are in despair***

***can come to visit in privacy. With suicide so prevalent in Limerick, this would be***

***a location not only for victims but may indeed provide a sanctuary for those who***

***may be in peril themselves. I feel that a city centre site is crucial, suitable and***

***necessary and suggest the old Graveyard in Michael Street. Once we can secure***

***this or an alternative site, we can see about developing it.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Crowley and seconded by Councillor Lynch.

**REPLY**:

Michael Street graveyard is not in the ownership of Limerick City and

County Council. An assessment of this site or alternative sites can be

undertaken subject to funding made available and consent of the

relevant landowner(s). Any such proposal will have to be assessed to

ascertain if planning permission is required.---
8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately***

***prepare an Urban Renewal Scheme and Plan for the Village of Patrickswell, similar***

***to that recently completed in Mungret, in consultation with the local stakeholders***

***and submits it for planning approval and that the Council allocate or arrange the***

***necessary finance to fund the scheme, having sought contractor tenders.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Lynch highlighted the potential of Patrickswell and

indicated that a commitment had been received from management to carry out works

there.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Collins stressed the need for funding to be made

available for this project as part of a capital programme. He noted the inadequacy of

bus connectivity in Patrickswell and it was agreed that Bus Eireann should be written to

in this regard.

Members supporting the motion noted the benefits of the new cycle track to Patrickswell,

the need to develop the centre of Patrickswell and also the need to provide parking

facilities. It was suggested that local councillors should meet with residents and officials

in relation to the above and draw up a list of items in need of attention.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that the grass cutting schedules for the 3 electoral***

***areas of the Metropolitan District of Limerick be presented to Members before the***

***season begins so that Members can ensure the schedule is effective.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Butler pointed out that he had an issue with the

regularity and quality of the grass cutting service, with cut grass being deposited on the

adjacent roads and grass not being cut on a two week cycle.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Collins requested that, in relation to the Metropolitan

District, a schedule of areas cut by the Council and those cut by contractors be provided.

He also sought details of grants paid to communities to cut grass and details of who was

responsible for the grass cutting of each estate and he highlighted the need to let

communities know that grants were available.

Members supported the motion and pointed out the need for grass cutting to be

monitored and penalties imposed on contractors if work is not carried out properly.

**REPLY**:

The Council’s grass cutting contract is currently out to tender. Tenders will

be returned and analysed over the coming weeks and the Council expects

to commence grass cutting in late March / early April.

Grass cutting has not been tendered on the basis of the electoral areas of

the Metropolitan District and tenderers are not required to produce any

such schedule.

It is a requirement of the grass cutting contract that all areas will be cut

once every two weeks.---
10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council put a yellow box junction at the***

***entrance of The Grange, Raheen and Church Road entering the R510 to allow***

***local traffic drive on to this busy road safely.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Collins.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Butler noted that the pedestrian crossing at this

location was being blocked by traffic and a yellow box would prevent same.

**REPLY**:

The R510 is a busy regional road, particularly at school opening and

closing times. During these peak times it can be difficult for traffic trying to

exit from The Grange, particularly if they wish to turn right to get onto the

main road.

The Council is in agreement with the proposal for a Yellow Box at this

location and will consult with An Garda Siochana in this regard. If a

favourable response is received then arrangements will be made to have

Traffic Sign No. RRM 020 (Yellow Box) placed at the entrance to The

Grange.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately***

***tackle all the hedging issues on the North Circular Road and other areas***

***throughout the North Side. Many of the hedges are forcing pedestrians to walk on***

***the roadways and if these cannot be addressed directly, because they are on***

***private property, the appropriate enforcement should be issued to the owners to***

***carry out the works.***

***In addition, there are many trees that need to be removed due to damage and also***

***height issues in many places, photographs of such trees can be provided. There***

***is a huge decline in local amenity areas and the Council should draw up and***

***implement an immediate action plan to improve the overall appearance of these***

***areas.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Crowley highlighted the need to review the issue of

trees and hedges overgrowing boundaries on the North Circular Road and impose

sanctions against property owners who do not maintain their boundaries. He also

stressed the need for any trees that were a danger to the public to be made safe.

Councillor Hourigan indicated that he agreed with the sentiments of the motion but

stressed the extent to which trees enhanced the area and the need to deal only with

trees that were a danger to the public.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council have a policy of writing to property

owners in relation to hedges that protrude onto footpaths to request that

they cut back any hedging that causes a health and safety issue. We will

continue to communicate with property owners and take enforcement

measures as necessary.---
Any dangerous trees that are notified to Limerick City and County Council

will be inspected and dealt with appropriately.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Senior Engineer pointed out that there

was no specific fund for tree cutting which, due to health and safety considerations,

could be an expensive operation. He noted that the maintenance of hedges was not just

an urban issue and that the Council carried out an advertising campaign each year to

remind landowners of their obligations. Individual cases were written to under the

Roads legislation and the majority engage positively with the Council.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District arrange to meet***

***with the management of Shannon Foynes Port Company with a view to***

***addressing the current unsightly build up of scrap metal in Limerick Docks which***

***is a total eyesore for the local community, especially visitors staying in the local***

***hotel, and agree a new strategy for dealing with this type of material.***

As there was no proposer for this motion, it was deferred to the next meeting in

accordance with Standing Orders.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council remove, or have removed, the***

***rubbish dump which lies between the Castle Wall and the river.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Gilligan noted the involvement of Waterways Ireland

in this area and suggested that an official from the Council should be appointed to deal

with Waterways Ireland.

Councillor Loftus proposed that the motion be amended to include the removal of all

debris visible between the three bridges at low tide.

**REPLY**:

This area, adjacent to the river bank, is in the care of Waterways Ireland.

The Council will liaise with them in relation to cleaning up this area.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council hold an ‘Oíche Gaeilge’ or ‘Irish***

***Language Night’ in City Hall between 1st and 16th March 2015 as part of***

***Seachtain na Gaeilge with refreshments and food provided for anyone who***

***wishes to come to the event to speak in Irish with other Irish speakers and that a***

***similar event be held annually during Seachtain na Gaeilge. The event should be***

***open to all, whether fluent speakers or beginners, wishing to improve their Irish.***

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh stressed the importance of Irish Language

Week in promoting the Irish language and the need to continue the promotion of the

language in conjunction with our bid for European City of Culture status.---
The motion was seconded by Councillor Lynch.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is in the process of organising an ‘Oiche

Gaeilge’ which will be held in Merchant’s Quay. A tentative date for this

event is Thursday 12th March 2015. The date and time will be confirmed to

all Elected Members in due course.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Jerry O’Dea

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District that Limerick City and***

***County Council address**the need for enhanced traffic calming measures at***

***Roxboro and Donoughmore National Schools.***

As there was no proposer for this motion, it was deferred to the next meeting in

accordance with Standing Orders.

20.

Correspondence

Members noted the poor level of response received in many instances to Notices of

Motion forwarded to Government Departments. In particular, issues were raised with

regard to replies received in relation to caps on rent supplement and leaks at water

meters and it was requested that the correspondence in these instances be followed up

with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Irish

Water, respectively.

This concluded the Meeting.

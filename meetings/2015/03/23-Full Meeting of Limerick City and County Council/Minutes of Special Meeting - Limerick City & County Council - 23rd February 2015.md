Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. They

respected amongst his electorate, he had served two terms as Mayor of

pointed out by Members that he had a deep pride in being from Limerick and

in his Labour heritage.

It was said that Frank Prendergast was born into a family of bakers and that he

Labour Movement and through both the ITGWU and the Labour Party, he

fought to improve the living and working conditions of ordinary people across

the City. He had served all the people of Limerick with tenacity and dedication.

He was a passionate believer of education and was a fluent Gaeilgeoir. He was

a regular contributor to Irish language programmes and publications. He was

extremely proud of the development of Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, where he was

Chairman of the Board. Members acknowledged that this was a role that he

was particularly proud of and one that he had carried out with great energy. It

was stated that one of the greatest accolades he could have had was having

the memorial library named after him.

He was described as a fantastic ambassador and advocate for Limerick all his

life and particularly so during his two terms of Mayor in 1977/1978 and

1984/1985. He was a pillar of the community who fought hard for issues and

The Chief Executive paid tribute to Frank Prendergast on his own behalf and on

behalf of the Staff and extended sincere sympathy to his wife Mary, family,

community and friends. He said he had the pleasure of serving with him in the

Council. He went on to say that the tributes were well deserved and perfectly

described Frank Prendergast. As a Councillor, he had been extraordinarily

supportive and had always been generous with his time, knowledge and

experience. He had an unwavering passion and belief in Local Government

and the people it served. He concluded by saying that he was an inspiration to

all and would be sadly missed.

Some Members were of the view that it would be a fitting tribute to Frank

Prendergast if those Members who wanted to wear the old City Council

Ceremonial Robes to his funeral could do so if they wished.

At the suggestion of the Mayor, it was agreed to take a short adjournment to

allow the Party Leaders to discuss the matter with the Executive.

Upon resumption, it was noted that it had been agreed that, on this occasion,

those Members who wished to wear the Robes to the funeral could do so.

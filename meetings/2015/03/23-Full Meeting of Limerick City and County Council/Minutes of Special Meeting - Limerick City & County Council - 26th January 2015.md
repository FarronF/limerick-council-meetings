Members as follows:

“We, the undersigned, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, call a Special

Meeting of Limerick City and County Council to discuss the potential

impact to the Limerick and Mid-West Region of a takeover of Aer Lingus

by International Airlines Group (IAG) given the strategic and balanced

regional development importance of maintaining the Shannon/Heahtrow

landing slots.”

Councillor Collins (J), in proposing the Motion on behalf of his party, put

forward the following amended Motion.

“That, Limerick City and County Council call on Minister Paschal

Donohoe to use the State’s 25% shareholding to block any International

Airlines Group (IAG) outright purchase. Ireland’s strategic national

interests must be protected and that will not be done through a quick

fire sale, which relinquishes valuable slots at Heathrow, risks up to

1,000 jobs and gives away forever an important strategic asset.”

Councillor Collins (J), in proposing the amended Motion, stated that his party

was calling on the Minister for Transport to rule out any sale of the

Government’s stake in Aer Lingus in order to protect Ireland’s strategic

national interests. He said the threat to the valuable Heathrow slots could see

Ireland’s access to international destinations severely curtailed, as many of

the routes to Asia, America and Australia were serviced through the airport.

The continuation of these slots was of major strategic interest as Ireland was

highly dependent on exports and tourism and access to international

destinations was a major enabler in facilitating inward investment, as well as

boosting tourism figures. He added that not only were the Heathrow links

under threat if a sale proceeded, but there were also major concerns about

possible job losses.

The amended Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.

Councillor Leddin, on behalf of his party, proposed an amendment to the

Motion as follows:

“That, Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister for

Transport to block the sale of Aer Lingus unless a legal guarantee is

given to protect connectivity links and Heathrow slots.”

In proposing the amendment, Councillor Leddin stated that his party was

concerned regarding connectivity through Shannon Airport and the potential

negative economic impact to businesses if there was a loss of air routes. He

added that connectivity to Heathrow was a prerequisite to doing business in

the global economy.

The amendment was seconded by Councillor Secas.

Councillor Prendiville, on behalf of his party, stated that they supported the

original Motion put forward by Fianna Fáil and that they were totally opposed

to the sale of Aer Lingus.

Councillor Sheahan (J), on behalf of his party, proposed an amendment to the

Motion as follows:

“That, Limerick City and County Council call on the Government to use

its 25% share to block the sale of Aer Lingus unless current connectivity

and Heahtrow slots to London are 100% legally protected.”

Councillor Sheahan (J), in proposing the amended Motion, stated that his

party did not support the sale of Aer Lingus unless the Heathrow slots to

London were legally protected. He stressed the need to protect Shannon and

highlighted the growth and positive work that had taken place at Shannon

Airport since going independent. He expressed the fear that job creation and

retention would be severely hampered in the Mid-West Region if the lucrative

links between Shannon and London Heathrow were lost. He added that any

potential reduction in connectivity would have a detrimental impact, not only

on foreign owned firms who operated here, but on our indigenous firms as

they sought to expand into new markets internationally.

The amended Motion was seconded by Councillor Byrne.

Councillor Quinlivan, on behalf of his party, stressed that the Shannon-

Heathrow route was an essential part of the infrastructure for maintaining the

economic wellbeing of the entire Mid-West and Western Region. He

highlighted that his party was not only concerned about potential job losses,

but they also had a fear that, if the Heathrow connection was lost, the

Shannon Region would become isolated and that this would have a huge

impact on the Region’s ability to attract investment and tourism.

At this point, the Mayor suggested a short adjournment and this was agreed.

He asked the Party Leaders to review the various Motions put forward at the

Meeting with a view to agreeing a single Motion which could be sent from the

Council to the Government on the matter.

On resumption of the Meeting, the following Motion, which was proposed by

Councillor Collins (J) and seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), was

unanimously agreed:

“That, Limerick City and County Council call on Minister Paschal

Donohoe not to sell the State’s 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus in order

to protect Ireland’s valuable slots at Heathrow and to protect the 1,000

jobs reported to be at risk.”

It was also agreed that this Motion would replace the previous Motion and

amendments raised earlier in the Meeting.

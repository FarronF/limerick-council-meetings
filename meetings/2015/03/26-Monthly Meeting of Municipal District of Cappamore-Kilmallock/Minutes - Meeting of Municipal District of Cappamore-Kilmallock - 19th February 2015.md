4. Economic Development and Planning

Limerick City & County Co il Business & Retail Incentive Scheme

for Vacant Property in Limerick City Centre, Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock,
Newcastle West and Rathkeale

Circulated report on the Limerick City and County Council Business and Retail
Incentive Scheme for Vacant Property from the Director, Economic Development and
Planning dated 10” February, 2015 and associated application form and guidelines
for Business and Retail Incentives Scheme for Vacant Properties Grant.

Ms. Mary Hayes, Administrative Officer, Economic Development and Planning
presented via PowerPoint Proposal to Extend Business and Retail Incentive Scheme
from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2016.

Ms. Mary Hayes indicated that there was a proposal to extend the existing Limerick
City and County Council Business and Retail Incentive Scheme for Vacant Property
until December, 2016. It was noted that the scheme offers incentives for the
occupation of vacant retail and business units in city and town centres through the
provision of grant aid in designated areas. These areas include Limerick City
Centre, Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock, Newcastle West and Rathkeale. Under the scheme
new businesses receive grant relief over two years for occupation of vacant
premises with higher order retail type uses and business uses. Higher order retail
use types can include fashion outlets — both multiple and independent stores,
‘lifestyle stores’, flagship stores, niche and specialist retailers such as home
furnishings, beauty products, jewellery and books. The grant relief provided for the
certified fit-out costs of vacant premises up to the value of 50% of commercial rates
payable in the first year of operation and 25% in the second year.

It was noted that the number of vacant retail properties in Kilmallock stood at 36%,
this compared to 9% in Newcastle West, 18% in both Abbeyfeale and Rathkeale and
21% in Limerick City Centre.

Members indicated that they welcomed any initiative which created jobs, however,
stated that the scheme should be extended to include towns like Kilfinane, Bruff,
Hospital and Cappamore which also needed support. Members expressed concern
that existing businesses were not benefiting from this initiative.

The Administrative Officer, Economic Development and Planning indicated that it
was proposed to maintain the scheme in the current areas as significant vacancy still
remained in those areas. She added that Limerick City and County Council did not
have the financial resources to extend the scheme and any extension of the scheme
would dilute the potential impact of the scheme which should be given an opportunity
to achieve its objectives and then extend to other areas.

dealt with:

! will ask at the next Meeting if community groups like Tidy Towns and
Community Councils can remove public bins, where not needed, into storage
with the permission of the Council and only put them out again if/when
needed.

REPLY:

The former Co-Op Store in Herbertstown is registered in the name of a
company called Mansard Ltd and was placed on the Derelict Sites
Register in October 2009. Subsequently the Council was successful in
securing a conviction against the owners of the property in the District
Court for non compliance with an enforcement notice under the Derelict
Sites Act, 1990.

In March 2012, the Council carried out works, including safety works,
on the building and invoiced the owners for the cost of these works.
These costs and the Derelict Sites Levy remain outstanding in relation
to this property.

The Council will continue to pursue the owners of this property with a
view to finalising this matter.

ee Question submitted by Councillor O’ Donnell

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on proposals by Limerick City &
County Council for the use of its premises at Crawford Street Bruff.

REPLY:

The Council does not currently have a definitive use for the building.
However, the building will be inspected with a view to deciding on
potential future use as well as obtaining a structural report to get an
indication of the costs involved in bringing the building back to a viable
use.

In the meantime the Council will examine the possibility of improving
the appearance of the building in the short-term.

8. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

| will ask at the next Meeting as to the correct procedure for members making
representations for Social Housing.

REPLY:

Councillors are encouraged to make their representations via
Customer Services which allows for a central log of their
representations.

Stephen Keary at the February Meeting of Adare-Rathkeale District

NOTICES OF MOTION

As Items 9 and 12 were related, it was agreed that both would be taken together.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sheehy

! will move at the next Meeting that the junctions at both sides of L8641 in
Kilgarriff be addressed immediately with stop signs and lining.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy adding that this was a dangerous
junction with a pre-school in close proximity. The Motion was seconded by
Councillor Donegan.

REPLY: The Council will review the condition of the signing and lining in the
area shortly, and if required replace or renew. Stop signs are only
appropriate where a minor road joins a major road, which is not the
case here.

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City & County Council consider
road improvements at the junction at Kilgarriff, Ballylanders.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Donegan and seconded by Councillor
Sheehy.

was needed at this junction.

REPLY: The Council will review the junctions as well as the condition of the
drainage in the area shortly, and upgrade it where appropriate.

10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O’Donnell

In proposing the Motion Councillor O'Donnell indicated that the scheme is not
available to community groups adding that Limerick City and County Council should
be flexible and extend the scheme.

REPLY:

The grant scheme for the Maintenance of open spaces in Housing
Developments is primarily to aid resident associations.

Each application is considered on an individual basis, having regard to
the level of finance available and relevant factors such as the acreage
and numbers of houses served by the open spaces, etc.

In 2014 Limerick City and County Council funded approx 80 groups
and the scheme for 2015 is currently being advertised and is open for
applications.

Any proposals to extend the scope of the current scheme will have to
have regard to the implications for those groups who currently benefit
from the scheme.

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

| will move at the next Meeting that improvement works be carried out in
Caherconlish at the junction at Lynch's corner on the R513.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teefy and seconded by Councillor Mitchell.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teefy indicated that this was a very busy and
dangerous junction adding the difficulty children are experiencing crossing the road.

REPLY:

The issue is to construct this junction to ensure the safety of
Pedestrians and motorists. However works, both design and
construction, cannot proceed until a funding source can be identified.

The suite of works required on the approaches to this junction from
Cois Rioga and High Street include:

Cois Rioga side; Acquire land to widen bridge near Lynch's pub. The
additional road width will allow the construction of a footpath and public
lighting from Cois Rioga estate to Lynch's pub at the junction.

High Street side; Construct footpath, build out and pedestrian crossing
on R513 at junction.

In the past the grant stream used for works of this nature was ‘Specific
Improvement Grant’ from the Department of Transport. Due to the


---

recent recession this grant stream has stopped and has not been
replaced.

It was agreed to hold the next Monthly Meeting on Thursday, 26th March, 2015 at
3 pm and that the Workshop on the General Municipal Allocation (GMA) take place
on Wednesday, 4th March, 2015 at 3 p.m.

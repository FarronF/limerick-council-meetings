Members regarding representations for Social Housing be made available at District

REPLY: A Meeting will be arranged with the Councillors who have been nominated to
the Home and Social Development SPC over the next few weeks to discuss

and agree a new protocol.

Members reiterated the need to formulate policy on this issue and indicated that the Home
and Social Development SPC should be notified to formulate procedures.

13. Question submitted by Councillor Kevin Sheahan

1 will ask at the next Meeting when and why Limerick City and County Council
discontinued the practice of issuing a licence to the Refuse Collectors for the
purpose of collecting refuse in a recognised plastic bag from apartments.

REPLY: The Waste Byelaws adopted in 2011 included the requirement that waste
should be presented in wheeled bins. The reasoning behind this approach is
to avoid residual waste and dry recyclable waste being placed on the
street/road in bags. These bags could split, be left open or interfered with by
animals resulting in littering issues.

It is also essential for enforcement purposes to be in a position to identify the
owner of waste presented and for the waste collector to provide a pay by
weight system. Wheeled bins are electronically chipped and the
owner/customer is therefore readily identifiable.

The Council has initiated a move to Wheeled Bins over the last number of
years and to have a functioning segregated collection system at the
kerbside.

This process will be further reinforced by new Household Waste Regulations
to be implemented in 2015 requiring all separate waste elements to be
weighed. A bin system will be required for the operation of such regulations.

Waste Collectors must abide by the Presentation of Waste Byelaws and as a
result have been phasing out their respective bag collections. Mr Binman
was the last Collector to do so and became compliant last autumn.

The current Byelaws do allow for exceptions provided written approval is
given by the Council. No exceptions have been granted outside of the City.
There are currently in operation less than 20 historic exceptions formerly
allowed by the City Council in response to specific individual circumstances.
These exceptions are under review with a view to eliminating them for the
reasons as set out above.

Members indicated that residents of apartments often do not have access to a yard to
store refuse bins. On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O'Brien
it was agreed that the Environment Section should be requested to apply the same rules in
the City and County in relation to this item.

NOTICES OF MOTION

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Emmett O’Brien

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council install traffic
route lighting in the vicinity of the Kilcornan primary school and entrance to the Ger
McDonnell all-weather playing facility/Kilcornan Community Centre together with
enhanced traffic calming/safety measures at this location.

Councillor O'Brien, in proposing the Motion, stated that he had received a lot of
representations on this issue and added that it was potentially a road traffic issue and
traffic route lighting can alert motorists to the National School and large sports facility in

the vicinity.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan and following a discussion the Motion
was extended to include the provision of a footpath at the above location.

REPLY: If the Motion is agreed, a letter requesting funding for the above works shall
be issued to the National Roads Authority without delay.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Emmett O’Brien

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council employ or
contract the services of a parking attendant for Adare Village to prevent double
parking on Station Road, the Blackabbey Road and at the roundabout adjacent to
Lena’s Public House.

Councillor O'Brien, in proposing the Motion, stated that traffic was a serious problem in
Adare and double parking was compounding the situation. He added that preventing
double parking was down to enforcement and suggested the Council consider hiring a
parking attendant to alleviate the problem.

Members were divided on the benefits of a parking attendant and indicated that
enforcement was ultimately a Garda issue.

It was agreed that the Superintendent be invited to the next Meeting to discuss issues of
parking in Adare and traffic safety issues on the N20 and N21.

9

REPLY: There is currently no funding available to contract out or employ parking
attendant services for Adare village. The enforcement of parking there is a
matter for An Garda Siochana and we will bring this matter to their attention.

Councillor O'Donoghue indicated that 3,2,1 signs were removed on the road heading to
Croom from Cork and it was noted that the National Roads Authority had indicated that

3,2,1 signs only apply to dual carriageways.

Councillor Sheahan queried the type of material being used to fill in potholes indicating
that the material is being washed away. He asked for a report on the quality of the
materials being used by the Council and its cost price.

Councillor Sheahan said that pedestrian crossings should be provided at every school in
the electoral area and requested that surveys be carried out in this regard and results
made available.

Members queried the use of the new rubber-pad ramps and expressed the view that
tarmac ramps were more efficient in reducing speed than the rubber-pad ramps and asked
that a survey be conducted into the effectiveness of rubber-pad ramps and costings of

same.

Councillor Sheahan raised the problem of horses being fed in a house on the Churchview
Estate in Askeaton where the stairs was removed and the house vandalised. He
requested that a report to be prepared on the condition of the housing estate.

Councillor Scanlan welcomed representatives from Tournafulla Sustainable Living

Community and outlined the procedure for the Deputation. The Deputation consisted of

Helen Broderick (Chairperson), Lil Lenihan and Alison Rae.

Ms. Broderick gave a presentation outlining what the organisation was hoping to

achieve within the community by developing a cooperative shop/café, community hub

and enterprise centre. She stated the aim was to generate employment, encourage

local enterprise and halt the decline of the village.

Ms. Broderick stated that funding was required for this project and it was hoped that

Limerick City and County Council would consider funding through the General Municipal

Allocation. Their application for funding was in the amount of €25,000.

Members thanked the delegation for their excellent presentation and the delegation then

withdrew from the meeting.

Councillor Collins proposed allocating €25,000 to Tournafulla Sustainable Living

Community. This was seconded by Councillor Foley.

Following further discussion, Members proposed that before making any decision on

allocations, a Special Meeting would be held to discuss allocations from the General

Municipal Allocation and requested that the Head of Finance, Motor Tax and ICT attend

this Meeting.

Councillor Collins proposed that, in the meantime, Tournafulla Sustainable Living

Community be contacted updating them on the present position. This was seconded by

Councillor Foley.

Discuss Issues with Superintendent, Newcastle West

Councillor Scanlan welcomed Superintendant O’Connor to the meeting.

The Superintendent outlined the decline in crime in the locality for November and

Members. Superintendant O’Connor provided an update on the drug issue which had

been discussed at the previous Meeting.

The issue of boy racers in Abbeyfeale and, in particular, on Christmas Day was raised

and the Superintendent advised that the Gardaí had attended and investigated this

incident. He added that not much could be done if people were not forthcoming in

making formal complaints.

The Members commended Superintendent O’Connor and the Gardaí for their good

work taking into account staff shortages and closure of rural stations.

All Members extended their best wishes to Garda Brian Hanrahan who was injured in a

shooting incident in New Orleans and wished him a speedy recovery.

It was noted that a new Garda Station was planned for Newcastle West and that a site

had been identified.

The opening hours of Abbeyfeale Garda Station were discussed and Members asked if

Gardaí was a problem and that he had applied to Templemore for additional staff from

the 300 new recruits that were there at present.

QUESTIONS

6.

Question submitted by Councillor Liam Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the road can be re-lined at the Cellar Bar junction,***

***Abbeyfeale, on the N21.***

**REPLY:** This work will be carried out as soon as possible within the next few weeks.

7.

Questions submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will ask at the next Meeting if companies that plant trees on private lands can be***

***contacted by the Council to cut them back where they protrude onto public***

***roadways, in particular at Glenastar, Ardagh.***

**REPLY:**

The Roads Act, 1993, obliges landowners and occupiers of land to take all

reasonable care to ensure that the trees, ditches, hedges and other

vegetation growing on their land are not or could not become a danger to

people using or working on a public road. As such, the onus is placed on

landowners/occupiers of land to keep their hedges cut.

The Wildlife Act, 1976, prohibits hedgecutting between 1st March and 31st

August each year. Therefore, hedgecutting works should be undertaken

as soon as possible and, in any event, not later than end February.

Limerick City and County Council will arrange a letter to be sent to the

landowners at the above location as soon as possible.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will ask at the next Meeting if flooding issues at Camas and Clounsherrick can***

***be resolved between the Council and the Office of Public Works to prevent further***

***flooding of residents**’*** ***properties.***

**REPLY:**

The flooding in this area is predominantly related to drains within private

lands not being maintained and kept open. Newcastle West Roads

Engineer intends to arrange a site meeting with the landowners involved

on site in order to advise them of their duties under the Roads Act,1993.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor F. Foley

***I will ask at the next Meeting if there has been a response from the National***

***Roads Authority regarding the linking up of the crash barrier at Barnagh.***

**REPLY:** The safety barriers on the N21 Killarney Pole to Barnagh Scheme were

provided in accordance with the National Roads Authority’s Design

Standards. The scheme, on completion, was subject to Safety Audit and all
---
5

recommendations were incorporated.

Phase II of the Barnagh Scheme is about to commence and the issue of

additional barrier can be reviewed during construction. However, as the

current scheme complies with all national safety requirements, it is unlikely

that the NRA would sanction expenditure for the additional barrier requested.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor F. Foley

***I will ask at the next Meeting what is the current position regarding a traffic plan***

***at the entrance to Breen’s house at*** ***Barnagh.***

**REPLY:**

The National Roads Authority has, for 2015, sanctioned grants for pavement

strengthening works on the N21 at Ballumurragh East, Barnagh. The

difficulties experienced by right-turning traffic adjacent to Breen’s house will

be examined and dealt with as part of these pavement works.

NOTICES OF MOTION

11.  Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council will revert back to the system of***

***notifying Councillors of housing allocations in each Electoral Area.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that the old system of notifying

Members when a house was allocated had worked very well and asked for this system

to be reinstated.

Councillor Sheahan seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

Councillors have been previously advised of the Data Protection issues

around the former County Council system of notification of housing

allocations. The proposed system is that District Councillors will be

advised of all houses allocated within their District. Where a Councillor

has made representations on behalf of a successful applicant, that

Councillor will be advised of the particular allocation. This is within the

spirit of the Data Protection Act.

Members asked for the Director of Home and Social Development to be invited to the

next Meeting of the Municipal District.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that an assessment be carried out on the bridge***

***over the White River at Glensharrold, Carrigkerry. It is old, in poor condition and***

***a safety hazard for users.***

**`**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins stated that the bridge had become a Health

and Safety issue.

Councillor Sheahan seconded the Motion.

Councillor Scanlan enquired if Coillte could be asked to contribute as they also used the

river crossing.

The Director stated that the bridge and road servicing the houses and forestry was

private property and the Council was not responsible for the repair of the bridge.

**REPLY:**

The information available on the existing Road Schedule is indicating that

the public road stops short of the White River and therefore the

Glensharrold Bridge is a structure that would not fall under the remit of

the Council as it is located on a private road.

To confirm this, the Travel & Transportation Section will survey the road

to ensure that this information is fully accurate. In the interim, Travel &

Transportation will be issuing a Tender shortly for the repair of other

structures around the county that have been prioritised for works. A

survey

and

assessment

of

the

Glensharrold

Bridge

can

be

accommodated into this Tender. Following this assessment, the liability

for its repair would have to be reviewed.

Deputation from Mountcollins Development Association

Councillor Foley indicated that a request to receive a Deputation had been received

from Mountcollins Development Association. On the proposal of Councillor Foley and

seconded by Councillor Collins, it was agreed to receive a Deputation from Mountcollins

Development Association at the April Meeting to be held on 1st April, 2015.

The Members were reminded that the next Meeting would be held on Wednesday, 4th

March, 2015, at Community Hall in Castletown Conyers, Co. Limerick, at 10.a.m.

This concluded the Meeting.

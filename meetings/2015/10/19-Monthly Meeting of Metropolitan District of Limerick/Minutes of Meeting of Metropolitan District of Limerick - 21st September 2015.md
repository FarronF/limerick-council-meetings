PRESENT IN THE CHAIR:

Councillor Jerry O’Dea, Mayor

MEMBERS PRESENT:

Councillors Butler, Byrne, Collins, Gilligan, Hourigan, Hurley, Keller, Leddin, Loftus,

Environment and Water (Mr. K. Lehane), Senior Executive Officer, Home and Social

Development (Ms. P. Liddy), Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development and

Planning (Mr. P. Fitzgerald), Administrative Officer, Economic Development and Planning

(Mr. T. O’Callaghan).

Apologies for their inability to attend had been received from Councillors Clifford,

Crowley and Daly.

At the outset it was noted that, on the proposal of Councillor Byrne, seconded by

Councillor Collins, standing orders had been suspended at 9.45 a.m. to facilitate

discussion on a presentation received from Change Management that had commenced

at 9.30 a.m.

A silence was observed at the start of the meeting in memory of Veronica O’Connor,

Councillor O’Hanlon’s sister, who had died recently. Councillor O’Hanlon thanked

Councillors and staff for their support over the past days.

It was agreed that item 4 would be taken first to facilitate Mr. Gearoid Prendergast from

the Mid West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum (MWRDAF) attend a meeting

elsewhere. The Mayor welcomed Mr. Prendergast to the meeting.

Mr. Prendergast gave a powerpoint presentation which included:

 Membership and Terms of Reference of the MWRDAF.

 MWRDAF supported actions including family support, prevention and community

grants.

 Overall strategic objectives of the National Drugs Strategy 2009 – 2016.

 The changing face of substance misuse and examples of substance misuse related

issues.

 Details of the NACD Drug Prevalence Survey 2010 / 11.

 Emerging issues.
---

Members thanked Mr. Prendergast for his presentation and the following points were

made by Members in relation to this item:

 The Gardai and CAB should be provided with more resources to tackle drug dealers

and minimum sentencing for drug dealing should be introduced.

 Emphasis should be put on prevention through interaction with schools and

community groups.

 Cannabis is a gateway drug and there is no national campaign to highlight the

consequences of its use.

 The punishment model for drug users is not working, users need support rather than

being put in jail where the problem worsens. Addiction should be treated as a health

issue.

 Consideration should be given to requesting Mr. Prendergast to give a similar

presentation to the Joint Policing Committee.

In response to issues raised by Members Mr. Prendergast clarified the following:

 There was insufficient justification to support the appointment of a Drug Liaison

Midwife in Limerick. Broader womens’ services would however be developed.

 The MWRDAF continues to work closely with the Gardai but the proceeds of CAB did

not go back into the community and any help the Metropolitan District could give to

address this issue would be appreciated.

 A change in approach and attitudes to substance misuse should be considered,

including decriminalisation. Portugal, which had similar issues to Ireland, introduced

a new approach which had brought about significant improvements.

 Drug related deaths in the Mid West had decreased and there was now medication

that could assist in preventing overdose.

 Alcohol abuse was a highly complex issue and there was a need to target high risk

groups.

 The issue of substance misuse was under the remit of a Junior Minister and was

previously associated with a full Minister. In addition, no elected Council

representative was on the MWRDAF to represent the Council as Councillor Quinlivan

was there as a community representative.

Members thanked Ms. Hayes for her presentation and the following items were raised by

Members during discussion:

 Concern was expressed with regard to the safety of people crossing O’Connell Street

directly from Cruises Street. Views were expressed that a formal pedestrian crossing

should be put in place and also that a barrier be erected to prevent crossing at this

point.

 That the history of the area and in particular Cruises Hotel be used to animate

Cruises Street and its adjacent lanes.

 That increased pedestrianisation of the city is needed and actions to encourage

shops to remain open in the evenings should be explored.

 The views of the public should be sought in relation to this project along with the

views of students, and those with expertise in this area, in the local third level

institutions.

 The project should be expanded to other parts of the city.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Administrative Officer, Economic

Development and Planning clarified the following:

 The crossing being used by pedestrians from the end of Cruises Street across to

Penneys would be looked at in more detail.

 Consideration was being given to leaving more kiosks in place and this might assist

in encouraging evening trade.

 The Council was not seeking any contribution from adjacent businesses on foot of

the animation works.

 Consideration would be given to the use and quality control of live music, local bands

and buskers.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh

***I will ask at the next meeting when is Cluid Housing Association expected to***

***complete works on the buildings adjacent to Colbert Station and when is it***

***expected that people will be housed in this project?***

**REPLY**:

It is anticipated that, subject to legal title transfer and completion of

competitive tender process, works should be complete and houses ready

for occupation by Quarter 4, 2016.

7.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh

***I will ask at the next meeting what is the current situation with Rathbane Golf***

***Course, and do the Council intend on promoting and funding the Golf Club for the***

***foreseeable future?***

**REPLY:**

Rathbane Golf Course is an 18 hole municipal golf course situated
---
5

adjacent to Southill and Mount St. Oliver cemetery in Limerick. The course

hosts Rathbane Golf Club, and also provides golfing opportunities to

annual and pay-as-you-go clients, who are not members of Rathbane Golf

Club.

In 2003 Limerick City Council entered into a contract for the operation and

management of the course for a 5 year period with an option to extend for

an additional 5 years. The latter option was exercised in 2008 and the

contract continued until 2013.

Between 2013 and March 2015 the Council undertook two tendering

processes under the open procurement procedure with a view to engaging

an operator for the course. Neither tender engendered a large amount of

tender submissions, and neither resulted in a suitable candidate being

appointed to operate the facility, and as a result the incumbent operator

has been retained on a month by month basis.

The Council has recently tendered for the operation and management of

the course under the negotiated procurement procedure, which allows for

an element of flexibility in negotiating the terms and conditions of any

contract. It is anticipated that the negotiated procedure will generate a

higher level of interest from operators than has previously been achieved.

There are 3 phases to the negotiated procedure: a) identification of

suitable qualified tenderers; b) an invitation to tender to number of qualified

tenderers; c) a negotiation process to agree terms and conditions of any

contract. The deadline for receipt of pre-qualification questionnaires

(Phase 1) is 18 September, 2015, with tender documents due to issue to

qualified candidates thereafter.

A key requirement for any incoming operator will be to promote and market

the Course and to increase membership and usage of the Course, thereby

generating income to re-invest in the upkeep of the facility.

The Home and Community, Culture and Sport Directorate will seek an

adequate operational budget for Rathbane Golf Course as part of the

annual budgetary process for 2016 and in subsequent years. In addition,

funding will be sought as part of the Council’s Multi-Annual Capital

Programme to undertake upgrade works to the course and clubhouse.

Where possible, advantage will be taken of exchequer grant funding e.g.

Sports Capital Grants to assist with upgrade works on the course.

Question submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

***I will ask at the next meeting if a permission/licence was granted by the Local***

***Authority to remove, dispose of or store hazardous goods i.e. asbestos in the***

***vicinity of the Dock Road, Limerick.***

**REPLY:**

No authorisations have been issued by Limerick City and County Council

in this regard.

The relevant authorisations for the movement of hazardous waste can only

be issued to the relevant authorised waste collectors by the National TFS

Office (Trans Frontier Shipments). This is under the remit of Dublin City

Council.

The EPA is the relevant authority for the issue of waste licences which

would cover the storage of hazardous waste.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor Jerry O’Dea

***I will ask at the next meeting that the Council re-consider the creation of a one***

***way traffic system at what is locally known as the Jail Boreen, linking Mulgrave***

***Street and Roxborough Road, due to safety concerns expressed by residents.***

**REPLY:**

**Roxborough Avenue Traffic Characteristics**

Roxborough Avenue is a narrow residential road which links Roxborough

Road (Regional Road R511) to Blackboy Road / Mulgrave Street (Regional

Road R527).

The road is locally known as “Gaol Boreen”. Thirteen residential properties

are located on the road with provision for on street parking which is

unregulated. One commercial vehicle access to H.S.E. property at St.

Joseph’s Hospital is also located on the road. The road has an average

width of 5.0m and footpaths are available on one side of the road only.

Double yellow line parking prohibitions operate along almost the entirety of

the road. These parking prohibitions are a statutory provision provided

adjacent to Limerick Prison which fronts a significant part of the road. Very

significant traffic congestion and disruption occurs along Roxborough

Avenue and at its junctions with Roxborough Road and Mulgrave Street at

peak periods.

**One Way Proposal**

The City & County Council have on a number of occasions proposed that

Roxborough Avenue be converted into a one way street to operate in a

Northbound direction from Roxborough Road to Mulgrave Street.

The purpose of this proposal is primary to relieve congestion along the

roadway and at its junction with Roxborough Road and along Roxborough

Road. However, the Council was unable to get the full support of residents

to introduce this one way traffic proposal.

Against this background the City and County Council Traffic Department is

of the view that consideration of this one way traffic proposal is again

warranted at this time. The proposal would require a plebiscite of

residents and property owners to be undertaken and consultation with the

Gardai as the traffic authority. Where 80% of residents or property owners

or operators agree to the change then the project could be implemented

within a few days.

The members should note that introduction of this one way traffic scheme

would require the provision of traffic calming along the road. No additional

parking would be made available as the Limerick Prison statutory parking

provisions would remain. The estimated cost of the provision of this

project is €5,000.

Question submitted by Councillor Jerry O’Dea

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update regarding the current and future plans***

***for Rathbane Municipal Golf Course in light of the ongoing temporary***

***maintenance situation that currently exists.***

**REPLY**:

Rathbane Golf Course is an 18 hole municipal golf course situated

adjacent to Southill and Mount St. Oliver cemetery in Limerick. The course

hosts Rathbane Golf Club, and also provides golfing opportunities to

annual and pay-as-you-go clients, who are not members of Rathbane Golf

Club.

In 2003 Limerick City Council entered into a contract for the operation and

management of the course for a 5 year period with an option to extend for

At the request of Councillor Prendiville, it was agreed that items 17 and 18 would be

taken next.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District endorse the***

***Doras Luimni 'Fair Work Standards' campaign, as a step towards making Limerick***

***City a great place for worker rights.***
---
8

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that this campaign sought to provide

information on the rights and entitlements of workers and entailed surveys of employers

and employees.

The Meetings Administrator undertook to refer the motion to the Community, Leisure and

Emergency Services Strategic Policy Committee where a presentation on this topic

could be arranged.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the***

***Government to take urgent action to provide the thousands of social and***

***affordable houses needed for the homeless, those on housing waiting lists and***

***those coming to Ireland to seek refuge from war and persecution in the Middle***

***East and North Africa. We extend our solidarity and welcome to those refugees,***

***and call on the Council to work with other interested groups locally to investigate***

***what they can do to help provide support, sanctuary and security.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville highlighted the plight of the refugees from

the Middle East and North Africa and the need for response at national and local level.

The Meetings Administrator pointed out that the motion would be forwarded to the

Government and read out the following reply on behalf of the Home and Community

Directorate.

**REPLY**:

I wish to acknowledge your Notice of Motion and advise Limerick City &

County Council is working closely with all agencies with regard to our

housing waiting list and will play its part when required by the Irish

Naturalisation and Immigration Service.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that*** ***Limerick City and County Council reduce the***

***city centre prime parking times to 30 minutes or maximum of 45 minutes to***

***promote turnover of spaces, to increase customer numbers and reduce abuse of***

***spaces through long term occupancy.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Hourigan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler highlighted the abuse of on street parking

through long term occupancy and the need to encourage the use of long term off street

parking.

Members expressed reservations in relation to the motion and made the following points

during discussion of the motion;
---
9

 The motion should apply to only some spaces on certain streets.

 Extensive consultation with all involved should be undertaken before any changes

are made.

 The present arrangement whereby car owners can pay for 30 minutes parking,

through Park Magic, works well and more parking spaces are needed.

 Some car owners don’t like to use multi storey car parks or find them too expensive.

The Council should look at ways of encouraging people to stay on in town by having

free parking in the mornings after the school drop off.

 Not all multi storey car parks are open in the evenings and discussions in relation to

Christmas parking should commence now.

 Traffic Wardens have a common sense approach to parking and it would be unwise

to make alterations at this time.

The Meetings Administrator informed Members that an extensive reply had been

prepared in response to this motion and that he would circulate same after the meeting

and refer the motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee.

For the benefit of Members the Meetings Administrator read out the following segment of

the aforementioned reply:

**REPLY:**

In response to the items raised in the Notices of Motion in relation to

providing for either a maximum of 30 or 45 minutes parking on-street it

should be noted that this is one of several different proposals in relation to

parking that have been brought forward by members for consideration over

the past year. The current Parking Bylaws approved by Council allow for a

maximum stay of 2 hours on any street and there is a general acceptance

of this 2 hour period from the business community and parking users. Any

previous changes to how parking operates have always led to confusion

among users and as a result a higher number of appeals to fixed penalty

notices. As each of the proposals brought forward by members in relation

to the operation of parking over the past year have all been different.

Therefore any of the proposed changes to the way parking is operated in

the city will have consequential effects. The traffic department do not at

this time recommend any changes to the parking system as what is in

place is well accepted and is working reasonably well for the majority of

users and the business and residential communities. If the members

believe that the current system of on street parking management needs

reviewing then it is recommended that this issue should be an item for

review and consideration by the Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) on

Transport where the current operation of the on street parking system can

be reviewed and a new policy’s and procedures developed if required.

As noted above the vast majority of car parking in the city centre is

provided in off-street car parks and on-street car parking occupancy is

running at close to 100%. There is not really an issue with getting people

to use on-street parking. The bigger issue is that it is a limited resource.

Private Car Parking short term charges are generally much higher than on-

street and this also needs to be considered as part of any review of how

parking operates.

The Members should also be aware that income from parking is used to

run the traffic light system, provide new road markings and signs, and
---
10

provide school wardens as well as improvement and maintenance of city

centre streets. Any loss of parking revenue by providing an alternative

charging system on-street will result in a loss of revenue for these

essential services and this revenue will have to be found from other

sources.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council set aside a budget and invite***

***other like-minded people to set up a committee to celebrate the 325**th*** ***Anniversary***

***of the Signing of the Treaty of Limerick next year.***

Councillor Gilligan informed the meeting that he had agreed to withdraw the motion on

condition that it be forwarded to the 1916 Commemorative Committee for consideration.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

***I will move at the next meeting that*** ***the Council explore the possibility of obtaining***

***and refurbishing the derelict flats commonly known as the “Newly Wed Flats” at***

***the junction of Mary Street and Creagh Lane.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

The Director, Environment and Water noted that these houses were originally owned by

the Dioceses and were now in Council ownership. He informed Members that the

Housing Department were developing proposals to bring these houses back to active

use as housing units. Costs were being assessed and a timeframe for the project would

be available in the immediate future.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council take immediate action to resolve***

***the ongoing problems associated with student events taking place in licensed***

***premises in the Milk Market area. Residents have to endure the noise from taxis***

***and the associated assembly of students in the streets from approximately 10:30***

***pm until 3:30 am each and every Tuesday and Thursday night during the college***

***term September to June. The unauthorised taxi activity taking place in Little***

***Gerard Griffin Street continues to cause major problems for residents.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh highlighted the difficulties being

experienced by the many residents in this area and noted that residents were now

calling for their properties to be sound proofed. He pointed out that the Taxi Regulator

had taken steps to resolve this issue and these had been effective for a period.

Members supported the motion and made the following observations during discussion

on the motion;

 The nite clubs in the area should be required to close at 2.00 p.m.
---
11

 The Council owned car park at this location should be secured at night.

 Traffic should be blocked from key streets and the flow of pedestrians and traffic

should be redirected.

 The Gardai should be engaged with in an effort to resolve this issue.

 The possibility of using byelaws to alleviate the problem should be examined along

with a review of any licences issued to the premises in question.

The Meetings Administrator undertook to bring the issues raised to the attention of the

Taxi Regulator and the Gardai and suggested that the matter also be brought to the

attention of the Joint Policing Committee.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Michael Sheahan and

Marian Hurley

***I will move at the next meeting that the Street Ambassador Programme be***

***reintroduced in 2016.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Hurley.

Councillor Hurley noted the possibility of availing of the services of Volunteer Limerick as

an interim measure and the need to engage with Failte Ireland and Limerick Marketing in

this regard.

**REPLY:**

The Limerick Street Ambassadors programme was run by the

Limerick Communications Office (formerly Coordination Office) over the

last ten years or so, until the Limerick Communications office ceased to

exist in 2013. The service was funded by a combination of funds from the

(then) Limerick City Council, Limerick County Council and Shannon

Development.

Limerick Marketing ran the programme on a one off basis in 2014 given

the City of Culture year. For resource issues the programme wasn’t run in

2015 but the restoration of the Limerick Street Ambassadors programme is

under review for future years, as part of the current review of marketing

and festivals & events being undertaken under the change process.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council examine the***

***possibility of developing the River Shannon area between the Docklands and***

***Thomond Bridge as a regular space for water sports, recreation, etc. and that a***

***dedicated sub-committee comprised of the relevant water bodies, users, officials***

***and Councillors should be set up to examine the proposed project.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Lynch and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Lynch emphasised the potential of the river to

enhance business and tourism and the need to develop this potential in a strategic

fashion. He stressed the need to celebrate and cherish the river and suggested that the

use of extra lighting at night to ensure that the river flowed in light through the city could

be used as a positive theme in this regard.
---
12

Members supported the motion and the following points were made by Members during

discussion of this motion;

 Efforts should be made to affirm the positive aspects of the river. Fishing areas

should be considered and University of Limerick should be contacted to establish if

they could move some of their water activity resources into the city. Waterways

Ireland should be consulted in relation to any planned activities on the river.

 The river should be made a focal point of the city and any walkways adjacent to the

river should be developed to their full potential.

 Proposals in relation to the membership of the proposed group should be developed

and brought back to the Members and it was important that Councillors be

represented on any such committee.

 An annual boat race between Limerick Institute of Technology and University of

Limerick should be organised.

**REPLY:**

The Council will liaise with Waterways Ireland and other appropriate bodies

regarding the establishment of a dedicated sub committee to examine the

possibility of developing The Docklands and Thomond Bridge as a space

for water sports.

The terms of reference and the representative bodies to be part of this

working group will be considered following consultation with Waterways

Ireland, the navigation authority for the River Shannon.

In response to a query, the Senior Engineer noted that a section of the riverwalk

adjacent to the Condell Road was still closed off as it was in a dangerous condition and

that any works in the immediate future would be of a temporary nature until adequate

funding was sourced. He highlighted that, on foot of studies carried out by the OPW,

embankments around the city may need to be raised and he would take steps to

organise a briefing for the Members from the OPW in this regard.

19.

Correspondence

The Meetings Administrator noted that correspondence had been received from Gas

Networks Ireland on behalf of the Commission for Energy Regulation led Carbon

Monoxide Awareness Week Industry Group in relation to Carbon Monoxide Awareness

Week.

This concluded the Meeting.

3. Home and Social Development:
Cluid Housing Association

The Director of Home & Social Development gave an up-date to Members in relation to
Cluid Housing Developments at Gortboy, Newcastle West, and Cois Féile, Abbeyfeale, as

follows:

Gortboy, Newcastle West (Phase 2):

The Director stated that in 2005, Cluid Housing Association provided 42 units of
accommodation in Newcastle West. In 2009, Cluid Housing Association received approval
for €2,353,459 from the Department of the Environment for the construction of a further 11
units of accommodation in Newcastle West. She further stated that the Project was
funded under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme and involved a loan application by the
Council to the Housing Finance Agency. The approval to draw down this amount was
received from the Council on 13"" November, 2009.

The Director also outlined that, while the Project was at construction stage and
unoccupied, loan charges were incurred by the Council on the loan of €2,353,459
borrowed from the Housing Finance Agency. These charges were added to the Project
when it was completed and loan charges accrued from 2009 to 2011.

In 2012, the final account was submitted to the Department of the Environment and this
included loan charges to the value of €122,337. Following examination of the final
account, extra funding was approved by the Department on 28" October, 2014 and this
funding would cover charges incurred by the Council.

Cois Na Féile, Abbeyfeale:

The Director stated that the Council had received a detailed Project Plan from Cluid
Housing Association in relation to the completion of 12 houses at Cois na Féile,
Abbeyfeale. Tenders were invited from 6 contractors for completion of the works and the
closing date for receipt of tenders was 21" November, 2014.

Cluid Housing Association had estimated that they would have completed the review of
tenders and the tender report in early December 2014. An estimated timeframe of four
weeks had been allocated for this process.

Cluid Housing Association stated that works would commence on site in early February
2015 and that the completion of contract and snag list was estimated to take 28 weeks
which would mean that the anticipated completion date was July 2015. Cluid Housing
Association stated, however, that the completion of the scheme was dependent on
Department approval within the timeframe specified. They also stated that Members
would be kept up-to-date on progress of the scheme.

Two Representatives, Neil Bolton and James O'Halloran, attended on behalf of Cluid
Housing Association and replied to questions from Members. They stated that there had
been design issues at Gortboy which had been resolved. They admitted that workmanship
had been very poor and that the works carried out were not satisfactory. They outlined
that the total cost of the 13 units (10 houses and 3 apartments) was in the region of €2.3

million.

They stated that Cois Na Féile, Abbeyfeale, was an unfinished development on the
outskirts of Abbeyfeale. They outlined that there were 24 units (12 of those for private
sale) which were partially completed. They stated that one stage payment had been paid
to the developer. The development had since been turned into a construction project and
Cluid Housing Association was doing all the ground works. The Representative stated that
everything had been agreed and that the project had gone to tender. The Operations
Manager stated that footpaths, public lighting and surface water drainage would be
provided as part of the scheme.

Members thanked Cluid Housing Association for attending the Meeting.

2. Customer Services:

The Executive Architect circulated to Members revised copy plans of the Proposed
Refurbishment Works/Customer Service Improvements to be undertaken at Council
Offices, Newcastle West. She outlined that the two existing Meeting Rooms would remain
as they were and that they would be made available to Members at all times for individual
Meetings. It was agreed that phones, printers and photocopiers would be provided in the
Meeting Rooms and that the printers would be compatible for use with iPads. The
Executive Architect also outlined that there would be a new Customer Service’s Desk with

a proper seating area provided.

It was stated that the Refurbishment Works would go to tender shortly and works would
commence in the New Year. The works were expected to take one to two months to

Planning and Economic Development Department are in discussions with NAMA in this

regard

Cluain Arra, Gortboy: A snag list has been issued to the Bond Holder for the scheme who
has appointed Consulting Engineers to carry out their own costings. The Council is
awaiting agreement to be reached with the Bond Holder to have works commenced onsite
or to release the bond to Limerick City & County Council who can carry out the works.

10. Question submitted by Councillor M. Collins

| will ask at the next Meeting if CCTV can be installed at Ash, Oak, Rowan and
Sycamore Crescents to monitor and stop anti-social behaviour at these estates.

REPLY: The Council’s Estate Management Unit is in close contact on an ongoing
basis with individual residents within this estate and is not aware that there
are any serious problems with anti-social behaviour there. The Unit is aware
that a serious assault took place on the entrance road to the estate recently
and is liaising with An Garda Siochana in this regard. Should anybody from
within the estate, who is an occupant of a tenanted house, be convicted of
any criminal charges relating to this incident, appropriate action will be taken
in accordance with the terms of the Letting Agreement.

Having regard to the foregoing, the Council does not see the need for the
installation of CCTV cameras within the estate and, in any event, does not
have the necessary financial resources for what would be an expensive

project.

The Members queried if there was a policy in place regarding CCTV and they proposed
that funding be made available to the Council for the provision of CCTV in housing estates.
It was agreed that it would be referred to the Strategic Policy Committee.

circulated at the Meeting. Records of each Burial Ground are retained
locally. A contact list for the caretakers of these Burial Grounds can also be
circulated after the Meeting.

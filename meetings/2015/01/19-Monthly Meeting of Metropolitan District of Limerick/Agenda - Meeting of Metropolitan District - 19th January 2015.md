QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

| will ask at the next meeting that the Council investigate the possibility of turning a
green area which is close to the Main Street in Patrickswell into parking spaces to
facilitate business and customers.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

| will move at the next Meeting that:

1) the Road Project Team will supervise the Route 4 Ballysimon, Castletroy and
Newtown Infrastructure Improvement Works when these would happen this
year,

2) information leaflets on dates and times will be distributed in a timely manner
to residents living in the immediate area where works will be carried out, and

3) safety road signage will be put in place until the works are completed for local
residents’ safety.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhir. Séighin fo) Ceallaigh

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick calls on the
Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys, to recognise and act
on her responsibility as Heritage Minister to protect and preserve the historic Moore
Street area of Dublin City, including the terrace 10-25 Moore Street which was
occupied by the Volunteers at the end of Easter Week 1916 and where the final
meeting of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic took place. This
requires the preservation not only of the National Monument 14-17 Moore Street but
the protection of the terrace and of the integrity of the surrounding area which has
been described as 'the lanes of history’ and which has the potential to be sensitively
developed as an historic quarter of our capital city, enhancing the living market
trading tradition and bringing to life the area's central role in the 1916 Rising.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick write to the
Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation calling on him to amend the Companies
Bill 2012 to include a provision that will prevent unscrupulous directors exploiting
company law to withhold outstanding pay and other earned entitlements.

Notice of Motion mi by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

| will move at the next meeting that, following work on the replacement of water
pipes in the Ballynanty Beg area over elevated lead levels in the water supply, the
Metropolitan District of Limerick now calls on Irish Water, in conjunction with the
HSE, to immediately issue notices to every house in Ballynanty Beg to confirm if
their water is safe to drink or if the advice issued by the HSE in July not to drink the
water remains in place and that this Council also carries out an inspection in the
Ballynanty Beg area to ensure that footpaths, roads and garden walls etc that have
been damaged in the work are repaired and returned to their previous condition.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick demands
the intervention of both of Limerick’s two Government Ministers to ensure that the
additional beds at the A&E in the University Hospital in Dooradoyle are opened
immediately and requests the Minister of Health to immediately expedite the
equipping and staffing of the new Emergency Department at the University Hospital
Limerick in order to make the new facility operational.

The new Emergency Department at University Hospital Limerick is scheduled to
open in 2016 but some out of the box thinking is needed by management and
government to find a solution to the crisis that exists at present in the hospital.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick calls on the
Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to move
immediately to review rent supplement caps in Limerick. The unrealistic rates are
causing a real housing crisis and forcing many people including families into
homelessness.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

| will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we erect
a plaque ‘at or near Hanratty’s Hotel, Glentworth Street to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of Che Guevara's visit to Limerick on March 13th 1965.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller

| will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that we
register our support for the planned nurses industrial action by the INMO in the
University Hospital Limerick. Nursing and other staff are forced to take this drastic
action in light of the chronic and persistent overcrowding and the failure of the
Minister for Health's promise to provide extra beds and staff, which are long over
due.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Loftus

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick calls on Irish
Water to cease the installation of meters in properties where it is known that the
connection is comprised of lead piping.

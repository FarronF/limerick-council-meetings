The Chief Executive stated that there was a provision clearly made in

relation to changing the title of Cathaoirleach of the Council. In order to avoid

confusion, the title of Mayor was clearly understood whereas the title of

the title and that Councillor Kevin Sheahan’s title going forward, if approved, would

be Mayor of the City and County of Limerick and Councillor Crowley’s title would be

Deputy Mayor of the City and County of Limerick. The Chief Executive was

recommending these changes.

Following considerable discussion on the subject, Councillor Collins (M)

proposed changing the title of Cathaoirleach to *Mayor of the City and County of*

*Limerick.* This proposal was seconded by Councillor Gilligan.

Councillor Sheahan (M) stated that he was not in agreement and proposed an

Amendment that the matter be deferred for a period of 3 months. This proposal was

relation to the performance of his/her Executive Functions. As Meetings of the

The proposed Sectoral Representation on each Strategic Policy Committee

consider this, along with the adoption of the Scheme. Following adoption, it was

proposed to write to the various Pillars outlined and the Public Participation Network

(PPN) seeking nominations of Sectoral members to the 5 Strategic Policy

Committees. One month would be allowed for receipt of nominations.

The report went on to say that a total of 80 vacancies across the 5

The Head of Finance explained that the request for approval for overdraft

accommodation was made each year to Members. In response to some queries

raised, he stated that the previous year it had not been necessary to use any of the

overdraft. He further clarified that it was merely a safeguard since a number of grant

payments to the Council were made retrospectively. He also responded that the

interest rate for the overdraft was 2.25% and that the Council was constantly working

with the Bank in this regard.

Proposed by Councillor Leddin;

Seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon;

accommodation in the sum of €31.5 million for the twelve month period ending 31st

Meeting approving the terms of an overdraft facility and various terms loans

being made available by Allied Irish Banks to the Council, subject to the terms

and conditions in letter of sanction dated the 3rd July, 2014, addressed by the

Bank to the Council. He stated that there was an error in that the letter of

sanction was dated 19th September, 2014. Accordingly, it would be

necessary to rescind the previous resolution and a new resolution was now

required.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Leddin;

And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act, 2001, the

approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the terms of an overdraft facility

Home and Social Development

Raising of Loan – Clúid Housing Association

€2,353,459 in January 2009 and that following previous approval of the Council,

had been examined by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local

Government and a further €90,263 had been approved. The approval of the Council

to raising a loan of €90,263 was being sought.

Members stated that there had been a number of problems with

developments built by Clúid in the past and that the Council should take a more

proactive role in the supervision of the works.

Following considerable discussion, it was agreed that clarification be sought

on what the funding was to be used for. It was proposed by Councillor Galvin,

seconded by Councillor Scanlan, and agreed that the item be deferred until such

time as it was ascertained what the funding was for and that the matter be discussed

at a Meeting of the Municipal District and then brought back to the full Council.

***Suspension of Standing Orders:*** As the time was approaching 5.30pm, on the

proposal of Councillor Galvin, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), Standing Orders

were suspended in order to complete the Agenda.

The issue of the Mayor’s intention to visit London was then discussed at

length. Generally speaking, Members supported the Mayor’s proposal to visit

London where he would meet with a number of Irish immigrants. Former

Cathaoirligh and Mayors spoke on the matter and it was felt that foreign visits were

good public relations exercises and formed part of the duties of the Office. It was

stated that if even one job were created as a result, then it would be worthwhile.

Irish Water. Terms and conditions in relation to the issuing of

water bills, specific to each of the former Local Authorities,

remain unchanged. On former County accounts, where a

customer has a third and subsequent meter on their account,

the standing charge is reduced on the third and subsequent

meter to €50 per six months.

**(b)** Water charges are to be clarified by Irish Water.

**(c)** On account with multiple meters, the standing charge is

reduced on the third and subsequent meter to €50 per six

months. Where a connection has a domestic element, a

domestic allowance is allowed amounting to 228m3 per six

months.

resulting in a higher than average water charge, Limerick City

and County Council may on occasion apply a leak write-off to

the account. Proof must be supplied that the leak is fixed and

information in relation to the finding of same must be provided.

The write-off is calculated based on an analysis of average

water use. The usage in excess of this average figure is

applied to the additional leak usage. Permission must be sought

from Irish Water to apply such a write-off to the account.

City and County Council, Music Generation and independent

practitioners who would be tasked with charting a future for 69

O’Connell Street.

***feasibility of online live streaming and/or provision of pod casts and/or video***

***houses, this Council put in place a system where all householders are***

***contacted with a view to having them request the Council to have their estate***

***taken-in-charge within five years of the granting of a Commencement Notice.***

Councillor Gilligan, in proposing the Motion, stated that Limerick City and

County Council should become much more proactive in this regard and that all

housing estates should be taken-in-charge after a period of 5 years.

Councillor Sheahan (J) seconded the Motion with the proviso that housing

estates were to be taken-in-charge once all snag lists had been completed.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council supports**

**the Carers’ Association and calls on the Minister for Social Protection to**

**amend the Social Welfare Bill to make provision for the restoration of the**

**Respite Care Grant.**
---
16

Councillor Browne, in proposing the Motion, stated that Limerick City and

County Council needed to recognise the home as being the centre of care within the

community. He proposed that the Council write to the Minister for Social Protection

to restore the respite care grant.

Councillor McMahon seconded the Motion.

Councillor Collins (M) said he wished to make an amendment to the Motion to

include the following: to restore - cuts to Jobseeker's Allowance for under 25s; child

benefit to its former allowance; maternity benefit where the Minister had made it

taxable; back to school footwear and clothing allowance; €300 education

allowances; redundancy rebate; household benefits package including the

telephone allowances; the core weekly social welfare payment of Jobseekers which

was cut by 3 months to 9 for full PRSI contributors and 6 months for partial

contributors; the Fuel allowance; back to school allowance which was slashed by

changing the age eligibility; the cut to one parent family allowance; farm assist

which was hit with new income restrictions.

Members stated that the emphasis of the Motion was Respite Care and that

the spirit of the Motion was related to Carers.

Following further discussion, it was agreed that the original Motion, as

proposed by Councillor Browne and seconded by Councillor McMahon, would be

forwarded to the Minister for Social Protection.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Members of the Council call on the***

***Executive to guarantee that Council tenants will not face any trouble from the***

***Council, or threat of eviction, for the non-payment of water charges or other***

***arrears on water bills prior to what now appears to be an inevitable withdrawal***

***of the charge by the Government under massive pressure from the protest***

***movement against such charges.***

Councillor Prendiville, in proposing the Motion, stated that this was a very

pressing and important matter. He added that many Council tenants were struggling

to make their rent payments. He stated that related penalties would not come into

effect until 2016.

Councillor Loftus seconded the Motion.

The Mayor indicated that Notices of Motion Nos. 15 and 18 would be taken

together:

**15.**

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that the speed limits for residential estates be***

***reduced from 50 km/h to 30 km/h on a phased basis in order to ensure the***

***safety of children at play and general pedestrian population.***

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Byrne

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council welcomes Circular RSD***

***01/2014 on the Control of Vehicle Speeds in Housing Estates, issued by***

***Paschal Donohoe TD, Minister for Transport, Tourism & Sport, to all Local***

***Authorities (following his meeting with the ‘Jake’s Legacy Campaign’)***

***requiring an examination of speed limits in residential areas and housing***

***estates to improve road safety for cyclists and pedestrians, especially***

***children; and that this Council, in line with the Circular, initiate consultation***

***with residents across our county with a view to determining the need for new***

***bye-laws for 30 km/h limits for residential estates and additional selected***

***safety zones.***

Councillor Butler, in proposing his Motion, stated that this was a matter of

traffic calming measures and the examination of speed limits in estates across the

County. He stated that the cost of one ramp was €3,200 and that therefore the costs

involved for all housing estates would be considerable. He added that the speed

limit should therefore be reduced to 30 km/h.

Councillor Byrne proposed her Motion.

Councillor Neville seconded both Motions and pointed out that there were 2/3

cars in almost every house in estates.

Members generally supported the Motion.

With the permission of the Mayor, Councillor O’Donoghue proposed the

following Motion:

**“I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City & County Council**

**insist that the National Roads Authority and Limerick City & County**

**Council, without delay, put a plan in place to ensure the safety of road-**

**users, pedestrians and residents in relation to the stretch of the N20**

**from Anhid Cross to Rockhill Cross and including Hynes' Cross,**

**Banogue Cross and Banogue Village and O'Rourke's Cross. Safety**

**measures must include a review of signage, road-markings, lighting and**

**road surface as this stretch of road is not fit for purpose and has**

**resulted in 20 fatalities in ten years, accidents in double-figures and**

**daily 'near-misses'.**

Councillor O’Donoghue stated that the speed limit in Banogue was 50 km/h

and that the road was not fit for purpose. He added that he had made several

submissions to the National Roads Authority in this regard.
---
18

Councillor Donegan, in seconding the Motion, said that 90% of the traffic

going through O’Rourke’s Cross was breaking the speed limit.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council make***

***waste bye-laws for city and county as soon as possible for the purpose of***

***regulating and controlling the early morning collection of waste.***

Councillor Secas, in proposing the Motion, stated that there were collections

taking place as early as 5.00 a.m. and that this was impacting negatively on people’s

lives.

Councillor Collins (M), in seconding the Motion, stated that in Newcastle

West, operators were collecting waste at 2.00 a.m.

Members generally felt that this was an issue that needed regulation as there

were also business premises whose waste was not being collected until after

midday.

**REPLY:**

Draft bye-laws, the ‘Limerick City and County Council, Storage,

presentation and Collection of Household and Commercial Waste Bye-

Laws’ are currently in the course of preparation and will be brought for

consideration to the Environmental Strategic Policy Committee as soon

as possible following the establishment of the Strategic Policy

Committees early in 2015.

An article dealing with collection times for household or commercial

waste will be included in the draft bye-laws for consideration by the

Members.

With the permission of the Mayor, Councillor Gilligan proposed the following

Motion:

**“I will move at the next Meeting that this Council, recognising the**

**enormous generosity shown by Mr. J.P. McManus, welcome his decision**

**to hold another Golf Classic, the proceeds of which go to worthy**

**causes, and requests the Government not to deduct the considerable**

**time he will have to spend organising the event from his tax residency**

**allowance. I further move that this Motion be circulated to all TDs in the**

**Mid-West area.**

Councillor Gilligan stated that J.P. McManus had given well over €100m and

time and energy to local charities and that this needed to be acknowledged.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Donegan and agreed.
---
19

In response to a suggestion that there should be a Civic Reception held in his

honour, the Mayor pointed out that Mr. McManus had received the highest possible

honour from Limerick County Council and it was further stated that he had been

granted the Freedom of the City.

With the permission of the Mayor it was agreed to take Item No. 26 at this

time:

26.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

***I will move at the next Meeting that an amendment be made to Standing Orders***

***to change the full Council Meeting sittings from bi-monthly to monthly.***

Councillor Sheehy, in proposing the Motion, stated that it was very important

in order to complete the business of the Council and that monthly meetings were

required.

Councillor Browne, in seconding the Motion, stated that Members and officials

were there to carry out the business of the people and that Strategic Policy

Committees would start reporting back which would require monthly meetings.

The Mayor stated that Meetings should start at 10.00 a.m., break for lunch

and resume until the Agenda was complete.

Some Members felt that the problem was with the size of the Council and that

all 40 Members were entitled to express their views on various issues.

Councillor Collins (M), who was against the Motion, proposed that it should be

discussed by the Corporate Policy Group and Party Leaders and this proposal was

seconded by Councillor Donegan and agreed.

It was also agreed that this Motion would be included on the agenda for the

January 2015 Council Meeting.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council calls on***

***the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to review***

***the declaration of ‘off the road’ vehicles when declared off the road and that***

***the system in England, i.e. ‘Lifetime’ declaration and not ‘Annual’ be used.***

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, stated that any vehicles which

were not being used should not be required to make an annual declaration. In the

event that they were brought back into use, they could then be declared.  He

requested that this Motion be circulated to all Local Authorities and this was agreed.
---
20

Councillor Sheahan (J), in seconding the Motion, stated that it made sense

and that a vehicle which had not been used for some time could be declared back on

the road if necessary.

The Motion was supported by the Council.

It was noted that Item No. 18 had been dealt with earlier in the Meeting.

The Mayor, in proposing Motion No. 19 submitted by him, stated that he

would take his own Motion and Motion No. 25 together.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan, Mayor

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council would***

***accept my proposal of a Special Committee, which I have formed for the***

***purpose of giving advice to the full Council, by presenting a draft proposal of***

***plans to commemorate all events pertaining to the 1916 Rising. These events***

***would commence with the celebration of the centenary of the founding of***

***Cumann na mBan and follow on to mark the other significant dates in our***

***history up to 1923. The Committee I have selected consists of the five persons***

***who have been agreed to be the 5 Cathaoirligh over the life of this Council***

***together with the five Leas-Chathaoirligh over the same period. It should be***

***noted that this Committee will have absolutely no power to make decisions but***

***will make recommendations to the full Council for consideration.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins (M).

25.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh

***I will move at the next Meeting that a Committee be established comprising***

***Members from all parties represented on this Council to organise and arrange***

***events for the Centenary of the 1916 Rising.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by

Councillor Quinlivan.

There

was

much

discussion

regarding

the

importance

of

these

commemorations and it was agreed that the Committee being set up should be all-

inclusive with representation from each Party, as a vital part of the country’s history

was being celebrated. It was very important that Limerick honour this. It was also

stated that there should be public representation on the Committee via the Strategic

Policy Committees. Councillor Prendiville stated that they did not wish to be

represented on the proposed Committee.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S Ó Ceallaigh

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council introduce a bye-law to have***

***the Irish language and English language names spelt in the same font size on***

***the following permanent signage: (i) Way Signs, (ii) Name Plates, (iii) Street***

***name Plates, and that a Gaelic style font will be used in order to differentiate***

***between the Irish and English names on these signs. This will be implemented***

***on a basis of new signage required, and will not require the replacement of any***

***signs due to this bye-law alone.***

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, in proposing the Motion, stated that the title of Mayor

should be used in Irish. He further added that where street signs and community

signs were concerned, the top line should be in Gaelic script style. This, he said,

would apply for new signs or signs that were being replaced.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Secas who fully appreciated the

benefits of two languages. She further stated that Limerick City and County Council

should encourage shop owners to have their signs in Irish.

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting for a change to be made to the wording of***

***Objective SS 05 Chapter 3, Page 6, in the Limerick County Development Plan***

***2010-2016 to read: In order to retain the identity of towns/villages, to prevent***

***sprawl, and to ensure a distinction in character between built-up areas and the***

***open countryside, it is an objective to avoid linear frontage development***

***leading out of towns and villages except in exceptional circumstances.***

***Objectives A1, F1, M1, FM1, MP1, for the settlements of Foynes, Murroe, Athea,***

***Fedamore and Montpelier respectively should change text to replace the word***

***"directed" with "encouraged."***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that it was necessary

to avoid linear development. He added that statements of design had been

published on the towns mentioned in the Motion.

Councillor Sheahan (K) seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

The changes proposed to the policies are as follows (words to be

omitted are shown as strikethrough and words to be added are

underlined).

**Objective SS 05: Prevention of Urban Sprawl**

In order to retain the identity of towns / villages, to prevent sprawl, and

to ensure a distinction in character between built-up areas and the

open countryside, it is an objective to prevent avoid linear roadside

frontage development on roads leading out of towns and villages

except in exceptional circumstances.
---
22

The proposal is also to amend the following Objectives:

**Objective A1:**

Development shall be directed encouraged inside the development

boundary of the town as indicated on Map A-1. All development

proposals will have regard to the Athea Village Design Statement.

**Objective F1:**

Development shall be directed encouraged inside the development

boundary of the town as indicated on Map A-2. All development

proposals will have regard to the Foynes Theme Town Plan recently

published by Limerick County Council.

**Objective M1:**

Development shall be directed encouraged inside the development

boundary of the town as indicated on Map A-3. All development

proposals will have regard to the ‘Murroe Village Design Statement’

adopted by Limerick County Council.

**Objective FM1:**

Development shall be directed encouraged inside the development

boundary of the town as indicated on Map A-4 and in areas zoned for

development according to the land use zoning objectives and land use

zoning matrix.

**Objective MP1:**

Development shall be directed encouraged inside the development

boundary of the town as indicated on Map A-5 and in areas zoned for

development according to the land use zoning objectives and land use

zoning matrix.

It is considered that the proposed changes do not serve any purpose in

that they do not alter the overall meaning of the objectives in the plan.

The Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) requires

objectives in the County Development Plan to be consistent with

Section 28 Ministerial Guidance Documents, such as “Sustainable

Rural Housing,” 2005, “Sustainable Residential Development in Urban

Areas,” 2009, and Local Area Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities,”

June 2013. All of these guidelines support the need for a clear

distinction between the urban edge and the open countryside in small

towns/villages, which is what these objectives require.

The Notice of Motion proposed would require a variation to the County

Development Plan to implement the changes. The variation is an

onerous process and, in this case, would not achieve any difference in

the outcome of the policy.
---
23

Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that he had no problem going to the Minister.

He added that a clear definition of rural and country was required. The country, he

added, had a scattered settlement policy which had been inherited with no real plan

for the open countryside. He queried that if the Motion changed nothing, why was it

not just put through.

The Senior Planner stated that it was the function of the Council to either

make or vary the Plan and that the matter could be discussed further at the

Economic Development and Planning Strategic Policy Committee. This was agreed.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council calls on***

***the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Children to investigate the alleged***

***movement of sex offenders from Northern Ireland to the twenty-six county***

***Republic and, in particular, Limerick City and County.***

Councillor Keary proposed the Motion in making reference to the Maria Cahill

case.

Councillor Galvin, in seconding the Motion, said that names of offenders had

been given to the Gardaí. He stated that he hoped justice would take its course. He

requested that the Motion be circulated to all Local Authorities and this was agreed.

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Donegan

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council establish***

***an external independent investigation into the actions of Limerick County***

***Council in relation to the proposed development at Ardagh (Planning***

***Application Ref Nos. 06/3641 & 08/1288).***

Councillor Donegan stated that he wished to make an amendment to the

wording of the Motion to read as follows: “I will move at the next Meeting *that the*

*Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government**be requested to*

*establish an external investigation into the actions of Limerick County Council in*

*relation to the proposed development at Ardagh (Planning Application Ref Nos.*

*06/3641 & 08/1288).”*

The Motion, as amended, was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).

Councillor Donegan stated that he wanted the matter dealt with speedily.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch

***I will move at the next Meeting that priority be given to setting up the Joint***

***Policing Committee as soon as possible to support An Garda Síochána at a***

***time of great change for the Force in light of the recent Garda Inspectorate***

***report.***

Councillor Lynch, in proposing the Motion, stated that the recently released

report on the Gardaí was very unfair. He hoped that all of the resources would not

be spent on technology because the Gardaí were stretched beyond belief. He

added that criminals were preying on the vulnerable. He said that it was imperative

that the Joint Policing Committee be set up without delay to support the Gardaí.

Councillor O’Hanlon seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

The Garda Commissioner has been requested to nominate two

representatives to the Joint Policing Committee and steps are in train

to fill the five places assigned to Oireachtas Members. When this

Section of the Committee is in place, it is proposed, in accordance with

the Guidelines, that the Committee will meet to decide the most

appropriate community-based organisations or groups that should be

represented to fill the final seven places on the Committee.

It was noted that item No. 25 had been dealt with earlier.

It was noted that Item No. 26 had been taken earlier in the Meeting.

27.

**Correspondence:**

The Correspondence circulated with the Agenda was taken as read.

Reference was made to a letter in ‘Correspondence’ from Kerry County

Council dated 12th November, 2014, addressed to the Chief Executive, urgently

seeking a by-pass for Adare.

It was suggested by Members that the Adare by-pass should be looked at in

conjunction with the Foynes-Limerick route selection process. Members stated that

there was constant traffic congestion in Adare and that pressure should be kept on

the Minister and on the National Roads Authority.

The Director of Travel and Transportation stated that public consultation

would take place early in the New Year regarding Foynes-Limerick route.

**Request from Limerick City Business Association:**

With the permission of the Mayor, it was noted that a request had been

received from the Limerick City Business Association who wished to make a

presentation to all Strategic Policy Committees and to the full Council.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S ORDERS:

The Register of Orders made by the Chief Executive up to the date of the

Meeting was available in the Council Chamber for inspection by the Members.

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT:

The Register of Decisions on applications under the Planning and

Development Acts, 2000-2014, was also available in the Council Chamber for

inspection by the Members.

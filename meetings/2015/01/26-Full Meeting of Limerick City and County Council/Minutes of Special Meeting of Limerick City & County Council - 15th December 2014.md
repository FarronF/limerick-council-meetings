The Cathaoirleach opened the Meeting by stating that the Special Meeting had been

convened to review the 2014 National City of Culture which was coming to an end

and to discuss the bid for Limerick for the title of European Capital of Culture 2020.

The Chief Executive addressed the Meeting and said that it was an opportune time

to review Limerick’s extraordinary successful year as National City of Culture and, in

particular, the Local Authority needed to build on the momentum and climate of

support for culture in Limerick in making a bid for the European Capital of Culture.---

He stated that the European Capital of Culture initiative was one of the most

prestigious and visible European Cultural Awards in the EU, and that it was awarded

on the strength of an exceptional Programme of Events. The Chief Executive stated

that in bidding for the designation of the European Capital of Culture, Limerick would

seek to maintain the climate of support for culture achieved in 2014. This would give

culture a real chance over a six year period while helping to deliver the economic,

social and cultural benefits for the City.

In relation to the National City of Culture, the Chief Executive said that the

performance of Royal De Luxe and the ‘Granny’ had become a focal part for what

had been a very successful year in the Region. He outlined that more than 200,000

people had visited Limerick over that weekend and acknowledged the huge amount

of work and effort that had been put in behind the scenes to make the event such a

success. He confirmed that there would be “no shortfall” in the finances of the Local

Authority as a result of the National City of Culture. He expressed his thanks to all

staff who had worked on the many events throughout the Year. He thanked the

Board and Staff of the National City of Culture and, in particular, extended his

appreciation to Mr. Mike Fitzpatrick, Director; Ms. Sheila Deegan, Arts and Culture

Manager; and Mr. Paul Foley, Senior Executive Officer, whose leadership and

determination had ensured the success of the Year.

In conclusion, the Chief Executive outlined the bidding process which would take

place in 2015 in order to achieve the title of European Capital of Culture for 2020. To

this end, he said funding would be provided as part of the draft budget to co-fund the

bid process. He extended his appreciation to the Members for their support during

the Year.

The Cathaoirleach then invited Mr. Mike Fitzpatrick, Director, Limerick City of

Culture, to present an overview of the City of Culture Year 2014.

Mr. Fitzpatrick addressed the Meeting and outlined the background to the Year. He

delivered a PowerPoint presentation under the following headings which included

video footage of some events:

• Limerick 2014 - Cultural Shift.

• Legacy of 2014 - Limerick City of Culture.

• Opportunity to continue.

• Potential of 2020/European Capital of Culture.

• 15-Year Plan.

Mr. Fitzpatrick responded to queries raised by the Members and provided further

detail in relation to the Cultural Strategic Proposal Bid for the European Capital of

Culture 2020. He explained to the Members that there were plans to establish a new

entity called “Creative Limerick” which would be based in Culture House. This new

entity, if established, would deliver a cohesive cultural strategy and would work on

the Programme and Infrastructural requirements for Limerick in the period 2015-

2030. He said “Creative Limerick” would act under the auspices of the Local

Authority and would encompass a stakeholder group and an executive.

He reiterated that the budget for the Year had been approximately €10 million and

that this amount had not been exceeded. He confirmed that the final account would

be fully available at the end of the year when all events had been fully completed

and accounts paid.

The Members thanked Mr. Fitzpatrick and his staff for the excellent presentation and

were unanimous in their praise for the National City of Culture Year. They

acknowledged that the Council was not funding any deficit after the year and, in this

regard, congratulated and commended the Board and staff of the National City of

Culture that had worked on the many events throughout the year. In conclusion, they

were unanimous in their support for the Council’s bid for the title of European Capital

of Culture 2020.

The Mayor opened the Meeting saying that it was a very historic Meeting since it was

the first Budget Meeting of Limerick City and County Council. He then invited the

Chief Executive to present an overview of the Draft Budget for 2015 to the Council.

In formally introducing the Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December,

2015, the Chief Executive confirmed that all the statutory requirements in relation to

the Budget had been complied with. In recommending the Budget to the Council for

consideration, the Chief Executive said the following:
---
**2**

**Today I present the first Budget of Limerick City and County Council. In doing so, I**

**have been mindful of the many issues that have been raised in the Council**

**Chamber and the challenges facing many citizens as we emerge from the last**

**number of years of economic turmoil.**

**The framing of the Budget has not been easy. The bringing together of the two**

**previous regimes has highlighted the many differences that previously operated in**

**practice and policy. The approach I have taken is to take a balanced view on where**

**agreed priorities have emerged in the Chamber and, in other cases, where policy is**

**not yet clear, provide a sum of money which will remain subject to a new policy**

**approach to be determined by the Council.**

**Before I highlight some of the features of the proposed budgets, I wish to briefly**

**review some of the issues and successes of 2014. The year started with**

**horrendous storms resulting with significant flooding in Foynes and many parts of**

**West Limerick and followed with the devastation experienced by residents of**

**Limerick City. Of course, further devastation was experienced in East Limerick in**

**July of 2014. This required a full-on emergency response to ensure those affected**

**were dealt with efficiently and sensitively. As the lead coordinator of this type of**

**response, I wish to acknowledge publicly the efforts of the Gardaí, HSE, the**

**Voluntary Agencies, the Communities and, of course, our own staff.**

**The** ***ask*** **to respond was once again put to the emergency services in September**

**2014 but in a very different context. The logistics and co-ordination required for**

**the visit of ‘Granny’ to Limerick was the first major event of this scale to be**

**organised in Limerick and was managed with the professionalism one has come to**

**expect from the emergency and voluntary services. The weekend of the visit of**

**‘Granny’ has become a focal part for what has been a very successful year for our**

**region in the context of the National City of Culture. I particularly wish to extend**

**my appreciation to the Board of the National City of Culture whose leadership and**

**determination ensured our success.**

**In February 2014, the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan was**

**approved by the then City Council. During 2014, a total of 174 projects were**

**supported by the Social Intervention Programme. A new focus on economic**

**projects in 2014 saw a total of 17 projects supported. It is intended to continue**

**with these programmes in 2015. The construction programme will be aggressively**

**advanced in 2015 with planning permission either obtained or nearing completion**

**for 235 visits. The thermal Upgrade Programme has advanced in 2014 with seven**

**building contracts complete and five more underway. All work on the 1,504 homes**

**involved will be completed by 2018.**

**The Government’s Housing Strategy has set an ambitious target of 35,000 units to**

**be provided over 6 years. Work has already commenced on the process of**

**identifying opportunities for the construction programme throughout the county**

**and these decisions will be progressed at District Level over the coming months.**
---

**Housing maintenance is consistently raised by Members throughout the year.**

**Provision has been made in the proposed budget to maintain the same level of**

**spend as in 2014. To maintain this level of spend, the same provision for Local**

**Property Tax (LPT) approved for 2014 has been restated in the proposed budget for**

**2015.**

**In relation to the Roads budget, the situation is as before. We must await the**

**distribution of Government grants before finalising programmes for 2015.**

**However, it is important to point out that, as an Authority, the provision of our**

**Own Resources has been maintained from 2014 to 2015.**

**A central part of “Putting People First” and, as a consequence, our new Authority,**

**is the enhanced role entrusted in Local Government in Economic Development.**

**The new Economic Unit has been structured to respond to the demands of Limerick**

**2030 and the challenges of attracting new and sustainable employment to Limerick**

**and the Mid-West. Since the establishment of our Economic Unit, including**

**Marketing and Innovation, we have seen: 118 overseas tourist/media visits, 7**

**major Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) announcements, 30 new retailers invested in**

**the City, 100 new retail jobs because of the Business Incentive Scheme**

**representing an investment of €1m in retail. We have advanced and completed**

**the acquisition of key strategic sites and will see the commencement of progress**

**on the Opera Site and Hanging Gardens in 2015. In 2015, we will seek to develop a**

**strategy that will focus on the significant issue of rural enterprise and follow**

**through on the investments made in 2014 in areas such as Rathkeale and**

**Kilmallock.**

**In the context of Waste Management, our Draft Waste Management Plan was**

**published in 2014. The consultation process is ongoing and will be discussed with**

**the Council in the coming weeks. The Plan envisages Ireland moving out of the**

**practice of disposal of waste in landfill with even greater emphasis on re-use and**

**recycle programmes. 2015 will see the introduction of “pay by weight” from mid-**

**year and provision has been provided in the proposed Budget to provide for a**

**waiver scheme for the urban and rural parts of Limerick. A sum of €440k has been**

**provided to support the introduction of such waiver, the policy for which has as yet**

**to be determined. Support continues to be provided to support the communities**

**in their successful endeavours in the National Tidy Towns Competition, in addition**

**to the local community competitions. The Gateway Scheme introduced in 2014**

**will continue in 2015 with even greater input into the local communities.**

**Spend on the Fire and Emergency Services is the single largest item of expenditure**

**in the budget book for 2015. This item of expenditure receives no central**

**government support and must be financed through our Own Resources. This**

**expenditure is necessary to sustain the quality of professional service to which we**

**have become accustomed. The Section 26 Plan which sets out the policy and**

**direction of the services going forward will be presented to Council for**

**consideration by mid-2015.**
---
**4**

**As mentioned earlier, Limerick, the Mid-West Region and Ireland have been**

**treated to a successful, enjoyable and culturally enlightening year as a**

**consequence of our year as National City of Culture. To build on this success and**

**prepare us for the European Capital of Culture bid 2020, I have included a sum of**

**€600k. This is not money to be spent on preparation of the bid, but in anticipation**

**of being successful to ensure sufficient resource is available at an early stage of**

**planning. A lesson learned from our experience to date.**

**One of the key strategies adopted by Council of recent years is making Limerick a**

**competitive location in which to do business. This has been achieved through**

**significant reduction in expenditure and income. The most significant element in**

**reduction in expenditure has been as a consequence of staff numbers reducing. In**

**all, we have seen a net reduction in numbers of 264, yet services have been**

**maintained to the best of our ability. This is due, in no small measure, to the**

**quality, flexibility and professionalism of our staff upon whom the honour of Local**

**Authority of the Year 2014 has recently been bestowed.**

**These efforts in adapting and changing means that Limerick can now promote itself**

**as being among the lowest rates multipliers in the Country,having the cheapest**

**parking, with attractive development and business support schemes.**

**The proposed Budget has been prepared to ensure our competitive position is**

**maintained and therefore there are no increases in rates or parking charges**

**proposed for 2015. I have also endeavoured to maintain a spend in areas of**

**housing and roads to support those most vulnerable and to ensure the road**

**infrastructure is maintained at a reasonable level. There is no doubt that we could,**

**of course, do with increasing our spend in these areas, particularly roads, where**

**we have seen very significant cuts in central funding. In the absence of central**

**funding increasing, we must give appropriate consideration to increasing our own**

**income base in coming years. The more we stand still, the further back our**

**capacity to maintain these services will be.**

**I wish to thank the Mayor and Deputy Mayor for their support to date. I wish to**

**thank the Directors and their staff for their commitment to Limerick in 2014 and in**

**the preparation of this Budget. I wish to particularly thank our Head of Finance**

**and his staff for their extraordinary efforts in shaping and preparing a most**

**difficult budget process.**

It was unanimously agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Budget

2015, as circulated to Members, be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:

**“Introduction**

I attach, for your consideration, the Draft Annual Revenue Budget for Limerick City

and County Council for year ending 31st December, 2015. This is an historic Budget
---
**5**

mainly due to the fact that it is the first Budget of the newly formed Limerick City and

County Council. The Budget provides for expenditure of €155.87m which is a

decrease of €17.29m on the 2014 budgeted figure of €173.16m. This net decrease is

represented in the main by the non-pay expenditure on water services, which is now

directly accountable by Irish Water. Also, as a result of the merger, local authority

cross charging for services has been eliminated.

Circular Fin. 05/2014 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit

Procedures) Regulations (S.I.226 of 2014), which came into effect from 1st June,

2014. The new Regulations restate many provisions of the 2002 Regulations and

take account of relevant provisions in the Local Government Act, 2001, and Local

Government Reform Act, 2014. The main provisions relate to the budget process for

local authorities with Municipal Districts and provide a timeline for draft budgetary

plans.

Circular Fin. 11/2014 referred to the Budget Meeting and other budgetary issues.

The prescribed period that applies for the holding of the 2015 Budget Meeting for

Limerick City and County Council is as follows: 1st January, 2015, to 24th January,

2015. It was agreed by the Members at the December Plenary Council Meeting to

hold the Annual Budget Meeting on Monday, 12th January, 2015.

The process and timeframe for putting together the draft Annual Budget for 2015

changed considerably this year. For the first time, as regards the Local Property Tax

variation, there was a public consultation process involved.

A series of meetings was held with the Corporate Policy Group in order to consider

Budget Strategy and the Local Property Tax variation. Also, as part of the new

process, a submission of preliminary estimates, of current along with capital income

and expenditure, was made to the Department of the Environment, Community and

Local Government. A special Budget Meeting was held in order to consider and

decide on the variation of the Local Property Tax rate and the Revenue

Commissioners and Department of the Environment, Community and Local

Government were notified of the outcome. The early submission of preliminary

budget figures on our current and capital accounts to the Department is aligned to

the National Budget and EU reporting requirements.

This is the first Budget that benefits from the new Local Property Tax (LPT) system.

Government has decided on a national equalisation model which commits 20% of

monies collected to national local government funding supports, while 80% is

maintained in theCounty of origin. The Council may, at its discretion, following public

consultation, increase or decrease LPT rates by 15%. The decision of this Council

was to reduce LPT in 2015 by 3% and the budgetary provision of €485,883 has been

made to meet this commitment.

**Rates Revaluation Process**

Limerick, during 2014, went through a rates revaluation process. This involved the

Valuation Office posting over 6,700 final Valuation Certificates to commercial and

industrial ratepayers in the Limerick City and County Council Rating Authority area
---
**6**

on 11th December, 2014. The new valuations will take effect from 1st January, 2015,

and will form the basis for commercial rates in Limerick in the current and

subsequent years. Last year, 2014, was historic as regards preparing the Budget as

it saw for the first time the rate harmonisation of both City and County. This resulted

in a substantial decrease in the rate demands payable by commercial businesses for

2014. Section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act, 2014, provides for an

amendment to rating law in relation to the refund of rates on vacant properties. This

change now gives the power to the Members of local authorities to vary the level of

rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the overall

administrative area of the local authority. Article 29 of the Local Government

(Financial & Audit Procedures) Regulations, 2014, provides that the decision to alter

the rate of refund should be decided at the Statutory Annual Budget Meeting and

that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall

apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The budget has

been framed on the basis of a level of refund of 50% of the rates payable on vacant

properties. It is recommended that this level of refund be applied to both City and

County for 2015.

**Economic Outlook**

Ireland, over the last 6 six years, has experienced extreme austerity and this has had

a negative impact on the monies available for local authorities to provide services

right across the sector. However, indications for 2015 appear to suggest that the

economy is likely to bounce back and show marginal growth. The Department

forecasts 3.9% growth in 2015 and 3.4% out to 2018. It also cites acceleration in

investment as well as consumption as the main reasons for the increase in economic

activity. Fixed investment is forecast to expand at double-digit rates in 2015. The

table below indicates the level of employment from 2009 and forecast to 2017. As

the figures suggest, the unemployment rate as a percentage of labour force is likely

to drop from 12% in 2009 to 8.9% in 2017. This is certainly encouraging news and

provides grounds for optimism as we head in to a new year.

**Local Enterprise Office**

The creation of the Limerick Local Enterprise Office replaces the former Limerick

City and County Enterprise Boards. The establishment of the Local Enterprise Office

(LEO) firmly places local government at the centre of local enterprise development.

With this initiative, the local authority here in Limerick will play a key role for the

development of economic growth not just for this administrative area but for the

entire Mid-West Region.

**Limerick Top Ten to Invest In**

I also want to again acknowledge the findings of the 6th Global ‘Best to Invest

Report’ that placed Limerick in the top ten metropolitan areas to invest in and

provides further evidence of Limerick’s growing status as an attractive location for

investment, both by existing companies operating in Limerick and those from

elsewhere seeking new foreign direct investment opportunities. The very fact that

Limerick has been placed alongside established business centres such as London,

Madrid, Dublin and Barcelona will inject a huge amount of confidence in the local

sector. It will also promote Limerick’s position globally as an investment location,

while this status can also be used by agencies responsible for attracting inward

investment in the Region. Limerick City and County Council, through the Limerick

Marketing Company, will be highlighting this Report when engaging with potential

investors. In 2014, we welcomed investment announcements by Regeneron

Pharmaceuticals with the creation of 300 jobs and Ethicon Biosurgery Ireland which

announced 270 new jobs as part of an €80m investment in Limerick. These

developments highlight that there is significant and positive change for Limerick. All

agencies responsible for the development and promotion of Limerick must continue

to work closely so as to ensure that the progress made in recent years is built on

and, in this regard, Limerick City and County Council looks forward to playing a

central role in such efforts.

**Local Government Reform Act, 2014**

The enactment by the Oireachtas last January of the Local Government Reform Act,

2014, heralded in a series of major changes for local government. There have also

been significant changes at regional governance level with the abolition of the former

eight Regional Authorities and their replacement by three new Regional Assemblies.

Also, for the first time, we have seen the introduction of a new Metropolitan District

along with three Municipal Districts. These Districts have new powers and the

democratically Elected Members within each District have a greater say into how

monies are spent and services are delivered. With this in mind, as part of the budget

process, the creation of a General Municipal Allocation of €1.5m in total for District

Members will provide a greater focus and clarity as regards how the Elected

Members want to account for the expending of monies within their area. Following

the adoption of the Budget, a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and repair

to be carried out during 2015 in each Municipal District will be prepared for

consideration and adoption by the Municipal District Members.

**National City of Culture**

December 2014 saw Limerick’s tenure as Ireland’s inaugural National City of Culture

come to an end. This was a very successful year that transformed Limerick into the

epicentre of the arts world and helped herald a new era of confidence and growth.

Undoubtedly, the visual highlight of the year was the performance of Royal De Luxe

and the ‘Granny’ which brought the world’s media to our doorstep. The positivity that

this production brought for those three days in September will live long in the

memory and the gathering of over 230,000 people helped to showcase the finest that
---
**8**

this City and County has to offer. The legacy part of the programme will continue and

will help develop and enshrine the rich culture of arts that exists in the Region.

Limerick City and County Council during 2015 will pursue a vigorous, active and

intensive bidding process in order to successfully achieve the title of European

Capital of Culture for 2020. In order to prepare for this designation, funding of €600k

is set aside in the draft Budget to co-fund the bid process and to help build up a fund

in order to deliver a programme that best showcases such a distinction.

**Audit Committee**

The Council’s new Audit Committee met back in December and, with the

establishment of NOAC (The National Oversight and Audit Commission), will provide

an increased oversight and scrutiny within the Local Government Sector. NOAC has

a wide range of functions that include the development of consistent audit principles

and is a very significant development in public accountability, bringing an added

dimension of independent scrutiny to local government performance.

**Budget 2015**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ending 31st December, 2015, to

Council, I wish to take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick

City and County Council as at 31st December, 2013. The Annual Financial Statement

of Limerick City and County Council for the year 2013 shows that the accumulated

balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit position of €573,822. Current outturn

figures indicate that it will be difficult to maintain the revenue credit in 2014, but every

effort will be made to break even. The 2015 draft Budget reflects the need to

continue a strong financial management ethos while making every effort to meet the

ever increasing demands on the services of Limerick City and County Council.

I will now set out the proposals for expenditure and Income for 2015.

The following table depicts Revenue expenditure by Division. As previously

mentioned, the expenditure for Budget 2015 is €155.87m. This compares to

€173.16m for Budget 2014.

***Draft Budget 2015 v Budget 2014:***

**The priorities for 2015 for this Council include:**

 The desire to maintain essential services.

 The need to limit cost increases to the users of our services.

 The need to continue a strategic programme of investment and development

of the City and County.

 The need to match spending programmes with resources.

 To recognise the fact that the economy is still in recovery.

 The need to support regeneration proposals for disadvantaged areas of

Limerick.

 The need to plan for new customer service initiatives.

 The introduction of the new rates revaluation process for Limerick City and

County.

 Providing funds in preparation of Limerick’s bid for European Capital of

Culture 2020.

 Adoption of a General Municipal Allocation of €1.5m.

**Payroll**

The staffing level of the new local authority shows considerable change over the last

number of years. Back in 2008, between Limerick City and County Councils, there

was a staffing WTE complement of 1373. In September of 2014, this figure had

dropped to 1109, a reduction of 264 staff or 19 per cent. With this in mind, the

current work of the Change Team to help create and develop a newer, better, fit-for-

purpose local authority that will ensure that we all meet the challenges that lie ahead,

is now more critical than ever. This work will be ongoing throughout 2015. This must

be supported by the full implementation of the Performance Management and

Development System (PMDS). To continue to minimise the payroll costs in 2015

and to comply with the Government Directive to reduce payroll costs, a number of

measures have been reflected in the Budget for 2015. These include the non

renewal of temporary contracts, non filling of vacancies except where health and

safety issues require same. It should be noted that the Gateway Programme for

Limerick had 108 participants partaking of the scheme at the end of 2014. This

scheme has proved extremely successful and has given the participants a platform

for their hard work and skills whilst at the same time providing great assistance to the

Council in the rolling out of its work programme. A sum of €130,000 has been

provided in the Budget for to support the recruitment of graduates under the recently

announced Public Sector Graduate Recruitment Programme.

**Non-Payroll Costs**

There are a number of non-payroll costs and unavoidable increases in current costs

facing Limerick City and County Council in 2015. I have made all possible efforts to

maintain expenditure in critical service delivery areas. Limerick City and County

Council is making great strides in order to ensure value for money across the

organisation. The Council is participating in national tenders in areas such as

electricity, mobiles, stationery, furniture, paper, gas and bulk fuels and has recently

completed a successful tender for the provision of legal services. The Council is also

actively involved in using national procurement systems such as LAQuotes and e-

Tenders in efforts to further curtail non-payroll costs. Procurement will be a constant

focus in our efforts to achieve value for money throughout 2015.

**Local Property Tax and NPPR**

Due to the introduction of the Property Tax, NPPR is not payable in 2015. 2015 is

significant in that funding for local authorities is now being sourced, no longer from

the Local Government Fund but from the recently introduced Local Property Tax.

Members were granted authority to determine the amount payable by citizens plus or

minus 15% within their administrative area. The Department had advised us of the

amount we were likely to receive and the indication given was that the Council would

be availing of the equalisation fund of 20% and could expect an amount of central

funding similar to the General Purpose Grant received in 2014. Resulting from a

Council Meeting in September 2014, Circular Fin. 17/2014 stated that, as the Council

has notified the Minister of the passing of a resolution to vary the basic rate of local

property tax downwards by 3% for 2015, this will have the effect of reducing the

amount of the provisional 2015 LPT allocation to €14,139,276 (a reduction of

€485,883 from the original allocation of €14,625,159 pre-variation).

**Commercial Rates**

Limerick City and County Council, as a combined Authority, had a rate demand in

2014 of €53.668m compared to a figure in 2008 of €55.607m. This indicates a

reduction of €2m or 3.5%. However, the change is far more stark in the recent past

i.e. from 2014 to 2012 in that whilst the rate demand peaked in 2012 (€59.276m),

significant reductions, especially to the City demand, have seen total rates billed

decrease to €53.667m. This represents a drop of €5.6m, (9.4%) in the 3 year period.

Along with parking, this makes Limerick the most cost effective location in order to

do business in within this country.

This unprecedented reduction in rates, particularly in 2014, has helped stimulate the

local economy and highlighted the commitment of the Council to businesses in order

to generate employment and create an environment for continued growth and

prosperity.

**Irish Water**

In 2014, due to changes in the provision of goods, the Council substantially reduced

its own expenditure as regards non-payroll costs for the provision of water services.

This has resulted in a reduced budgeted expenditure and recoupment from Irish

Water in our 2015 Budget. We have had a number of meetings with Irish Water in

order to review and discuss our Service Level Agreement and expenditure

commitments for 2015.

**Capital Budget 2015-2017**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act, 2001, amended by the

Local Government Reform Act, 2014, please find attached a report on the

programme of capital projects proposed by Limerick City and County Council for the

3 years 2015 to 2017. Given the fact that we are proposing allocations over 3 years,

it would be unrealistic to suggest that these allocations are definitive and are subject

to funding being available in future years. Capital projects by their very nature are

flexible rolling plans which involve an annual review and possible adjustment.

The circumstances in which capital projects operate have changed. As you are

aware, funding from Central Government has fallen in the last number of years and

also we have seen a sharp decline in the amount of development contribution levies.

However, we have to be mindful of our commitment and determination as regards

the 2030 Plan and our need to ensure the local economy grows and develops. With

this focus and vision, in 2014 the Council Members agreed to the raising of a loan for

Certain key projects are subject to Central Government approval and this approval is

key in order to proceed. The projected cost of capital projects is based on current

information available and is subject to change.

I request the Members to consider the Capital Budget report as part of the budgetary

process.

**Conclusion**

It is a great source of pride and pleasure for me that in 2014 Limerick City and

County Council won the overall accolade of Local Authority of the Year. This award

is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the staff of Limerick City and

County Council and the recognition from the business community of all that we have

achieved to date in a relatively short period of time.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and the Council Members for

their assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy

Group, in preparing this Budget. I also wish to express my appreciation to the

Management Team and their own teams for their commitment and hard work in

preparing this document. I also want to acknowledge and thank Members and staff

who retired during the year and also to remember all associated with the Council

who sadly passed away in 2014.

I look forward to the full support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to

be held at 2.30pm on Monday, 12th January, 2015.”

The Mayor stated that a PowerPoint presentation would be delivered by the Head of

Finance, Directors of Service and Senior Officials of the Council on the Draft Budget

for 2015. He stated that, on conclusion of the presentation, it was proposed that the

Party Leaders would speak and then each of the eight Divisions would be dealt with

in turn where questions would be taken on each Division before moving onto the

next Division.

The PowerPoint presentation was delivered under the following headings:

• Background to the Budget/Macro Environment.

• Comparison with Previous Years.

• Analysis of Income/Expenditure.

• Capital Account Summary.

• Budget Provision for each of the eight Service Divisions of the Council.

Presentation by Party Leaders at Council Budget Meeting 2015

Councillor Collins (M) welcomed the fact that there was no proposed increase in the

commercial rate for 2015 but expressed his dissatisfaction at the proposal to change

the rates rebate for unoccupied premises whereby the property owners who were

unable to rent their premises would have to pay 50% of the rates.

When referring to Housing, he stated that the provision of additional units was

particularly welcome and that the continuation of housing adaptation grants by way

of support from the Department was also welcome.

In reference to Roads, he stated that the non-national roads continued to fall into

disrepair due to reduced national funding and a reduction in outdoor staff resulting

from staff embargos.

Under Environment, he stated that it was important to highlight the support of local

housing committees and voluntary groups for grass cutting and litter clean-ups.

Regarding the new proposed bin waiver scheme, he was seeking an increased

allocation to reflect the previous year’s spend.

He further requested a fair and equitable distribution between the City and the

County of allocations towards the cost of Christmas lighting. He proposed the

acceptance of the allocation of €108,000 for public lighting with a scheme for

distribution of the funds to be devised at a later stage.

Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that this was the first budget for the new amalgamated

authority of Limerick City and County. He complimented the staff who had adapted

to the change over the previous 2 years. He stated that the way of doing business

had changed since the Local Authority had the ability to raise funds through the

Local Property Tax.

He said that as a result of the Council voting to reduce charges on LPT by 3%, this

would cost the Council some €485,000. He stated that the introduction of the 50%

levy on vacant properties was unacceptable. He welcomed the fact that the

commercial rate would be maintained at the same level as the previous year.
---
**14**

From a Housing perspective, he welcomed the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)

Pilot Scheme in Limerick and further stated that housing on the cheap did not work

and that entitlement to a home for life should be a given. He also welcomed the fact

that the Council was moving back towards building social housing.

Regarding Development Management, he stated that economic development was

becoming more the responsibility of the Local Authority than in the past and that this

was to be welcomed. He was calling on the Chief Executive to apportion adequate

funds to kick-start rural development in the three Municipal Districts.

Regarding Environment Services, he stated that landfill services at Gortadroma had

ceased and raised a query as to how the aftercare fund operated. He added that the

absence of a subsidy scheme for refuse collection charges was unacceptable. He

said that the cost of litter management was still too high and welcomed the Gateway

initiative to subsidise this.

He then referred to the great year Limerick had had as the City of Culture 2014. He

said that it was incumbent on the Council to build on that.

Councillor Quinlivan stated that he was opposed to the imposition of LPT on Council

tenants. He pointed out that Council tenants were not property owners and that the

Council as landlords should have to pay the tax. He added that the charge was a

blanket levy that took no account of ability to pay.

Regarding Roads, he welcomed the fact that the roads budget had been protected

and that there was a focus on bridges.

He asked for clarification on the 50% rates provision in relation to vacant properties,

for extension of the Schools’ Meals Initiative to county areas and for the retention of

the Bin Waiver Scheme.

Councillor Prendiville stated that the Local Government Fund for Limerick had been

reduced significantly and, in addition, that there had been cuts in special grants for

roads and other services. He singled out the imposition of an €87 charge on Council

tenants to pay the Property Tax and cuts in the bin waiver for particular criticism.

He expressed concern in relation to the Council’s participation in the Gateway Jobs

Initiative and also disappointment that no provision had been made in the Budget for

the Community Horse Stables project. He concluded by saying that he would not be

supporting the Budget.

Councillor Leddin acknowledged the historic nature of the occasion and thanked the

Chief Executive and staff for the huge effort made in the preparation of the Draft

Budget. He said that he had serious concerns in relation to the imposition of the LPT

on local authority tenants and with the amount set aside for the Bin Waiver Scheme.

The reduction in staff numbers year on year was highlighted as a problem and

something that would need to be addressed going forward.

Councillor Leddin welcomed and praised the significant budget allocated to

Regeneration; the huge contribution of the Council in Recreation and Sports and the

maintenance of commercial rates at the 2014 level which would help to stimulate the

local economy. He highlighted that this demonstrated the commitment of the Council

to businesses to help generate employment and create an environment for continued

growth and prosperity.

Councillor Gilligan stated that one of the biggest problems facing the economy was

the low level of investment in jobs. He criticised plans for a new footbridge in

Limerick City and asked for further detail in relation to same. He said he was totally

opposed to increasing the rents on local authority tenants and would not support the

Budget if the liability for LPT was passed onto the Council tenants. He also opposed

any change to the bin waiver system.

It was pointed out that to agree a Budget of €155.87m was a very difficult task and

the Chief Executive, the Head of Finance, his staff and all Departments involved in

the process were complimented.

The following aspects of the Budget were welcomed by the Members:

• No increase in the commercial rate for 2015.

• Proposal to provide additional new housing units as part of the new

Government Housing Strategy.

• The continuation of housing adaptation grants and energy efficiency initiative.

• The ongoing commitment to regeneration and the approval of the Limerick

Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan.

• The ongoing commitment by Limerick City and County Council to invest in the

City which should attract new businesses.

• The allocation for roads.

• The Council’s interest in economic development.

• The Gateway Initiative.

• The provision in the Roads Budget for work to bridges.

• Arts Programme and bid for European Capital of Culture.

Dissatisfaction was expressed by the Members at the following:

• Proposal to change the rates rebate affecting unoccupied commercial

properties imposing a charge of 50% of the rates.

• Reduced national funding for roads and the reduction in outdoor staff resulting

in non-national roads falling into further disrepair.

• The new proposed bin waiver scheme.

• The ongoing high cost of litter management.

• Further cuts in Local Government funding.

• The imposition of an €87 Property Tax charge on Council tenants.

• Elimination of funding for weed control of footpaths.

• Cut in spending on derelict sites.

• No provision made for the Community Horse Stables Project.

Members praised the support of local housing committees and voluntary groups who

continued to do fantastic work by way of grass cutting and litter clean-ups.

On the proposal of Councillor Galvin, seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, it was agreed

to adjourn the Meeting for 15 minutes to allow for further discussion on the Budget.

**Suspension of Standing Orders**: It was also agreed, on the proposal of Councillor

Galvin, seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, that Standing Orders would be suspended

in order to complete the Agenda.

On resumption of the Meeting, it was agreed to proceed with consideration and

questions under the various Divisions.
---
**17**

**Division A - Housing & Building**

The Director of Home and Social Development explained that the increase in the

rents figure included in the Budget was as a result of the Housing Assistance

Payment and was not associated with any rent increase for Council tenants.

In relation to Local Property Tax (LPT) and liability for same, she confirmed that the

Council intended to recoup this money from tenants by way of a charge on their rent

and that provision had been made in the Draft Budget for an amount of €450,000.

She explained that the imposition of LPT on Council housing tenants had been

agreed as part of last year’s Budget but explained that, for a number of reasons, it

had not been possible to levy and collect the charge in 2014.

The breakdown for the Housing Adaptation Grants was noted and clarification was

provided on the level of funding available for 2015 which was in the region of €3

million.

It was confirmed to the Members that expenditure in relation to Housing Assistance

Payment (HAP) was 100% recoupable from the Department.

The Director responded to further queries in relation to the Maintenance and

Improvement of Housing Stock; Energy Efficiency and Adaptations Works and

Insurance Costs.

With the Mayor’s permission, it was agreed to take Divisions B and C together.

**Division B - Road Transportation and Safety / Division C - Water Services**

The Director of Travel and Transportation stated that it was expected to receive

information in relation to the Local Improvement/Community Involvement Schemes

early in 2015.

The Members were updated on the Part 8 process for Parnell and Davis Street.

The Director informed the Meeting that the issue of Traffic Calming would be

considered by the Strategic Policy Committee in due course. He added that the

National Roads Authority would be contacted in relation to repair and maintenance of

footpaths on National Roads.
---
**18**

The Director confirmed that Public Lighting was funded fully from the Council’s Own

Resources and that the Council would need to investigate new technologies in this

area in terms of energy efficiencies.

The Director replied to further queries in relation to a number of road projects,

procurement for public lighting and Smarter Travel.

**Division D - Development Management**

Regarding staffing, the Director of Economic Development and Planning advised that

two staff had been re-assigned to the Economic Development and Planning

Directorate to work on E.U. Projects.

Members praised the Business and Retail Incentive Scheme and asked if it could be

expanded in 2015 to other areas in the County.

Members expressed concern in relation to the level of funding provided for grass

cutting in estates. Members acknowledged the work of local voluntary groups and

asked if more funding could be provided in this area. Reference was made to the

number of estates (36) that had been taken-in-charge in 2014 and the extra pressure

that this would place on the Council in relation to grass cutting. In response, the

Director stated that the use of Development Levy Funds could be looked at for use in

this area.

At this point, the Deputy Mayor took the Chair as the Mayor had to leave the

Chamber for a short time.

The Members were appraised on the ‘Living Cities Initiative’. In response to queries,

the Director responded that the Initiative was targeted at families who wanted to

renovate pre-1914 city centre properties for family use. He added that the Initiative

was currently with the European Commission awaiting approval.

In response to a query regarding the Arthur’s Quay Compulsory Purchase Order, the

Director stated that the CPO was to acquire river front land which was still in the

ownership of the Office of Public Works.

Some Members expressed disappointment in relation to the level of funding provided

for Tourism Development and Promotion.
---
**19**

Councillor Hourigan proposed that an audit of all housing estates not yet taken-in -

charge be undertaken by the Council. He added that the estates should be listed in

the order in which they were built and that they should also be taken-in-charge in this

order. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J) and agreed.

Councillor Browne proposed the expansion of the Business and Retail Incentive

Scheme to other areas in the County. This proposal was seconded by Councillor

Sheehy and agreed.

At this point, the Mayor returned to the Chamber and took the Chair.

The Director referred to other areas within the Division, including redevelopment of

the Hanging Gardens’ Site; Opera Site; proposed footbridge for the City; Mungret

College Redevelopment; Cleeves; Innovate Limerick and the Andersen Plant.

With the Mayor’s permission, it was agreed to take Divisions E, F and G together.

**Division E - Environmental Services / Division F - Recreation and Amenity /**

**Division G - Agriculture, Education, Health and Welfare**

The Director of Environment and Water, in response to concerns about the level of

funding provided for the Control of Horses, stated that the Department of Agriculture

had advised of a further reduction in funding for the service in 2015. He confirmed

that the average cost for impounding a horse was €1,000.00 and that, for 2015, the

amount recoupable from the Department had been reduced to €315.00. He added

that a review was taking place on the legislation governing this area.

A lengthy discussion took place on this item with a large number of Members stating

that this was a matter for the Department of Agriculture and that the Council should

not be expected to fund expenditure in this area from its Own Resources.

Councillor Browne proposed a reduction in the provision made for Control of Horses

so that additional funding could be provided under the School Meals Code. He

proposed the expansion of the School Meals Code to include some of the County

areas. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Sheehy.

It was agreed that if the Council’s bid for the title of European National City of Culture

was unsuccessful, the allocation provided of €600,000 could be re-allocated to

Tourism.

In response to queries and concerns regarding the introduction of a new Bin Waiver

Scheme, the Chief Executive stated that it was difficult to give further detail on the

proposed Scheme at this stage and that further work needed to be done on the

Executive side.

The Director of Environment agreed to revert to the Members in relation to questions

raised regarding Abattoirs.

The Director also responded to queries in relation to the landfill operation and

aftercare; recovery and recycling facilities operations; litter management; Tidy Towns

and Cemetery Services.

At this point, it was agreed that the Meeting would adjourn for 30 minutes to allow

the Chief Executive and the Management Team to consider some of the issues

which had been discussed. It was also agreed that the Chief Executive would meet

with each of the Party Leaders during the adjournment to discuss any proposed

changes to the Draft Budget.

When the Meeting reconvened, the Mayor called on the Chief Executive to speak.

The Chief Executive stated that he had considered carefully the views expressed by

the Members and that the following was the Council’s position:

• In relation to the rates on vacant premises, it was proposed to vary the level of

rates refunds on vacant properties in all Local Electoral Areas within the

administrative area of the City and County of Limerick to 25% for the financial

year ending 31st December, 2015.

• He proposed the introduction of a ‘Business Support Programme’ to encourage

the continued beneficial use of commercial property in line with the following

categories –

-

For properties with a liability of rates €0 to €2,499, a grant equivalent to 75%,

resulting in an effective 100% refund of rates.

-

For properties with a liability of rates €2,500 to €9,999, a grant equivalent to

25%, resulting in an effective 50% refund of rates.

-

For properties with a liability of rates €10,000 +, no grant.

• He confirmed that there would be no change to the imposition of LPT on the

Council’s housing tenants as requested by the Members.

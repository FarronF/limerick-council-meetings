Proposed by Councillor Keary:
Seconded by Councillor O'Donoghue;
And Resolved:

“That, the draft Minutes, as circulated, be taken as read and adopted and signed."

Councillor Keary referred to Item 3 (b) in the Minutes in relation to the proposal to extend
the life of the Croom Local Area Plan 2009-2015 and raised concerns regarding the
location of a new secondary school in Croom. A lengthy discussion ensued on the most
suitable location for a secondary school in Croom either on the existing school site or on a
site in Skagh on the outskirts of town. Councillor O'Donoghue expressed a view that the
school should be located closer to the town centre.

The Senior Executive Planner indicated that provision had been made in the Local Area
Plan for the expansion of the secondary school in situ and further stated that there was
sufficient land zoned within the town to accommodate the new school. A report was
circulated at the last Municipal District Meeting outlining that there was sufficient land
zoned in the current Local Area Plan for Croom and a resolution was passed to extend the
existing Local Area Plan.

2. Environment and Water

Gortadroma Landfill

updated lease and that discussions were ongoing. He further stated that a Meeting was

3. Economic Development and Planning
(a) Proposed Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021

The land referred to in Submissions 27-30

The land referred to in Submissions 27-30 was discussed by the Members. Members
expressed concern at the proposal to rezone these lands as Open Space and Recreation.
It was noted that this represented a change from the current zoning of the 2009 Local Area
Plan and from the previous 2002 Local Area Plan.

Members felt that rezoning these lands Open Space and Recreation was pre-mature as
only preliminary OPW CFRAM maps were available. Members stated that local
information indicated that these lands had not flooded in the last 40 years. Members
voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of up-to-date information on CFRAM maps and
stated that they did not have all the facts before them today. Members felt they could not
make accurate decisions based on the preliminary information provided.

The Senior Executive Planner indicated that the reason for the change in zoning was that,
according to the JBA flood risk assessment maps, the entire site was now considered to
have a greater than 1:100 chance of an annual flood event. The Council had taken the
precautionary approach and had not zoned land for development where potential risk of
flooding had been identified. She further stated that the final OPW CFRAM maps would
be available in 2015 and when the final CERAM maps became available, the Local Area
Plan could be amended if there were significant discrepancies.

Councillor O'Brien proposed that the land referred to in Submissions 27-30 be zoned
Residential Phase 2. He proposed the change in zoning of these lands as the land had
never flooded and the datum levels were significantly higher than the lands adjoining
Station Road. There would be no impact on the core strategy as phase one lands must be
developed first. The proposal was seconded by Councillor O'Donoghue.

As Councillor O'Brien's proposal represented an amendment to the Local Area Plan
currently before the Municipal District for approval and in the absence of agreement, the
Meetings Administrator indicated that a vote would be taken.

The Meetings Administrator clarified that a vote would be taken to make the Plan with
Amendment proposed by Councillor O'Brien.

The result of the voting was as follows:

For the Amendment:
Councillors Keary, McMahon, Neville, O'Brien, O'Donoghue and Sheahan. (6)
The Meeting Administrator declared that the amendment was carried.

It was noted that the proposed Local Area Plan would go on public display for a further 4
weeks giving members of the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed
amendments only. This would be followed by the preparation of a second Chief Executive
Report to the Members on any submissions received on the proposed amendments.

A discussion took place in relation to Submission 6. Councillor Sheehan queried if a new
flood impact report had been submitted and if the concerns in relation to flooding had been
addressed.

The Senior Executive Planner indicated that the serious concerns in relation to the risk of
flooding at this location still applied.

Members expressed the view that they would accept the advice of the Executive on the
proposal as stated in the Chief Executive's Report dated 4" November, 2014 as up-to-date
CFRAM maps were not available.

Proposed by Councillor Neville
Seconded by Councillor O’Brien
And Resolved:

“That, the Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021 be made in accordance with the Chief
Executive's recommendations dated 4"° November, 2014, subject to the land referred to in
Submissions 27-30 being zoned Residential Phase 2 and amendments agreed at the
Municipal District Meeting on the 11th November, 2014 (outlined below) under Section
20(3)(n) of the Planning and Development Acts, 2000-2014.”

“(i). 4In_relation to submission no 16, 17 and 178 the land at The

thatched Cottage, Main St Adare in relation to change of use from residential
to commercial and/or dual use remove objective H4(c) and objective (EH 1)
and any other text in the plan that refers to prohibiting the change of use of
thatched cottages from residential to commercial / dual use for the following
reasons

a. In relation to section 4.4 of the proposed Adare LAP 2015 - 2021 it states it
is important that the existing thatched buildings are retained and maintained.
In contravention to objective EH1 and objective EH4(c) of the plan the most
appropriate way of maintaining these buildings is allowing their use for
commercial or dual purposes. At present these dwellings not in commercial
use are derelict and do not fulfil modern residential demands, facilities or
size. The continuation of current residential zoning will compound and

(ii).

4

elongate the dereliction which contradicts the rationale for zoning them
residential in the first place. For this reason the removal of objective H4(c)
and EH 1 and any other text in the plan that refers to prohibiting the change of
use of thatched cottages from residential to commercial / dual use is
required.

4. Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 states that these cottages are the villages unique
selling point and a must see location. This attracts volumes of tourists to
these cottages. They take photographs/videos and also visit thatched
cottages which are already in commercial use. The privacy implications for
proposed residents of these dwellings due their photographic attraction
stifles demand for their use as a home.

c. As stated in Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 these cottages are a must see. If they
remain zoned residential they will remain derelict with proprietors unable to
afford their upkeep and thus threaten their very character. Also as they are a
must see attraction, zoning these cottages commercial/dual will give the
public an opportunity to see their inside decor as well as the outside
character. This will crystallize their unique selling point of the village.

d. Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 states there are to be no installation of satellite
dishes or aerials on the cottages. When acquiring a modern home satellite
dishes and aerials are now the norm. This again emphasises that these
cottages will not be in demand or suitable as modern residential housing.

e. Section 8.2.3 A.C.A 2 states that incompatible changes of use or proposals
for dual residential/commercial/office use are a threat to the thatched
cottages. Again this is not the case due to the reasons outlined in (a) (b) (c)
above.

f. The use of signage for commercial purposes will be allowed on a
reasonable basis in keeping with the existing commercial activity already in
use by some of these thatched cottages.

g. Allowing commercial activity in these thatched cottages will help create
local sustainable employment thus adding to Adare's unique selling point -
Tourism.

In relation to submission no 27 the zoning of lands at Deerpark shall be
changed to residential — phase 2 and residential serviced sites — phase 2 as
indicated on the attached map (Councillor Neville submitted map outlining the
proposed site and this map is attached). The following objective shall be
included in Chapter 8 of the proposed plan:

Objective EH10: Trees on lands at Deerpark

There are a significant proportion of existing trees on the land zoned as
phase 2 residential and phase 2 serviced sites at Deepark. Any future
development on these lands shall incorporate as many of the trees as
possible into the scheme. A comprehensive tree survey carried out by a

suitably qualified person shall be submitted with any future planning
application. -

Tables 3.4 and 10.1 to be amended accordingly

Reasons

It will provide more of a variety of sites given that a significant area of land in
Adare is indicated as liable to flooding and having regard to the amount of
land that has been de-zoned.

This will not affect the population targets set out in the core strategy as the
land is proposed as phase 2.

It is considered that this change is not significant in terms of SEA/AA
requirements particularly having regard to the inclusion of Objective EH10 in
relation to the trees.

In_relation to submission no 37 the land at Islandea, Adare shall be
changed to existing residential.

Reasons
These lands form the curtilage of the existing house.
The lands were previously zoned residential in the 2009 LAP.

Any application on this site would require compliance with Objective IN5
Flood Risk Management of the proposed plan in relation to flood risk

assessment.

In_relation to lands connecting Deerpark, Adare and the Rathkeale

Road, Adare that the portion thereof currently occupied and controlled by
Adare Soccer Club be rezoned from Residential Development Area Phase 1 to
Open Space and Recreation;

Reasons

Adare Soccer Club has occupied and controlled the aforesaid portion of
ground, delineated as the soccer club grounds, in excess of 20 years and it
would be contrary to proper planning to continue to zone this as Residential
Development Area Phase 1.

It is the objective of the Council to seek the provision of well designed,
accessible and high quality and useable open space in all residential
development in accordance with the County Development Plan and the
zoning of Adare Soccer Club portion of ground at Deerpark from Residential
Development Area Phase 1 to Open Space compliments these guidelines.

¢ The Adare Area Plan has zoned 34.54 hectares as Residential Development
Area Phase 1 and 13.66 hectares Residential Development Area Phase 2.
Accordingly the Adare Area Plan currently has land zoned that is expected to
meet the population target for the proposed plan period.”

Circulated, report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning dated 25”
November, 2014, enclosing copy of the Chief Executive’s Report to Members dated 25”

The Chief Executive's Report presented the submissions made following publication of the
proposed Askeaton Local Area Plan 2015-2021 and set out the Chief Executive’s
responses to the issues raised and any amendments to the proposed Local Area Plan. It
was noted that the proposed Plan was placed on public display from Saturday, 4”
October, 2014, to Monday, 17" November, 2014, inclusive and that a total of 11 written
submissions were received within the statutory timeframe. One submission was submitted
outside the statutory public display period. The formal making of the Local Area Plan was
by resolution of the Municipal Council Members. During the Local Area Plan process, the
Members must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,
statutory obligations and any relevant plans and policies of the Government or any
Minister of the Government.

The Senior Executive Planner outlined the procedure to be adhered to following receipt of
the Chief Executive's Report, including the making of amendments which would constitute
material alterations to the proposed Plan.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan;
Seconded by Councillor O'Brien;
And Resolved:

Executive's recommendations dated 25" November, 2014, under Section 20(3)(n) of the
Planning and Development Acts, 2000-2014."

The Senior Executive Planner indicated that written submissions with respect to the

QUESTIONS

6. Question submitted by Councillors T. Neville and E. O’Brien

We will ask at the next Meeting if lights were to be erected along the entrances to
Rathkeale from the N21 when this road was originally built. If so, how many lights
were to be erected; and what was the rationale for not erecting them.

REPLY: Rathkeale Bypass was built over 20 years ago. The original drawings for the
scheme have been inspected and show no provision for public lighting. No
other junctions on the N21 have public lighting.

Councillor Neville stated that this was a highly dangerous road and requested that lighting
be erected at the junction between Adare and Croagh and at Sweeeney’s Cross to Adare.
Councillor O’Brien queried if there was a policy on street lighting.

In response the Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, indicated that there was no
discretional funding for public lighting.

7. Question submitted by Councillor T. Neville

! will ask at the next Meeting if the sale of the former Anderson Ireland facility in
Rathkeale to Limerick City and County Council is fully complete. Can they outline
the sales process and state who were the stakeholders involved in influencing the

process.

REPLY: The Anderson facility in Rathkeale has been bought by Hospital Food Units,
trading as Innovate Limerick (a wholly owned Limerick City & County Council
company) from Bank of Scotland, Ireland.

The sale was negotiated directly with the Receiver for the Bank, Price
Waterhouse Coopers, by staff members of Innovate Limerick.
The local elected representatives have been briefed on this initiative.

NOTICE OF MOTION

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council take in charge
Ballyvareen Estate, Kildimo and An Curran Estate, Pallaskenry.

Councillor O'Brien, in proposing the Motion, stated that these estates should be taken in
charge. He highlighted the issue of the lack of street lighting in these estates and stated
that they were, therefore, unsafe.

have the outstanding works completed, we are awaiting
a response from Bank.

QUESTIONS
4. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting for a progress report on the up to date position
with regard to the removal of trees impeding the sightline at the exit from
Hawthorne Estate, Ballyagran, and provision of signage for Ballyagran from
R520 (Bruff Line).

REPLY: The boughs of the trees impeding the sightline at the entrance to the
Hawthorne Estate have now been removed. This has improved the
sightline at this location and no further removal of trees will improve the
sightlines further. There is an old roadside shed immediately adjacent to
the trees which may impede sightlines somewhat. We are not in a position
to remove this shed. To install a footpath at this location will involve the
removal of the tree immediately adjacent to the shed. We are in
discussions with the residents group in relation to this matter.

A sign for Ballyagran from the R520 (Bruff Line) will be ordered and
erected on delivery.

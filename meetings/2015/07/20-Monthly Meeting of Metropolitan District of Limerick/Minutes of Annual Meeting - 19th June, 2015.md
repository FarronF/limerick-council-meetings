The outgoing Mayor gave the following address to the meeting:

“*Looking back at the past year and reflecting on my term as the first Mayor of the new*

*Metropolitan District of Limerick, and looking out at the same time at the majestic River*

*Shannon from this most lovely chamber, I can safely say that pardon the pun, my term*

*has been one of ebbs and flows-more positive flows than negative ebbs !*

*The highlights of the year were many, some of which I will refer to as I address you. In*

*my opening address in this same venue here on the 16th of June just one year ago, I*

*referred to the fact that we had forgotten to remember past Great Limerick Women of*

*Distinction when it came to honouring achievement. To rectify this imbalance I put*

*forward the names of three Limerick Women of Achievement - namely Kate O Brien,*

*Charlotte Grace O Brien and Sophie Mary Pierce for special recognition and felt so*

*proud when Limerick Council and University of Limerick collaborated to honour the*

*three women in a wonderful event in the University of Limerick on International* *Women’s*

*Day, an event which was further added to by the presence of Sabina Higgins, wife of our*

*President Michael D. In this regard I would like to say a big 'thank you' to our own Liz*

*Creamer here in City Hall and U.L's Marie Connolly for the most professional and*

*effective manner in which they jointly organised the wonderful event.*

*The*

*other*

*major*

*highlights for*

*me*

*were meeting*

*with*

*so*

*many community*

*individuals, groups and organisations, the vast majority of whom are volunteer*

*dominated. To you volunteers and you organisations I say many thanks for your*

*unselfishness, humanity and dedication to the many people and organisations that you*

*have given and continue to give long hours of unselfish service to.*

*In this regard I would also like to pay tribute to all the emergency services and in*

*particular the Garda Síochána for their devotion to duty in pursuit of making Limerick a*

*better and safer place for all.*

*We dealt with many positive programmes of work to enhance the future development of*

*our city here in the Chamber, the results of which will bear fruit over the next couple of*

*years, and thus make our city and region a better place in which to live, work and to visit.*

*But in looking towards and developing the new, we must not do so in unseemly haste in*

*a way that sets aside or removes the best traditions of our historic city past. I would*

*urge officials at the top level of our organisation to engage in an open manner with*

*public representatives so that valued traditions of our old city past are continued and*

*enhanced and become complimentary to the wonderful plans for our newly developing*

*city and region.*

*I would like to thank all the officials whom I came in contact with and who were all most*

*helpful to me and most respectful of the office which I held.*

*Personally, I owe a genuine and great debt of gratitude to my secretary of the past*

*twelve months, Siobhan Carroll. Her advice, work ethic, professionalism and*

*knowledge of the workings of my office were invaluable to me.*

*To you my fellow councillors I say 'thank you' for the respect you have shown to me at*

*all times especially while conducting business here in the Chamber but also when acting*

*as Deputy Mayors on my behalf. In this regard I wish to pay special tribute to Cllr. Maria*

*Byrne who was superb in her role as Deputy Mayor.*

*Lastly but most importantly, to my family I say I really appreciate all the sacrifices you*

*have made on my behalf, not just during the past year but since I was first elected as a*

*public representative over six years ago. Without your help I could not have made it this*

*far.*

*In conclusion I leave this most historic office proud of the fact that I was the first public*

*representative to be elected Mayor of the new Metropolitan District of Limerick*

*representing a tradition going back over 900 years. I sincerely hope that I have*

*represented my office, you and the good people of Limerick, not just with pride, but most*

*importantly, with honour and with* *dignity”.*

*Our first new Metro Council of last year saw many challenges and I'd like to thank*

*Councillor Michael Sheahan for all his work. As Metropolitan Mayor I feel the position*

*should rise above any party politics. I will strive to be fair and impartial and my sincere*

*hope is that we will work diligently with the common goal of improving the quality of life*

*of all our citizens. The second year of this council I intend to be businesslike,*

*democratic and efficient with agenda items relevant to the improvement of our fine city.*

*Somebody asked me recently that if elected what would be my vision for the* *city.*

*I’**m* *afraid the vision I have will take much more than a year to achieve but that's no*

*reason not to start! I would love to see Limerick continue to grow into a fine modern city*

*but maintaining a palpable consciousness of its proud history. We have so much to*

*offer. I want to see inward tourism grow and prosper.*

*As a member of the board of governors of our fine University, led by Professor Don*

*Barry, I would like to progress further integration and cooperation between the city and*

*U.L., LIT, LCAD, Mary Immaculate and all of our fine third level institutions. I would hope*

*we can continue to create a 'living city 'where families will want to live and students,*

*tourists and citizens will be happy to walk the streets in safety and small businesses will*

*feel it worthwhile to remain open after 5pm.*

*I see the role of the Metropolitan Mayor as the facilitator/coordinator for these ideas to*

*flourish. Look around you..it's already happening. The city of culture, the milk market,*

*smarter travel, the focus on the river Shannon, all examples of what we can achieve.*

*We have published many fine documents and plans for our city and last year the full*

*Council took* *a brave step in sanctioning over €30 million to advance these plans.* *Our*

*challenge now is to deliver on these plans for our citizens.*

*My last wish is for Limerick and the region to achieve more successes on the sporting*

*field. Our famous Thomond Park needs no further mention and the reopening of the*

*Marketsfield with the return of Limerick FC was a joy to behold and a great example of*

*what can be achieved when people work together. With a nervous Tipperary team*

*arriving on Sunday hopefully visitors and citizens will once again experience the*

*atmosphere of our proud and strong "sporting capital of Ireland"*

*Go raibh mile maith agat go leir**”**.*

Members congratulated the Mayor on his election and wished him well for the year

Travel and Transportation

The Acting Director, Travel and Transportation presented details of the Limerick Northern

Distributor Road which included the following:

 Overall scheme objectives and characteristics.

 Phase 1 – Coonagh to Knockalisheen Distributor Road

 Background information.

 Need for the scheme.

 Policy context, local / regional / national.

 Progress to date.

 Key elements.

 Existing and proposed layout.

 Road cross sections, structures, adverts and surface water attenuation.

 Phase 2 – Limerick Northern Distributor Road

 Study areas.

 Route options.

 Emerging preferred route corridor.

 Progress to date.

Members thanked the Acting Director, Travel and Transportation for his presentation and

the following points were made by Members in relation to same:

 That this was a good news story for the north side of the city and will be the key to

opening up Moyross and the Old Cratloe Road.

 That many people will be affected by the route, in particular residents of Parteen, and

it was important that residents groups be engaged with and plans made clear to

them.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Acting Director, Travel and

Transportation clarified the following:

Phase 1

 Will be built in stages but under one contract.

 The construction is planned to take place over thirteen months and any temporary

diversions will be short term and managed by the Council and the contractor.

 Seven companies had been pre-qualified at national level but it could be expected

that much of the materials and labour would be sourced locally and the social clause

would be included in the construction contract.

 Any proposals in relation to providing a pitch for Ballynanty Rovers would have to be

raised with the Property Department attached to the Economic Development and

Planning Directorate.
---
4

 200m of the Knockalisheen Road would be upgraded and the Cratloe Road would be

upgraded out to its bounds with Clare.

 The laying of sewerage pipes was included as part of the road construction contract.

Phase 2

 Extensive consultation had already taken place and would continue as emerging

design is developed. The timeframe for production of detailed design was within

twelve to eighteen months.

 There were no immediate plans to construct this phase but there was a priority to

identify and protect the corridor. This phase could be advanced in stages.

 Any plans will have to be approved by An Bord Pleanála and the project will then

await construction funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

 Clare County Council was the lead Authority for this phase but staff from Limerick

City and County Council were in place on a Steering Group for the project.

 Issues raised in relation to Lisnagry and Annacotty will be dealt with under the

emerging design.

 Variations to the Development Plans will be required to protect the route and

residents will be engaged with in relation to same.

The Mayor and Members welcomed students and teachers from Patrickswell National

School to the meeting.

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update as to whether the lands formerly***

***owned by Braddish & Co located at Ballykeefe have now been transferred to***

***Limerick City and County Council.***

**REPLY:**

A Draft Legal Agreement to acquire these lands from Mr. Braddish has

been prepared. There is an outstanding issue in relation to the access to

the land and discussions are ongoing in this regard.

7.

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update regarding the proposed use of lands***

***currently owned by the Council located on Carey's Road and formerly the site of a***

***Guinness Depot.***

**REPLY**:

This site was purchased by the Council in 2000. The site is zoned “City

Centre” on the current Development Plan. The site is being maintained

and is secured. The Home and Social Development Dept are currently

reviewing the suitability of all available Brownfield Sites within the City and

County, including this site.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will ask the next meeting if Limerick City and County Council would consider***
---
5

***giving Munster Rugby funding yearly to ensure all Munster Rugby training and***

***matches take place in Limerick, which would have massive economic benefits for***

***the city.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council acknowledges the contribution that

Munster Rugby has made to Limerick, not solely from just a sporting

sense, but also from a social and economic perspective. The Munster

team represents the whole province and as a private business entity it is a

decision for Munster Rugby as to where to hold training sessions and host

matches having regard to all their fans. Limerick City and County Council

will continue to support Munster Rugby’s commitment to Limerick.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council performs a survey of traffic flow***

***on the Dock Road to determine the reason for the recent congestion that is***

***occurring as the traffic approaches the roundabouts for the main routes out of the***

***city.***

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh indicated that traffic congestion on the

Dock Road commenced where the two lanes of traffic merge into one and continued

onto the Greenpark roundabout and that there were also delays, inbound, in the

mornings.

In seconding the motion Councillor Collins noted the increase in traffic arising in the

Mungret area and called for a traffic management plan for the area and improvements to

the road network, much of which was constructed as county roads and not intended for

the volume of traffic being carried.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the number of trucks using the Dock

Road that might avail of the tunnel if the toll fee was more reasonable.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council Travel and Transportation Department

carried out preliminary investigations of traffic flow and journey times on

the Dock Road R510 between its intersection with the N18 (J2) Bunlickey

Roundabout Interchange and the Shannon Bridge Roundabout R527

during the periods 8.00am to 9.00am and 5.00pm and 6.00pm, Monday to

Friday in May 2015. The route distance is 3.5km and the speed limit is

50km/h inbound from Bawneys bridge and 60km/h outbound from

Bawneys bridge. Summary analysis of the investigation is outlined below:

 The average outbound journey time between 5.00pm and 6.00pm is

8mins.

 The average inbound journey time between 8.00am and 9.00am is

9mins.

Peak hourly traffic flows at Bawneys Bridge is 1400 vehicles per hour in

the morning period and 1200 in the evening period.

Morning inbound traffic establishes sporadic vehicle queues from between

8.25am to 9.00am. Evening outbound traffic can sometimes establish a

persistent queue from 5.30pm to 6.10pm.
---
6

Analysis of the outbound flow patterns and queues indicate merging

difficulties some times for outbound traffic entering the Bunlickey

Roundabout. This roundabout can for periods become dominated by

traffic from Raheen using the roundabout to access the N18 dual

carriageway at Junction 2.

**Summary**

Currently journey times on this route are not considered excessive during

these rush hour periods. Some outbound queuing occurs in the evenings

for vehicles traversing the Bunlickey roundabout. However this queuing

does not warrant any special control provisions at this time. Poor lane

discipline can account for reduced “gap acceptance” being available for the

outbound traffic.

The Bunlickey Roundabouts are not in the charge of Limerick City and

County Council. This interchange is in the charge of the Limerick Tunnel

concessioner (Direct Route) until 2041. Any new or altered traffic

management provisions at this location would require the approval of the

National Transport Authority.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Acting Director, Travel and

Transportation clarified that prior to the construction of the tunnel there was a journey

time of one hour from Coonagh Cross to the far side of the N69 and that issues now

were created by traffic lights installed to facilitate access to the Dock Road from side

streets and by pedestrian crossings. In relation to the two large roundabouts that control

access to and exit from the N18, he stated that queue times were not excessive here but

if delays worsened it would be a matter for the NRA to build alternative junctions at

considerable costs.

Councillor Maria Byrne took the Chair at this point in the meeting.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council upgrade existing monuments in***

***the city and provide a display giving the history of those who rose to prominence***

***around the world.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Gilligan stressed the value of the history of the city to

tourism and the need to make its history clear for visitors. He called for the Wild Geese

Statue to be properly maintained, for works to be carried out to the Walls of Limerick at

the back of the Market and for the Statue of Patrick Sarsfield to be relocated to John’s

Square.

Members supported the motion and made the following additional points:

 The need for the 1916 Memorial on Sarsfield Bridge to be cleaned, the protective

railing repaired and the litter at the left hand side of the memorial to be removed.

 The need for an inventory of monuments in the city to be carried out to include a

report on the condition of each monument and any repair works needed.
---
7

 The need to map all monuments, historic sites and tourist attractions and provide

online information in relation to each such site, including a phone app. It was noted

that much of this information could be gathered from local historians or from

publications such as “Limerick You Don’t See” and that the relevant Strategic Policy

Committee could consider progressing same.

 The need to carry out works to ensure that the plaque at the Strand Hotel

commemorating the murdered Mayors was readily visible to the public.

 That Limerick Civic Trust should be consulted to establish if they could play a role in

maintaining monuments.

The Deputy CEO acknowledged the need to value and treasure our history. He noted

that the Statue of the Wild Geese had been damaged and repaired several times and

would be repaired again with more durable material. He undertook to review the 1916

memorial immediately and discuss the relocation of the Patrick Sarsfield Statue with the

Bishop of Limerick and revert to the Members. He also undertook to arrange for an

inventory and assessment of monuments and to discuss issues relating to the damage

to Limerick Boat Club with representatives of same.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Smarter Travel consider the***

***expansion of the successful public bike scheme to the suburbs to include areas***

***such as Raheen, Dooradoyle, Castletroy, Ennis Road and Mayorstone.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Leddin noted that the existing scheme was very

successful and queried as to whether a second phase was planned that would extend

the scheme to the suburbs where there were many workplaces and a large footfall that

could avail of same.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the potential of extending the scheme to

include, University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, the Crescent Shopping

Centre, the Raheen Industrial Estate, the Ennis Road, the National Technology Park and

Thomond Park and suggested that employers in these areas be requested to support

the bike scheme.

On the proposal of Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Collins, it was agreed

to suspend standing orders for thirty minutes to facilitate completion of the agenda.

Members noted that cycle lanes were in place to service Limerick City to Patrickswell

and Annacotty and these locations could also be served by the cycle scheme. It was

noted that pedestrians exiting Norwood on to the Childers Road exited directly on to the

cycle lane and it was suggested that the cycle lane at this location be swapped with the

adjacent footpath or warning signs erected.

**REPLY**:

The Public Bike Scheme is funded and managed by the National Transport

Authority (NTA). Limerick City and County Council has assisted the NTA

in the roll-out of this facility.

The sponsorship of the bikes and the contract for the maintenance of the

facility is a matter for the NTA.
---
8

In reply to queries raised by Members the Acting Director, Travel and Transportation

noted that the National Transport Authority (NTA) was responsible for the scheme and

three cities involved had requested an expansion of the scheme and met with the NTA in

relation to same. No funding had been allocated for any expansion in 2015 and an

application for funding in 2016 would be made. In relation to a report on usage of the

scheme, the Acting Director, Travel and Transportation noted that there was

considerable data available in relation to usage and suggested that a representative

from Smarter Travel attend at a future meeting to discuss same.

Mayor Sheahan resumed the Chair of the meeting at this point.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Michael Hourigan

***I move at the next meeting that a strategic plan be developed, in conjunction with***

***the community, to develop the LPYMA ground into an amenity that will benefit the***

***whole community and address ongoing issues such as antisocial behaviour. This***

***under-utilised resource to be maintained and secured while a long term plan is***

***brought forward.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Hourigan noted the neglected condition of this site,

the increase in antisocial behaviour on site, the need to secure the three entrances to

the site and the potential of the site, if properly developed and maintained, to be used by

local schools, clubs and the general community.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Butler highlighted the need to make the site

attractive for locals to use as a socially important, multi purpose area and the need to

develop a strategy for this site and the site at Vartry.

Members supported the motion and stressed the need for funding options for the

development of this and similar green areas to be identified.

**REPLY**:

The LPYMA grounds are currently being used by Shelbourne AFC. A

number of other sporting bodies have expressed an interest in these lands.

The Council will look at a long term plan for the facility and in this regard

will address the issues preventing its development which includes access

to the facility. We have been in touch with the Gardai regarding recent

anti-social activity at the grounds and they are monitoring the area.

The Deputy CEO informed Members that controlling access to the site would be

reviewed as would possible sources of funding to develop this site.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Michael Hourigan

***I move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council adopt the***

***recommendations outlined in the Natura Westfields Management Plan. As***

***required under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) that these wetlands be protected***

***for the wild life, before this amenity is lost to the city and local community.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hourigan and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hourigan noted that the Spring growth had taken

over a considerable portion of the wetland area and that, if left unchecked, by 2016 there

would be no need for the viewing stand as it would be covered in reed. He stressed the
---
9

need to protect the existing investment on the site which was frequently visited by local

schools and birdwatchers.

Members supported the motion and noted that the lake would be overgrown within five

years should the Natura recommendations not be carried out. Members also

acknowledged the costs associated with keeping the lake free of plant growth and

discussed the possibility of private enterprise assisting in this regard or identifying an

area that could be kept open, if some funding could be identified.

**REPLY**:

The Westfield Wetlands are part of the lower River Shannon Special Area

of Conservation (SAC).

The Natura Report for Westfields was prepared in 2001 and the main

recommendations at the time were as follows:

 Create open water bodies in the central and western sections.

 Excavate sediment from parts of the water body in the eastern section.

 Replace the existing water intake from the river with a sluice system.

 Open channels between the four sections of the wetland.

 Remove Japanese knotweed (*Fallopia japonica*).

 Employ a manager/guide.

Certain works were carried out a number of years ago. It would be

necessary for the Council to cost the implementation of these

recommendations. No provision has been made in the 2015 budget for

any works in Wetlands other than routine maintenance.

The full implementation of the works as outlined above will require a

significant specific resource provision by the Council in its budget for 2016.

Councillor Hourigan again stressed the importance of spending any funding that might

be available to remove the 2015 weed growth and the Meetings Administrator undertook

to raise the issue with the Environment Department and revert to the Members at the

next meeting.

On the proposal of Councillor Hourigan and seconded by Councillor O’Dea, it was

agreed to suspend standing orders to allow for the completion of the agenda.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, in***

***consultation with the Water Authority, extends the sewerage network out towards***

***Ballyclough. This area is only a few kilometres from Limerick's Main Drainage***

***and this extension will provide it with a realistic and sustainable alternative to***

***septic tanks.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

**REPLY**:

The Notice of Motion as submitted by Councillor Elena Secas should be

referred directly to Irish Water for response if the Notice of Motion is

adopted by Council.
---
10

Councillor Elena Secas has been contacted and advised of the telephone

number and email address designated by Irish Water for dealing with

public representatives. Telephone Number 1890178178 and email

address localrepsupport@water.ie.

The Meetings Administrator noted that the motion would be referred to Irish Water.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will move at the next Meeting that, starting with this year, Limerick City and***

***County Council issues an annual report on:***

***- how much Local Property Tax was collected in Limerick City;***

***- what percentage of the revenue raised was used to fund the provision of***

***services by Limerick City and County Council;***

***- what projects and in what areas of Limerick have been funded from the***

***LPT.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

**REPLY**:

As the collection of the Local Property Tax is now a Revenue Commission

function, it is not possible to give information on the actual amount

collected. However, as per Circular Fin17/2014, (copy of circular included

in Budget Book 2015) an amount of €14,139,276 has been included in the

Budget for the 2015 LPT allocation for Limerick City and County Council.

This amount equates to approximately 9% of the Council’s total Revenue

Income. As the LPT funds are consolidated into the Council’s general

funding it is not allocated to specific projects but used to part fund Council

activities for the year.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

***I will move at the next meeting that Corporate Headquarters, Merchants Quay, be***

***made available as a venue for the Civil Ceremony of Marriage.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan pointed out that cities all over the world use

their City Hall as a venue for the Civil Ceremony of Marriage and given the view over the

adjacent River Shannon and access to the garden, on site, this location would be of

benefit to the people of Limerick and to businesses in the area.

Members supporting the motion highlighted the benefits of adjacent parking, the

capacity of the Council Chamber and the unsuitability of St. Camillus’ Hospital for this

ceremony.

Members against the motion noted that the use of Corporate Headquarters for such

ceremonies would be in conflict with the primary use of the building as a workplace and

suggested that these ceremonies be held outside working hours or in the adjacent

courthouse.

The Deputy Chief Executive stated that the use of various venues for the Civil Ceremony

of Marriage was increasing. He pointed out that the Council had agreed procedures and
---
11

the appropriate insurance for the use of the building by non employees and that the

Council would co-operate with the County Registrars Office, should they wish to

evaluate the location.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District, that the Members***

***agree to the use of the titles of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, in***

***accordance with the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local***

***Government Reform Act 2014, at the 2015 Annual Meeting and for the***

***future, instead of the current titles of Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the Metropolitan***

***District of Limerick.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin stated that he was bringing the motion in

acknowledgement of the history of the city and out of respect for the Office of Mayor. He

noted that the current situation whereby two elected Members held the title of Mayor

was leading to confusion for both incumbents and raising issues amongst the

community, voluntary and business sectors. He stressed that the Members must take

the merger into consideration and that, should they value the Office of Mayor, they had a

duty to elect just one Mayor.

Members against the motion noted that Limerick was an historic city and should retain

its Mayor.

Following a vote, by a show of hands, the motion was defeated.

18.

Correspondence

Correspondence was noted.

At the conclusion of the agenda the Mayor noted that a motion that had been submitted

by Councillor Prendiville, subsequent to the circulation of the agenda, was not an

emergency motion as set down in standing orders and could be taken at the next

Metropolitan Meeting.

Councillor Byrne noted that a previous motion she had submitted in relation to traffic

calming was to have been forwarded to the Strategic Policy Committee and this had not

occurred.

This concluded the Meeting.

Travel and Transportation

30 km/h Speed Limits in Housing Estates

Circulated, report of the A/Director, Travel and Transportation, dated 15th

May, 2015, in relation to proposal for the introduction of 30 km/h speed limits in

Housing Estates.

A short discussion took place on this item during which issues raised by the

Members were responded to by the A/Director of Travel and Transportation. He

explained that the current guidelines provided for 30 km/h limit and that a reduction

to 20 km/h would have no legal standing and would not be enforceable by the

Gardaí.

In response to further queries, the A/Director, Travel and Transportation,

stated that the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport (DTTAS) had recently

published Speed Limit Guidance giving guidance to local authorities in relation to

setting speed limits, including the introduction of 30 km/h speed limits in housing

estates. Limerick City and County Council proposed to introduce this limit as a pilot

project in a limited number of housing estates prior to a more widespread rollout of

30 km/h speed limits in 2016.

He added that the Council proposed that a 30 km/h speed limit would be

introduced in five housing estates in each Municipal District and 15 in the

Metropolitan District (5 per electoral area) in 2015. The Travel and Transportation

Department would meet with Members in each District to agree the estates.

The Members welcomed the pilot project and looked forward to the roll-out of

the reduced speed limit in housing estates in 2016.

NOTICES OF MOTION

It was noted that Item No. 16 – Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M.

Byrne – had been dealt with earlier in the Meeting.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Quinlivan

***I will move at the next Meeting that*** ***Limerick City and County Council call on***

***the Government to: (1) immediately stop domestic water charges which are an***

***unfair and unjust double charge being forced on already struggling***

***households; (2) immediately stop the installation of meters across the country;***

***(3) recognise that Irish Water is not fit for purpose and that it should be***

***abolished; and (4) cease the threat of taking water charges from people’s***

***salary, pension and/or benefits.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Qunilivan, stated that the taking of water

charges directly from people’s wages or social welfare payments would cause

greater hardship for those on the margins. He said that people simply did not have

the means to pay the charge. Councillor Quinlivan added that water metering and

water charges did not encourage conservation. On behalf of his Party, he said what

was needed was investment in the water sector, reduction in the unacceptable high

percentage of leaks and the introduction of water harvesting

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Browne.

Councillor Prendiville said that while he welcomed and supported the Motion,

he was proposing the following amendment and this was seconded by Councillor

Loftus:
---
19

**”I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council**

**wholeheartedly support those actively resisting the introduction of**

**water charges, organising the largest possible non-payment of the bills**

**and halting the installation of water meters and call on the Government**

**to: (1) immediately stop domestic water charges which are an unfair and**

**unjust double charge being forced on already struggling households; (2)**

**immediately stop the installation of meters across the country; (3)**

**recognise that Irish Water is not fit for purpose and that it should be**

**abolished; and (4) cease the threat of taking water charges from**

**people’s salary, pension and/or benefits.”**

A vote in the form of a show of hands was taken on the amendment proposed

by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

The Deputy Mayor declared the amendment defeated as there was not a

majority in favour. Accordingly, he declared the Motion proposed by Councillor

Quinlivan and seconded by Councillor Browne carried.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy (To be

referred to Environment SPC)

***I will move at the next Meeting that an in-depth review of dog control be***

***carried out by Limerick City and County Council, by the Environment Strategic***

***Policy Committee, particularly with respect to our poor comparable statistics***

***to the Counties of Kerry and Cork, with the aim of improving the management***

***and welfare of dogs and for the safety of the public.***

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy

Committee.

Policy Committee.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne (To be

referred to 1916/2016 Commemoration Committee)

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council erect a memorial at the birth***

***place of Con Colbert which reflects the significant role he played in the 1916***

***Rising.***

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the 1916/2016 Commemoration

Committee.

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the relevant Ministers for Agriculture and***

***Arts, Heritage & the Gaeltacht are contacted about the unsatisfactory situation***

***regarding the marketability of lands designated for the hen harrier; in***

***particular, where a farmer wants to*** ***upgrade his/her f**arm by purchasing non-***

***designated agricultural lands from the sale proceeds of the designated land, I***

***am calling on the State to either purchase the relevant land at forestry value or***

***remove the designation so the forestry companies can purchase and plant***

***same.***

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, stated that as a result of farmers’

lands being designated a Special Protected Area (SPA) for the hen harrier, the lands

were almost worthless and that the State should either purchase the relevant land at

forestry value or remove the designation so that forestry companies could purchase

and plant those lands.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J) and agreed.

It was further agreed to circulate the Motion to all local authorities for support.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Ó Ceallaigh

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council provide a facility on the***

***Council website to allow the public view Council*** ***and Municipal Agendas**, as***

***well as how each Councillor voted on each Motion; information will also***

***include each Councillor's political party, if any, as*** ***well as the area which the***

***Councillors represent.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ó Ceallaigh was of the view that the public

should be better informed as to how a Member voted, his/her political affiliation and

the District they represented. He considered that it was important that this

information would be recorded in the minutes of meetings.

**REPLY:**

The website already provides a facility to view Council and Municipal

agendas and the Minutes of the various Meetings held. What is

included in the Minutes is set out in the Standing Orders and Minutes

shall include:

(a) The date, place and time of the Meeting.

(b) The names of the Members present at the meeting.

(c)

The names of the Senior Employees of the Local Authority

present at the Meeting.

(d) Reference to any report submitted to the Members at the Meeting.
---
21

(e) Where there is a roll-call vote, the number and names of

Members voting for and against the motion and of those

abstaining.

(f)

Particulars of all Resolutions passed at the Meeting.

(g) Such other matters considered appropriate.

In the Minutes, Members are listed by name and no party political

affiliation is given.

In relation to items discussed or voted on, the individual Member is

voting as an Elected Representative on the Council, not as a

representative of a political party, or a particular Municipal or

Metropolitan District, and so the question of adding their political party

affiliation does not, and should not, arise.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Browne.

Following some discussion on the issue, the Motion was agreed.

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council make a***

***public statement calling*** ***on the Government to*** ***abolish all remaining legislative***

***barriers to equality for LGBTQ people, including: (i) the ban on blood***

***donations from men who have had sex with men; (ii) the exemptions from***

***equality legislation which allow religious-run schools and hospitals to fire***

***someone on the basis of their sexuality; (iii) the continued legal impediments***

***to gender recognition for trans people as a step to ridding society of***

***homophobia.***

Councillor Prendiville, in proposing the Motion, said that he was calling on the

Government to abolish all remaining legislative barriers to equality for lesbian, gay,

bisexual and transgender people. He added that it was now clear that the vast

majority of people wanted to move away from the discrimination and it was up to the

political establishment to do that. He stated that there were still significant areas of

discrimination, in particular the legislation which exempted schools and hospitals

religiously-run from equality legislation.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Loftus.

A number of Members objected to the Motion.

In the absence of agreement on the Motion, the Deputy Mayor instructed that

a Vote be taken in relation to Councillor Prendiville’s Motion.

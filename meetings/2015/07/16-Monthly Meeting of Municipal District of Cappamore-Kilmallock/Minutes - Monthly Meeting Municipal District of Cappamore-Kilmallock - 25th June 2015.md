QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members
prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been
dealt with:

To Question submitted by Councillor O’Donnell

| will ask at the next meeting if a Register of Derelict Properties is available in
respect of properties in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District to
include properties that are deemed derelict and also properties in respect of
which action has been commenced by the Council.

REPLY: The Derelict Sites Register can be viewed in the Economic
Development & Planning Section of Limerick City and County Council
at 7/8 Patrick Street, Limerick during office hours. This file contains
properties which have been entered in the register.

The Derelict Sites Unit acts on foot of daily derelict site complaints and
endeavours to resolve them in a timely manner by carrying out
inspections on these properties and liaising with property owners. In
the majority of cases these are resolved without needing to enter the
property on the Derelict Sites Register. A list of files where inspections
were carried out recently can be made available on demand.

8. Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

| will ask at the next meeting for an update on the recent fish kill in the
Drumclog River, Knocklong, Co. Limerick.

REPLY: The Council received a report of dead fish in the river at Knocklong on
Monday 8th June. Two members of staff were assigned to investigate
this report and confirmed the fish kill. The Council staff informed Inland
Fisheries Ireland, who also attended on site. The Council and Inland
Fisheries Ireland staff attempted to trace the source upstream, but
were unable to identify the source on the evening in question due to

the lateness of the hour and reduced visibility.

Investigations continued the following day and the day after, in co-
operation with Tipperary County Council. Staff visited approximately 10
farms, five of which were found to have significant problems with silage
effluent containment.

An accidental discharge had occurred in a farm in Limerick through
what is believed to be a crack in the silage slab. This discharge is
believed to be the one which caused the fish kill. As soon as the
discharge was brought to the farmer's attention he co-operated fully in
trying to address the problem.

A total of approximately 4500 fish were killed including trout and
salmon.

Follow up action is being taken by both Local Authorities.

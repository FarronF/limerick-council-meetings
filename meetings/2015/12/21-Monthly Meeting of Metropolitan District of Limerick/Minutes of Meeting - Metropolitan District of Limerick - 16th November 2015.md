setting out proposals for the expenditure of €50,000 allocated under the General Municipal

Allocation 2015 to special projects in Limerick City West.

Members highlighted a number of additional projects across the District worthy of support and

stressed the need to have a more formalised process in allocating similar funding in 2016.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Director of Service, Metropolitan District pointed

out that the wishes of the District with regard to 2015 GMA allocations would be respected and

a capitalisation process was in place in relation to any allocations not drawn down by the end of

2015. He acknowledged the need for a formal policy in relation to the support of outside bodies

and undertook to engage with the Home, Community, Culture and Sport Directorate in relation

to same.

***Flats” at the junction of Mary Street and Creagh Lane.***

**REPLY**:

The subject site is within the ownership of Limerick City and County Council.

A proposal to refurbish the units was sent to the Department of the Environment,

Community & Local Government in October for approval and we are awaiting a

response to same.

**6.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler**

***I will move at the next meeting that all representative bodies that work in the city centre are***---
4

***invited to participate on a committee to develop a night time strategy for Limerick City centre.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler highlighted the social and economic benefits of

representatives of hotels, restaurants, night clubs, vintners, arts, entertainment, sports, etc. in

conjunction with the Council and the Gardai, coming together to develop a cohesive package of

diverse night time activities in the city that would take account of safety and social issues and

attract a wide range of people into the city between the hours of 6pm and 3am.

Members supported the motion and raised the following issues during discussions on same:

 The need to encourage the later opening of shops in the city including Sunday opening and

the need to focus on the time between 6pm and 9pm which can be quiet in the city.

 The potential of supporting the culture of marching bands within the city.

 The need to encourage the opening of more small cafes and a cinema in the city.

 The need to consider the bus service to and from the city, in conjunction with such an

initiative.

 The potential to learn from Galway where all traders meet early each week to discuss plans

and initiatives for that week.

 The need for the Opera site to be progressed and the need to provide a location for bands or

performances in the city with the old tourist office in Arthurs Quay as a possible location.

 The potential of illuminating key features within the city and providing night tours of the city,

including Georgian Limerick.

The Administrative Officer, Economic Development and Planning informed Members that the

Council, in conjunction with Limerick Chamber of Commerce, were formulating an application

for Purple Flag Status for Limerick and a workshop was planned for February, 2016 in this regard.

She also noted that the Economic Development Directorate were considering the establishment

of a City and Town Development Unit with the following remit:

 Retail, commercial and residential occupancy.

 Image and appearance.

 Night time economy.

The Meetings Administrator indicated that this motion would be best dealt with by the

Economic Development Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee from the point of

view of recommending how to move the initiative forward and giving consideration to the

structure of any committee and it was agreed that the matter would be referred to that area.

**7.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council will put a "Yellow Box" at the junction of Lr.***

***North Circular Road and Lr. Shelbourne Road, entering to the mini roundabout. This would***

***free up space and not block the exit, which happens at present during the 'school run', in***

***particular.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Crowley and seconded by Councillor Daly.---
5

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council Traffic Department have examined this proposal

and are consulting with An Garda Síochána Traffic Division and recommending

that this regulatory provision be provided to support school time vehicular traffic

congestion reduction at and adjacent to this location.

**8.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick request the***

***Government to put a 10% tax on chewing gum to be paid to the Council to clean up the mess***

***chewing gum makes on our streets.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan pointed to the high grade street paving in the city

that was being defaced by chewing gum, the recurrence of this issue in spite of previous clean-

ups and the inadequacy of national T.V. campaigns in resolving this problem.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Quinlivan stressed the need for the general public to

challenge offenders and highlighted the need for increased spending to tackle this problem

along with the issuing of fines to offenders.

Members, in general, supported the motion and made the following additional points during

discussions on same:

 The motion was important in terms of the Councils bid for European City of Culture 2020.

 More bins should be provided outside the immediate city centre.

 The education and support of gum users through a poster campaign and the provision of

containers in which to dispose of gum might prove more effective than the raising of a tax

on gum.

 If retailers were concerned with regard to this issue they would not sell gum and they should

be written to in this regard.

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan**

***I will move at the next meeting that, in relation to the two lanes running westward from the***

***Dock Road roundabout, the inside lane be made a "left only lane" and the outer one be made***

***a "straight ahead lane".***

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan noted that, during peak traffic flows, traffic leaving

the city via the Dock Road was encouraged to form two lanes of traffic which then had to merge

into a single lane approaching the first set of traffic lights. He pointed out that this merging

process gave rise to considerable delays and aggressive driving as drivers in the outside lane,

many of whom had overtaken a long line of traffic on the inside lane, sought to force their way

back into the inside lane.

The motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.

There was general agreement amongst the Members that this issue should be reviewed.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council Traffic Department have examined this

proposal.

The

Traffic

Department

advise

that,

in

conjunction

with the Council’s Capital Works Department, designs are being considered for---
6

the reassignment of traffic lane provisions on the Dock Road R510 (between

Bawneys Bridge and the Shannon Bridge roundabout). It is intended that draft

proposals for such works will be brought to the Metropolitan District for

consideration in 2016 following consultation with TII ( Transport Infrastructure

Ireland ) in respect of scheme provisions and funding.

Councillor John Gilligan took the Chair at this point in the meeting as the Mayor had to leave for

another appointment.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District*** ***calls on the Minister for the***

***Environment and the Minister for Finance for the introduction of real rent controls, linking***

***rents to inflation, to stop the sky-rocketing of rents currently taking place.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted the extent to which rents were increasing

in the absence of similar increases in income, the high numbers on the waiting list for social

housing and that landlords were carrying out economic evictions.

In supporting the motion Councillor Quinlivan pointed out the lack of affordable housing and

noted that some couples, each with jobs, could not afford current rents. He referred to his

previous motion calling for an increase in rent supplement and noted that this had been

applied, in some instances, in other cities.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Frankie Daly**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick*** ***City and County Council undertake meaningful***

***consultation with residents and elected members when they are planning to submit proposals***

***for social housing to the various housing agencies. The people have given a mandate to***

***elected representatives to assist them with local issues such as planning and it is not right for***

***the council to make de-facto decisions on where they want to build, with absolutely no input***

***from, or no consultation with, local residents.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Daly and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing the motion Councillor Daly noted the positive benefits that accrue from meaningful

public consultation and stressed that, in the case of proposals to build social housing in

Drominbeg using an Approved Housing Body, such consultation had not taken place and

Members were not afforded a say in this development.

On the proposal of Councillor Quinlivan, seconded by Councillor Daly, it was agreed to suspend

standing orders to allow for the completion of the agenda.

Members, while acknowledging the need for social housing, supported the motion and the

following additional points were raised during discussion on same:

 That issues relating to planning should be included for discussion on the agenda for District

meetings.---
7

 Many support services were required in conjunction with social housing and Members were

not afforded an opportunity to discuss such services in instances such as Drominbeg.

 That there was a considerable difference in the current value of houses in Drominbeg

compared to the larger cost of providing the proposed new units there and the reason for

this difference should be established.

 Drominbeg had no public transport facilities, no amenities beyond a green space and no

community or youth centre. The houses there were in negative equity and there was

already in excess of 10% social housing in the area. Residents did not believe that Members

could have been unaware of proposals to carry out this development.

 All necessary services for an estate should be identified at the planning stage.

 On the proposal of Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor Collins, it was suggested

that two residents from Drominbeg be invited to attend the next District meeting. It was

noted by Members that the District Members, in this instance, did not have the powers to

rule on this proposed development and that consideration be given to meeting residents at

an Operational Briefing instead.

**REPLY**:

It is a priority of Limerick City & County Council to update our elected members of

housing schemes being progressed by this Authority or the Approved Housing

Bodies. The delivery of Social Housing is provided via two distinct supply

channels;

1. Local Authority -Limerick City & County Council or

2. Approved Housing Bodies.

**1.Limerick City & County Council Delivery:**

During 2015 Limerick City & County Council submitted project appraisals to the

Department of Environment Community and Local Government for four projects,

which received ‘Approval in Principle’.

These projects cannot proceed without the approval of the Elected Council

through the Part 8 process/Patrickswell 20 units, Hospital 20 units, Adare 30 units

and Clonmacken 40 units.

A policy document is being finalised presently which outlines the methodology

applied during the site selection process. It is proposed to table this

draft document for discussion at the first Home & Community SPC meeting of

2016.

**2.Approved Housing Bodies Delivery:**

The provision of Housing for people with specific categories of need is funded

under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). Any applications made to the

Department must be supported in terms of identified housing need in that

general area.

During 2015, 110 Units have been approved by the Department of Environment

Community and Local Government for Acquisition and Construction, with a total

estimated budget of €13,036,897.

In the Call for Proposals 15 projects were submitted with 6 receiving funding

approval in principle.

All AHB’s have responsibility for the delivery of the approved projects and have to---
8

go through the normal planning permission process.

Limerick City & County Council will provide updates on the Capital Construction

work programme and developments being progressed by the AHB’s at the

Housing & Community SPC meetings and by regular email to Councillors and

where appropriate to full Council.

The Meetings Administrator informed the Members that the issues they had raised would be

taken into consideration in drawing up policy on site selection. In relation to deputations he

noted that, according to standing orders, proposals to invite any deputation to a District Meeting

should be placed on the agenda in the form of a notice of motion for consideration at the next

meeting.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the Minister for***

***Health to re-open the A&E units in St. John's, Ennis and Nenagh Hospitals and the 1,600***

***hospital beds closed nationally since 2007 and provide the extra staff urgently needed to solve***

***the health crisis.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller highlighted the overcrowding, delays and loss of

dignity experienced by patients in the A&E Department of University Hospital Limerick. He paid

tribute to the staff working in A&E and stressed that people with serious injuries or conditions

had no option but to attend at the A&E.

In seconding the motion Councillor Prendiville noted the number of patients on waiting lists

nationally and indicated that the University Hospital Limerick, despite its best efforts, could not

cope with the number of patients it was expected to deal with and that the centralisation model

had failed.

Members generally supported the motion and stressed the need for the new A&E unit in

University Hospital Limerick to be opened.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Marian Hurley**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council look at options for safety and junction***

***improvements at Walker's Road/Lane, Castletroy, which leads on to the main Dublin Road,***

***R445.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hurley highlighted the volume of traffic at this location and

the concerns of the local residents in relation to the junction in question. She noted that this

matter had already been raised at operational briefings and acknowledged the efforts of staff in

working towards a resolution of this issue.

Councillor Secas also acknowledged the co-operation of staff in bringing forward proposals to

resolve this issue which had already been discussed in detail at the operational briefings and

asked that these proposals be discussed with local residents.---
9

**REPLY**:

Traffic on Walkers Road has increased over the last number of years due to new

housing development in the area, the expansion of Castletroy College and the

construction of Gaelscoil Chaladh an Treoigh.

Footpath and public lighting improvements are warranted on this road as a result

of the increased traffic. However, no budget was provided in 2015 for this work

and a large portion of land necessary for road widening at the R445 end of the

road is not in Council ownership.

The Roads Department will work with the Members and the residents to deliver

some short term improvements on this road over the remainder of the year and

into 2016 such as improving footpaths, public lighting and signage.

It is unlikely that the Council will be able to get agreement to widen the road at

the end of Walkers Road next to the R445 and therefore it may be prudent to

consider making the final section of this road one-way until such time as the field

known as Kenny’s Field is developed. The Roads Department envisage that the

one way section would be very short and will develop plans to show the extent of

this on the rest of the improvements works.

Funding will need to be provided in 2016 for this work either from the GMA fund

or from Planning and Development Levies.

This concluded the Meeting.

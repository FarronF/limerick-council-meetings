**QUESTIONS**

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members prior to the

**4.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Teefy**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what is the situation with regard to taking in charge of Castle***

***Park Estate, Caherconlish.***

**REPLY:**

The Council claimed the bond lodged for the satisfactory completion of this

development and have received payment in respect of same. The Council will

now arrange for the outstanding works to be completed and once these are

completed the formal taking in charge process will be commenced.

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor O'Donnell**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on proceedings taken by Limerick City and County***

***Council regarding the Old Store premises in Herbertstown and if the property can be***

***acquired by way of compulsory purchase.***

**REPLY**:

This Property in currently on the Limerick City & County Council Derelict Sites

Register. The Council obtained a conviction against the registered owners of this

property for non-compliance with an improvement notice issued in accordance

with Section 11 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990. The Council arranged for

remedial works to the property in 2012.

The Council wrote to the registered owners of the property in June 2015

following a complaint that the appearance of the property has deteriorated in

the past couple of years. No reply was received to the letters issued by Limerick

City and County Council so the matter was pursued further by writing to NAMA.

The Council were advised by NAMA that this property was not under their remit.

Following further searches by the Council it has come to our attention that the

Company who own the property has recently re-constituted. Limerick City and

County Council wrote to the company’s solicitor on 6th October 2015 and no

reply has been received to date to this letter. This matter will be followed up in

the coming days.

The Council are not considering the purchase (by compulsory acquisition) of this

property at this time as there is no budget available.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor O'Donnell**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council would consider installing a***

***safety railing on the footpath at Lower Main Street, Bruff between the Church of Ireland and***

***the Bridge in the interest of road safety for pedestrians and in particular children walking to***---
4

***school.***

**REPLY:**

While it is desirable to install a guardrail along this section of footpath, it is not

possible to do so in line with relevant Road Standards.

Guardrails must be situated a minimum of 450mm from kerb edge to prevent

interference with cyclists. However the footpath is narrow here and an installed

guard rail may even encourage pedestrians to walk outside it, increasing the risk

of an incident.

Guardrails can block sight lines of drivers and this could cause a concern for

vehicles that wish to turn down the Athlacca Road.

Guardrails have contributed in an increase in driver speed in areas where they

are installed.

The Road Safety Authority have issued guidance to parents bringing their

children to school to ‘keep hold of your child’s hand at all time’. This advice is the

best measure for keeping children safe along the route.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**7.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sheehy**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council immediately erect a barrier on the Tully***

***Road, Glenroe where there is a number of bad bends and a 40 foot deep ravine.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy and seconded by Councillor Ryan.

**REPLY**:

Having investigated this matter, Limerick City and County Council find that the

risk to road users at this location will be greatly reduced by the erection of a

series of warning signs leading up to and along these bends. This solution then

negates the need for any barrier.

Councillor Sheehy stated that she was not satisfied with the response provided as she

felt a barrier was justified at this location. She added that it was a serious issue as this stretch

of road was extremely dangerous. Following a short discussion, it was agreed to provide more

specific detail for the issue to be looked at again by the Council.

**8.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy**

***I will move at the next Meeting that improvement works be carried out to the footpath on***

***the Limerick side of Bruff (R512), this footpath forms part of the new Slí na Sláinte route in***

***Bruff.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Teefy and seconded by Councillor Mitchell.

**REPLY**:

Repair work will be carried out along limited sections of footpath before years

end.

However significant funding is required to repair/replace worn sections of

footpath, which is not available from the General Maintenance Budget but may

become available from other funding sources.---

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O’Donnell**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council install appropriate and***

***necessary traffic calming measures at the National School in Knockainey in the interest of***

***road safety.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donnell and seconded by Councillor Ryan.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council will review the area in question and install all

appropriate signing and lining to help with traffic calming.

The following items were raised at the completion of the Agenda:

On the proposal of Councillor Teefy, seconded by Councillor Gleeson, it was agreed by the

Members to hold a Municipal Reception for representatives of the Kilteely-Dromkeen

Community following their success as the overall winner for population centres of up to 300 in

the Pride of Place Competition.

Members also expressed their congratulations to the representatives from Scanlon Park,

Castleconnell who were runners up in the competition and to the Bruff community who also

represented Limerick.

A short discussion took place on the holding of a number of other Municipal Receptions in the

New Year. The Cathaoirleach stated that these would be considered further at the next

Meeting.

The Meetings Administrator stated that each Municipal District was required to nominate one

Member to attend a Meeting with the National Roads Authority, now Transport Infrastructure

Ireland. It was agreed that the Cathaoirleach would attend and if he was unavailable he would

nominate another Member to attend on his behalf.

The Meetings Administrator referred to decision made at a previous Meeting to host a

Municipal Reception for members of the Hospital Handball Club. As Members were required to

attend a Municipal Reception at 6pm, it was agreed to adjourn the Meeting to Monday, 23rd

Development Zone Pilot Initiative had been successful. It was acknowledged that the application
had been made by Innovate Limerick. A grant had been approved in the amount of €42,000. A
further sum of €14,000 would have to be matched from Council funds. It was noted that the

total project cost was €56,000.

> Restoration of the heritage style lamp posts.
> Upgrading (painting) of the footbridge.

Members welcomed the funding and hoped that value for money would be secured. Concern
was expressed that the funding, though welcome, would not cover all that was required to be
done. It was also stated that as it was very late in the year and as funds had to be spent by year
end there was very little time to successfully complete projects.

The Director of Services also advised the Members that a presentation would be made by staff
from Economic Development and Planning at the December Meeting. It was also his intention
to keep Strategic Development for the District on the Agenda.

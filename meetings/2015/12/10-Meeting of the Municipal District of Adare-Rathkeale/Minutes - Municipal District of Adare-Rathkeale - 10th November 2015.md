2. Regional Directorate (Mid West National Road Design Office)
Proposed N21 Adare Western Approach Improvement Scheme

Mr. Dermot Donovan, Roadplan Consulting, presented and circulated a briefing document
detailing the location of the proposed works, the primary issues that had arisen from the Public
Information Process and the consideration of same and maps showing details of the proposed
works and Scheme milestones.

Members thanked Mr. Donovan for his presentation and the following points were made by
various Members in relation to same:

That Members should be given a costing of the various sections of the project.

Significant delays were already experienced by road users passing through Adare at peak
times and thousands of vehicles were using local roads to bypass Adare. These local roads
were not constructed to carry this volume of extra traffic safely and the proposed works in
Adare should not proceed until viable bypass routes had been identified and made safe for
the volume of traffic that would have to avail of same.

e &fforts should be made to divert traffic as far back from Adare as possible during the
works.

e The proposed works in Adare should only be planned in conjunction with the new Foynes
Road or taking the agreed route for same into consideration.

e The presentation lacked sufficient detail and should take the availability of parking spaces,
the limiting of pedestrian crossings to improve traffic throughput and the handling of
school traffic into consideration.

¢ The works proposed for Adare were positive and needed but viable bypass routes would
have to be provided during construction.

In response to issues raised by Members, Mr. Donovan clarified the following:

e There would be insufficient warrant for a footbridge at the school in place of the proposed
pedestrians crossing.

e It was planned that works would not be carried out in the summer months during the peak
tourist season and traders had requested that works be postponed until after the
Christmas period.

e The capacity and condition of any proposed diversionary routes would be taken into
consideration.

© No date had yet been set for the commencement of the Part Vill process as the project
team wanted to meet as many interested parties as possible in advance of same.

e The footprint of a roundabout at the junction currently controlled by traffic lights had been
examined and it was found that it would require land acquisition that would impact on the
wall of the adjacent estate lodge and National Heritage Area.

e The proposals for a permanent car park with 33 spaces adjacent to the school would work
well, the school was in favour of same and there would be no necessity to create
temporary car parking adjacent to the town park.

The Senior Engineer informed the Members that the proposed works would cost in excess of €1
million. An allocation of €0.5 million had already been made by Til (Transport Infrastructure
Ireland) and it was proposed to meet with Til to have the allocation increased to the projected
cost of building the project. He undertook to consult with the District Members again in advance
of the Part VIII process.

3. An Garda Siochana

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Thomas O’Connor and Sergeant Frank O'Sullivan
from Newcastle West District Garda Station to the Meeting.

Superintendent O'Connor outlined to Members the District’s crime figures for this year compared
to last year. Members thanked Superintendent O’Connor for his update and the following points
were raised by various Members during discussion.

e That the elderly were living in fear and that crime may be under reported due to the
closure of Garda Stations.

¢ The benefits of the ‘Community Text Alert’ scheme to rural areas were noted and it was
suggested that ‘Community Text Alert’ groups should be linked to neighbouring towns and
townlands.

e Croom Garda Station located in the centre of the District, should be opened on a full time
basis to facilitate a quicker response time to crimes in the District.

e The recent increase of crime in Askeaton was a matter of concern and a police presence in
the town could help curtail criminality.

¢ The criminal justice system needed to be reviewed, in particular in relation to free legal aid,
suspended sentences and duration of sentences.

¢ That there was benefit in a member of An Garda Siochdna attending at District Meetings as
this facilitated the discussion of issues specific to the District.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Superintendent pointed out that the Newcastle
West District covered a geographic area bigger than the size of County Monaghan. He encouraged
citizens to report crime and indicated that there was a criminal element from Limerick City linked
to rural crimes. He indicated that preventing the youth getting involved in crime was paramount
and that the Gardai were working with youth projects and transition year students in this regard.
He indicated that the Gardai were visiting elderly people in their homes and called upon local
people to visit the elderly in their area.

4. Coillte

Mr. Bernard Burke, Coillte, presented an overview of Coillte activities and pointed out that
Curraghchase was formerly owned by the De Vere Family. He indicated that Curragh Chase House
was destroyed by fire in 1941 and the lands and house were later acquired by the State. He added
that the primary management objective for the entire forest at Curragh Chase was nature
conservation, biodiversity and recreation and that Coillte were committed to managing the
resource through a silvicultural method of Close to Nature Forestry

In response to Members queries on the possibility of restoring Curragh Chase House and opening
it as a restaurant that would rival Muckross House in Killarney, Mr. Burke pointed out that Curragh
Chase was an internationally important Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for the rare Lesser
Horse Shoe Bat and the house was home to a population of Lesser Horseshoe Bats who use it as a
winter and summer roost. He noted that an engineering survey of the house was being carried
out and that Coillte would work in partnership with parties interested in restoring Curragh Chase

House.

Mr. Burke pointed out that the erection of an electronic barrier at Curraghchase had helped
alleviate anti-social behaviour. Following Members queries on whether Curragh Chase was part of
the Wild Atlantic Way he indicated that Curragh Chase was not on the Wild Atlantic route,
however, talks with Failte Ireland were taking place regarding investment for Curragh Chase.

Following Members queries on the proposed routes for the N69 Foynes to Limerick Road
improvement Scheme, Mr. Burke confirmed that none of the proposed routes would take in any
lands at Curraghchase. Members queried if the adjacent proposed route could bring additional
connectivity to Curraghchase and he indicated that if this route was selected further submissions

could be made.

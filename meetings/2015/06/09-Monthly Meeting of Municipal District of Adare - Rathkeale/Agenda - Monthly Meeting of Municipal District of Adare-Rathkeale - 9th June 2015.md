of hedgerows on all routes in the county. Specifically the road from O'Rourke's Cross to
Newcastle West, a main route for heavy vehicles and school buses, is not fit for purpose.
Two heavy vehicles cannot pass on this road safely. The main routes that school buses
use to collect our children, for primary and secondary schools, must be assessed as a

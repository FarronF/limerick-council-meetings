QUESTIONS

4. Question submitted by Councillor C. McMahon

| will ask at the next Meeting what the current situation is regarding vermin control
in Gortadroma as complaints are being made in relation to same.

REPLY:

The Council engaged the services of Rentokil to place bait boxes within the
landfill during the period within which Gortadroma Landfill was accepting
Household waste. The Council also provided a bait service to Local residents
who requested it.

The Council ceased accepting waste for disposal in April 2014. The last
remaining waste cell was fully capped and sealed by the summer of 2014.
The Rentokil Contract for the local residents was terminated in September
2014 as there was no longer any available food source to attract vermin.
The Residents were informed of the termination of this contact in July 2014

The Council retains the service of Rentokil in the area of the waste transfer
station even though all organic wastes are contained in sealed compactor
skips. Rentokil issue a report confirming if there has been any activity since
their previous inspection when they maintain these baits boxes. These
reports confirm if any bait has been consumed or if there has been any
activity detected at the source. The reports to date have confirmed that there
has not been any activity at the current bait boxes at the Landfill.

The Council does not consider the landfill to be a source of vermin and is
satisfied that the issue of vermin outside of the landfill is not a result of the

Councils activity.

Members indicated that residents living near the former Gortadroma Landfill site are
concerned at the high number of rats that are being caught in the area and indicated that
this was a serious public health issue.

The Senior Executive Engineer indicated that he would bring this issue to the attention of
the Health Board and report back to Members on the outcome.

5. Question submitted by Councillor Ciara McMahon

1 will ask at the next Meeting for an update on guidance or help given to
Shanagolden National School subsequent to their deputation.

REPLY: The Senior Executive Engineer and Area Technician met with members of
the Shanagolden NS Parents Council Safety Committee in February. The
members highlighted their concerns in relation to traffic movements on the
road (L1620) outside the school, particularly in the morning and evening
when children are being dropped off and picked up.

The members were seeking advice on how to best improve the safety of the
children when entering or leaving the school. The following items were

discussed:

1.

As parking is limited in front of the school the committee members were
advised to consider setting back the entrance of the school to allow the
school bus park and collect the children without them having to step out
onto the road. The committee members were advised to get a design
drawing prepared which they could then get costed.

The setting back of the wall across the road from the school was also
reviewed. There is planning permission for a house directly across the
road from the school. The setting back of the wall is not part of the
planning permission.

The development of a car park on a site adjacent to the school on the
North Western side and one across the road adjacent to the proposed
dwelling house were also discussed. Both sites involved the purchase of
land and negotiations with landowners. The site across the road would
require a pedestrian crossing. These options would require the
development of a design.

The provision of additional signage and road markings were also
discussed. The SEE gave a commitment that road markings would be put
in place subject to funding being available. These road markings would
be put in place when contractors are carrying out work across other sites
in the area. The provision of additional signage was also agreed.

The construction of a footpath from the school to meet the existing
footpath to the village was also discussed. The road to the school is
narrow and land take would be required for the footpath.

6. Question submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue:

! will ask at the next Meeting for the staffing levels requested by each electoral Area
Office in relation to Roads and the actual staffing granted to each Area Office as |
believe that our Roads Departments are critically understaffed.

REPLY: The recruitment of staff is subject to sanction by the Department of the
Environment. A staffing request is currently with the Department for a
number of posts including General Operatives.

Limerick City and County Council has recently employed a number of
temporary General Operatives. Interviews for additional temporary General
Operatives are scheduled to take place on week ending 15” May, 2015.

Members pointed out that staffing levels were down and highlighted the need to get road
works completed during the good weather. Members pointed out that local knowledge
would be lost due to the retirement of a number of foremen and requested that modem

technology and mapping be used to capture this knowledge.

The Operations Manager, South and West Division indicated that there had been a staffing
embargo for the past 6 years and that 20% of staff had been lost and not replaced. In
relation to knowledge transfer he noted that the Change Management Team were putting
systems in place to capture data.

7 Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

! will ask at the next Meeting for a report on the recent visit by Members, staff and
community representatives to a gasification plant in France.

REPLY: The site visit report was emailed to the Adare-Rathkeale Members on the
13" March 2015, the day after the visit to France. The question regarding
the plant being operational was also addressed within the report.

| attach herewith the site visit report for the information of the Members.

CHO Power Marc Lefour, Director of CHO Power who operate the Plant in
Marcenx

Background and Purpose of the Visit

Gortadroma landfill has been operating under an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
waste licence since 1999. The Landfill ceased accepting waste for disposal in May 2014
and all the waste cells are now fully capped. Aftercare operations to manage the waste as
it decays including landfill gas and leachate generated will still be required throughout the
aftercare phase. This period typically lasts for 30 years after which the waste licence can
be surrendered back to the EPA.

The Landfill represents a major infrastructure asset for LCCC and as part of a process to
maximise the use of this resource, bidders were invited to express an interest and submit
options to LCCC on potential future uses. A preferred bidder was selected as part of this
process, their proposal is to use approximately 14Ha of the landfill to site a Gasification
Plant for the processing of municipal waste and the generation of electricity. This Proposal
was presented to the Adare — Rathkeale Area meeting in Sept, 2014. A further
Presentation by the Bidder was given to the Area meeting in December 2014. The Area
Councillors requested that in order to be able to better understand the implications of such
a proposal they and local residents representatives should visit an operational plant. The
visit was therefore arranged for that purpose.

Details of the Plant at Morceux.

The plant commenced operation in March 2014. It was initially of a Romanian design and
according to LR assumed unrealistic Btu values in the incoming waste. As a result the
original design has a number of flaws which PRM are assisting in the re-design and
improvement of. The Plant treats approx. 50,000 tonnes per annum of Municipal Solid
Waste but with no organic content. The MSW is combined with Wood Chippings as per
their French Waste Licence requirements. It generates approx 7MW of power, 2MW from
Gas Engines and 5 MW from a steam Turbine.

The Process consists of 3 stages:
1) Waste Reception/Pre-treatment involving shredding and grading
2) Gasification — single module. (note, there is no secondary gasification stage for the
ash as would be the case for the Cadence Environpower)
3) Energy Generation (from the syngas used in the gas engines and steam to power a

steam turbine)

The Waste reception and pre-treatment storage while under cover is not contained in a
negative pressure building and there are no odour control systems in place.
The pre-treatment phase gives rise to dust and CHO were in the early process of

constructing dust extraction equipment.
The Visit was divided into three information gathering sessions

1) Wednesday Evening — Open Discussions with Leonardo Reira, Environpower on
the proposal

2) Thursday Morning — Site visit of the Gasification Plant in Morcenx, Tour given by
Marc Lefour of CHO accompanied by Leonardo Riera and Ron Bailey.

3) Thursday — Afternoon — Post visit discussion with Leonardo Riera and Ron Bailey
on any issue or clarifications arising.

Keys points noted during the visit
The nature and quantity of any ash arising from the process. LR stated that the ash would

be classified as inert and could possibly be used in low stress construction activity. There
seemed to be a difference in opinion between LR and RB on the % of ash arising with LR
stating 3% to 5% and RB stating 5% to 10% of the volume of Waste being turned into ash
from the process. Concerns were raised regarding the storage and/or use of this material
including any temporary storage of the proposal. The nature and management of the Ash
at the Morceux plant was not very satisfactory with open storage and evidence of wind
blown contamination. LR assured the group that this would not be the case in the
proposed plant.

Traffic volumes and management, the proposed waste tonnages of 1000 tonnes per day, 7
days per week. The Residents raised the issues of traffic volumes, types and size
vehicles, operating times, suitability of the road infrastructure and queuing and or parking
of vehicles outside of the facility.

General Operating Hours would be a major concern for Local Residents, LR stated that
the proposed plant receive waste 6 days per week but was non-specific regarding the
exact hours of waste acceptance. The Plant itself being required to run 24 hours, 7 days
per week.

Noise and Vibration. The residents noted the operating noise during the visit. The plant
was not fully operational at the time of the visit, a key blower unit having failure at 4am that
morning. The plant was “hot” and some machinery was still in operation giving a consistent
background noise level. LR was queried over the potential noise levels at the plant. He did
not provide any specific figures but stated that the proposed plant would be quieter.

Water used and any discharge of waste water. LR clarified that the plant would not be
discharging waste water. All water in the process would be recycled back through the
plant. Uncontaminated Surface water runoff would discharge to normal surface waters as
the current situation at the Landfill.

Dust management during retreatment. The Plant at Morceaux does have some issues with
Dust management in the shredding area and are currently upgrading/installing dust
extraction systems.

Odour control. While is was noted that there were no obvious odour issues at the Plant,
the incoming waste was mainly commercial with little or no organic content. During the
Post visit meeting RB stated that negative pressure buildings with Bio-filter treatment are
effective at Odour control. He cited a PRM gasification facility in Scotland which treats
tannery waste as an example of effective odour control.

Proximity of residents to the plant, ML stated that there were local residents within 250m of
the Morcenx Plant.

Members expressed their disappointment at the negative media coverage their trip to the
gasification plant in France had received as the coverage had focused on the cost of the
trip and that the plant was not fully operational during the visit. They pointed out that,
while a conveyor belt had been out of order at the time of the visit, the main body of the
plant was operational. A discussion took place on the merits of organising a visit of a
smaller group to a plant in America or a return visit to the plant in France and in this regard
Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Keary proposed that a group comprising a
council employee, a Councillor and a member of the local committee should revisit the

plant in France.

Members stressed the importance of maintaining communications with the public on this
issue and discussed the need for a public meeting.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Environment stressed that the gasification plant in France
operated under EU standards and noted the significance of visiting a plant that dealt with a
waste stream, similar to that proposed for Gortadroma. In relation to public consultation
he indicated that this should commence after the lease had been signed.

NOTICE OF MOTION

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Ciara McMahon

! will move at the next Meeting that the councillors and council staff work together
as soon as possible to have a public meeting regarding the proposed development
of a gasification plant at Gortadroma. This would be the first in a series of meetings
and public consultation.

Cllr. McMahon highlighted the concerns of the public and proposed that public
consultations commence to address these concerns. The Motion was seconded by
Councillor O'Brien who added that concerns of the public needed to be addressed.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Environment, indicated that public meetings could
commence once the lease had been signed and stamp duty paid. He undertook to write to
the public once the lease had been signed.

The following items were raised by Members at the completion of the Agenda.

Councillor Sheahan, while welcoming the announcement of a new sewerage scheme for
Athea, expressed disappointment that no sewerage plant has been planned for Askeaton.
He indicated that this was a health threat and that no new houses should be built in
Askeaton until a sewerage plant was built. He requested that Irish Water be written to
outlining the need for a new sewerage plant for Askeaton.

Councillor O’Brien indicated that the announcement of the shelving of the motorway
between Cork and Limerick, the two major cities on the western side of the country, was a
backward step and would have implications for the economic development of the region
and for Shannon Airport.

Councillor O'Donoghue requested that the NRA be written to setting out the serious traffic
issues at Banogue on the N20. In particular he indicated that the sudden drop in the
speed limit from 100 kph to 50 kph was giving rise to accidents. He noted that it was
taking vehicular traffic up to 15 minutes to cross the N20 at Banogue.

Councillor Keary raised the issue of a delegation from Killeheen Residents attending at the
next Meeting to discuss the installation of a traffic island at Reens to assist cars turning
right onto the old N21.

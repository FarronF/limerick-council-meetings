1. Home and Social Development

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Director and Senior Executive Officer from Home
and Social Development and said the Meeting had been convened to discuss
housing related issues.

In response to queries from the Members in relation to Cois na Féile, Abbeyfeale, the
Director outlined the background to the development. She stated that the site was
initially owned by Limerick County Council and was disposed of in 2006. It was noted
that planning permission was granted in 2006 for 12 semi-detached and 12
townhouses. The Special Contribution of €220,000 which was initially proposed by
Limerick County Council for provision of footpath, public lighting and surface water,
was reduced to €110,000 by An Bord Pleanala. In 2007, Cluid Housing Association
applied for funding under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme for the purchase of
a development of 12 (3) bed units of accommodation at Cois na Féile. In February
2008, a loan of €2.37m was sanctioned by the Department of the Environment,
Community and Local Government for this project. Under the Capital Loan and
Subsidy Scheme, finance was provided by the Housing Finance Agency. At a
Meeting held on the 31st March, 2008, the Council gave its approval to the raising of
a loan of 2.37m from the Housing Finance Agency.

The Director further stated that Cluid entered into a Building Agreement with
Kilmoney Construction. In March 2009, Kilmoney assigned their interest in the
Building Agreement to Shineford Limited. The Building Agreement between
Shineford and Cluid Housing terminated in May 2012 due to contractual issues.
Payments to Cluid at this point were €1.44m. In January 2014, Cluid secured a
licence from the landowner to allow them enter the site and complete the works to
the estate and to finish off outstanding works to houses numbers 13-24 only. In order
to complete the infrastructure, it was necessary to negotiate with adjacent
landowners to secure wayleaves. This was now in progress. Tendering of the works
was now complete and the contractor would commence on site upon receipt of letter
of acceptance/contract.

It was noted that revised budget approval had been received from the Department of
the Environment, Community and Local Government. The project budget was now
estimated at €2.631m (an increase of €256,000 on the original budget). Unit cost
per house was now approximately €219,000. Under the Capital Loan and Subsidy
Scheme, full recoupment from the Department was not possible until houses were
occupied.

The Director stated that approval to increase the original loan amount to €3.114m to
include loan charges already paid by the Council, in the sum of €482,205, would be
sought at Meeting of Full Council in May 2015.

The proposed start date of 1 June, 2015, would mean a finish date at end of
February, 2016. She advised that houses should be allocated by March 2016. The
Director confirmed that the Council had 100% nomination rights to the 12 units.

Footpath and public lighting: It was estimated that the cost would be approximately
€202,500. Since there was insufficient funding for the footpath and public lighting, it
was proposed to seek the required funding from the Development Contribution Fund.

Matters Raised by Members:

The following matters were raised by Members:

Attendance of relevant staff at Municipal District Meetings.

Housing Construction/Maintenance Programmes.

Housing Adaptation Grants for Social Housing - level of funding available.
Tenant Purchase Scheme.

Unfinished Estates.

Processing time for Housing Applications.

It was agreed that Engineering staff would attend Meetings of the Municipal District if
items were included on the Agenda relating to their work area. The Operations
Manager confirmed that staff would be available on the day, if required.

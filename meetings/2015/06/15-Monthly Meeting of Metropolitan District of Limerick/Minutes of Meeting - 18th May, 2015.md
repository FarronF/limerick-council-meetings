Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***I will move at the next Metropolitan meeting that the council undertake a review of***

***the properties on the approach to Limerick City Centre via the Dock Road with***
---
***regard to improving the unsightly appearance of this roadway.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor McCreesh highlighted the condition of some of the

properties on the city side of the Greenpark roundabout and also the potential to

improve the appearance of the recycling bins located in that area.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Leddin stressed the need to actively engage with

businesses with regard to the appearance of their premises and noted that some

businesses in the area under discussion had invested heavily to improve the

appearance of their premises and would be disappointed with the condition of some of

the neighbouring premises.

Members supported the motion and made the following points on foot of same.

 That city of culture signage be removed or used for an alternative advertisement

such as the Council’s bid for European Capital of Culture 2020.

 While acknowledging the work carried out by the Shannon Foynes Port Company in

improving the appearance of Limerick Docks, the presence of large deposits of scrap

metal at the docks remained unsightly and Shannon Foynes Port Company should

be contacted in this regard.

**REPLY**:

A review will be undertaken of the Dock Road area in the coming weeks.

Any properties that are deemed to be unsightly / derelict will be inspected.

The Council will endeavour to have remedial works undertaken by the

owners of these properties and where appropriate, notices can be served

on the owners under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990.

The Deputy Chief Executive welcomed the motion and undertook to review the issue

raised in conjunction with the Operations Manager for the Division.

Members raised the issue of businesses sponsoring individual roundabouts and a

motion was put by Councillor Butler, seconded by Councillor Byrne, that the Council

would draw up a scheme to invite annual expressions of interest for the sponsorship of

roundabouts and present same to a future meeting.

The Deputy Chief Executive indicated that he would ask the Economic Development and

Planning Directorate to review this proposal and revert as soon as possible.

8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next*** ***meeting that we write to the Ministers for Environment and***

***Justice explaining how attempts by our predecessor, the Limerick City Council, to***

***bring water charge boycotters to court failed to break non-payment, and calling***

***on them to scrap draconian plans to bring water bill non-payers to court in order***

***to get attachment orders. In that letter we should encourage them to follow the***

***example of the old Limerick City Council and abandon the water charges, and***

***instead fund the service through progressive taxation.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

Members supporting the motion spoke of the stress that water charges place on the

most vulnerable and how water charges will result in students having to pay increased
---
deposits for accommodation. Members also pointed out that the sums to be collected

now will be inadequate to fund Irish Water and had the set up costs for Irish Water been

invested directly in improving the network, water charges would be lower. It was also

noted that Irish Water will now make decisions in relation to the expansion of water

services needed to support development.

Members against the motion noted the extent of investment needed to upgrade the

water network infrastructure and deal with water quality issues. They pointed out that

water charges were the most appropriate funding mechanism and would also encourage

conservation of water.

The motion was passed, following a show of hands.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

***I will move at the next*** ***meeting that the Council and Regeneration exert every***

***effort to ensure the supermarket at Watchhouse Cross does not remain***

***vacant and that this important service for the community is restored. We should***

***request a progress report for the June meeting.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville highlighted the importance of the

supermarket at Watchhouse Cross to the community and the danger that the site will

visually detract from the local amenity, if left vacant.

In seconding the motion Councillor Quinlivan raised his concerns for neighbouring

businesses should the premises remain vacant and noted that the post office on the site

was due to reopen on 2nd June, 2015.

Members supported the motion and the following points were made in relation to same:

 That, given the risk of supermarkets closing at short notice, the co-location of post

offices with supermarkets was an issue and the Council should look into providing

locations for post offices.

 That the Council introduce a scheme to provide rates relief to businesses in danger

of closure and bring forward proposals in this regard.

 That the increased cost of insurance for businesses should be highlighted to the

Government.

**REPLY:**

The site owner has not approached the Council for assistance. At every

opportunity, the Council has, and will continue to advise potential investors

that a business opportunity exists in Moyross, a designated District Retail

Centre.

The Deputy Chief Executive noted that, while the Economic Development and Planning

Directorate would engage with key players in relation to the site, it had to be

acknowledged that this site was in private ownership.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller

**I will move at the next** **meeting that we write to Bus Eireann calling on them to**

**relocate the following bus stops:**
---
**1)**

**Ballysimon Road - beside the Woodlawn Park entrance inward bound**

**2)**

**Dublin Road - St Patrick's Road - Cherryville Junction next to Maxol**

**Station outward bound**

**on the grounds of safety for pedestrians, restrictions to traffic flow, and general**

**road safety for all users.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor O’Dea.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller pointed out that the bus stop referred to on the

Ballysimon Road was located 20 yards from a pedestrian crossing with the result that

the bus often stops on the pedestrian crossing and also obstructs the view of traffic

exiting from Woodlawn Park. In relation to the bus stop on the Dublin Road, Councillor

Keller noted that the bus blocks the single lane exiting the city at this location and also

blocks the view of traffic exiting the adjacent Maxol Garage.

Members supported the motion and indicated that the Travel and Transportation

Department had already carried out work in this area.

It was also emphasised by Members that consideration be given to relocating, not

removing, the bus stops in question.

The Acting Director of Service, Travel and Transportation informed the Members that the

location of bus stops was now a function of the Council and that he would examine the

two locations and revert to Members in relation to same.

At the conclusion of the agenda Councillor Hourigan requested that an update on the

Natura Wetlands Report 1999 be provided at the next meeting.

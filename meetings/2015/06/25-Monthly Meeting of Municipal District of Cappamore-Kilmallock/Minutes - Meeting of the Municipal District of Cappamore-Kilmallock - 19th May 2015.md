The City and County Council sought approval from the DECLG for the
purchase of individual houses with a view to having flexibility in
particular for special needs cases. However, we have not received
santion for this course of action at this point in time. Under its social
housing options the Council can consider taking a lease on a house for
RAS tenants or indeed if an applicant is approved for HAP, they can
seek to rent a suitable rural house.

NOTICES OF MOTION

6. otice of Motion submitted by Counci Sheeh

| will move at the next Council Meeting that the issue of speeding with
reference to safety for walkers and cyclists on the Grange Road, Knocklong,
be addressed with adequate signage, lining and Garda or speed van
monitoring or other methods.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy and seconded by Councillor
Mitchell.

REPLY: The issue of alleged speeding on this section of the R513, where the
general speed limit applies, is an enforcement matter for the Gardai.
The straight stretch of the R513 in Grange, Knocklong is one of the few
safe passing locations between Herbertstown and Ballylanders.
Limerick City & County Council has a duty to maintain passing out
areas like Grange, as otherwise, frustrated drivers may attempt to
overtake slow moving vehicles at dangerous locations and cause a
serious incident. Limerick City & County Council are satisfied that
current signage and lining are adequate.

The following items were raised at the completion of the Agenda:

The Members expressed their concern regarding the vacancy following the transfer
of Superintendent Patwell from Bruff Garda Division and requested an update from
the Chief Superintendent's Office. It was agreed to invite a representative from the
Bruff District Garda Station to the June Monthly Meeting.

The Director of Service updated the Members regarding the Old School House
Grange. He informed them that the Council were ready to approve the appointment
of Contractors to carry out work at the Old School House, as soon as the licence
agreement for all groups, using the premises, was signed and returned with current
insurance details to the Council .

The Members wished the communities of Kilteely and Bruff well in the 2015 IPB
Pride of Place Competition.

entitled *‘Local Property Tax – Local Adjustment Factor 2015 – Report on Public*

*Submissions Received; and (ii)* report from Head of Finance dated 21st September,

2015, *entitled ‘Local property Tax – Local Adjustment Factor 2016.’*

The Head of Finance introduced this item by informing Members that a local

authority could, as a Reserved Function, resolve to vary the basic rate of the Local

Property Tax (LPT) within its functional area by a maximum of +/-15%. He added

that any decision to vary the basic rate of LPT must be taken by 30th September

each year in order to take effect from 1st November (the liability date) and therefore

determine the LPT liability of taxpayers for the following year.

The Head of Finance stated, in his report dated 21st September 2015, that in

accordance with Section 7 of the Local Property Tax Local Adjustment Factor

Regulations, 2014, an advertisement seeking submissions from the Public had been

placed in the local newspaper and also on the Council website. Submissions had

been invited via completion of an online survey, by email or by post. The closing date

for receipt of submissions was 19th August, 2015. A total of 14 valid submissions

had been received with outcome as follows:

No. of valid submissions received:

14

No. of submissions requesting a reduction: 10

No. of submissions requesting an increase: 1

No. of submissions requesting no change: 3

Councillor Collins (M) proposed no change in the Local Property Tax basic

rate for 2016. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh proposed to vary the Local Property Tax basic rate

downwards by 15% for 2016. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Browne.

The Chief Executive addressed the Meeting stating that the value of a

potential increase or decrease in 2016 Local Property Tax allocation, if maximum

variation of 15% were implemented by Limerick City and County Council, would be---
5

€2,302,060. The report of the Head of Finance had stated that based on preliminary

projections for Budget 2016, the Council had additional unfunded demands of €5.0

million and a reduction in income from Local Property Tax would increase that

funding gap. In light of that, there was no scope to reduce the base rate of LPT for

2016.

The Mayor directed that a Vote be taken on the proposal put forward by

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Browne to vary the Local Property

Tax basic rate downwards by 15% for 2016. The result of the voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillors Browne, Keller, Loftus, McCreesh, McMahon, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh,

Prendiville, Quinlivan, Sheehy. **(9)**

O’Dea, O’Donnell, O’Donoghue, O’Hanlon, Ryan, Scanlan, Secas, Sheahan (J),

Sheahan (M), Teefy. **(28)**

There were no abstentions.

The Mayor declared the Motion defeated and accordingly the following

resolution was adopted:

Proposed by Councillor Collins (M);

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J);

And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act,

2012, as amended by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act, 2013,

Limerick City and County Council hereby determines that the basic rate of Local

Property Tax (LPT) should not be varied for the period of one year from the next

Local Property Tax liability date in respect of relevant residential properties situated

following:---

• Actual request was for €27.5 million which was a reduction on the previous

year.

the 5 day detention period be reduced to 3 days.”

Councillor Prendiville suggested that efforts should be made first to re-home

horses, including through the horse rescue groups, and only if that failed should

other options be considered.

The Director of Environment and Water recommended that the draft bye-laws,

as circulated, be made and that the additional amendments, as raised by the

Members, would be brought back to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee for

consideration in relation to the preparation of amended bye-laws to take account of

18th September, 2015, together with draft Food Strategy for Limerick 2016-2018.

The Mayor welcomed Mr. James Burke, James Burke & Associates, to the

Meeting.

Mr. Burke stated that, in relation to a Food Strategy for Limerick, the vision

was to enhance Limerick’s reputation for great food and to build on existing support

structures which were designed to help maximise the economic prosperity for its

food stakeholders. He gave a PowerPoint presentation to the Members, highlighting

the following in relation to the preparation of the Food Strategy:

• The process involved.

• Strengths and weaknesses.

• Opportunities and strengths.

• Short term Actions/Long Term Considerations.

Mr. Burke continued by stating that the new Food Strategy which was being

developed by the Council anticipated creating 86 new jobs in the local food industry

over a three year period. He explained that the report presented to the Members

focused on the development of “food tourism” in Limerick. It also highlighted the

potential for creating a food brand and logo for Limerick products.

He further explained that the strategy was broken into 2 sections:

• Short term actions.

• Long term considerations.

The key short term actions included the following:

• To develop a united food community.

• To improve business skill sets.

The considerations recommended for the longer term were:

• Tell the Limerick Food Story.

• Develop a food zone.

• Put enablers in place to support the strategy roll-out.---
10

In summing up, he said that it was hoped the Strategy, when in place, would

result in increased food exports. The establishment of more new food businesses

and stronger credentials for Limerick as a food processing retail and tourism

destination, as well as increased employment opportunities, would result.

In response to a query raised, the Director of Economic Development and

Planning confirmed that the Council was supportive of the project.

The Members were unanimous in their support for the Food Strategy and

welcomed the proposals contained therein.

Proposed by Councillor Gleeson;

Seconded by Councillor Leddin;

Services Strategic Policy Committee dated 21st September, 2015, in relation to the

Limerick Privilege Card.

The report stated that Limerick Volunteer Centre (LVC) wished to roll out a

proposed the development of a discount-type card which LVC could distribute as a

reward to volunteers.

The scheme had been piloted in 2014 – over 100 organisations had applied

for the cards, over 7,000 volunteers were given cards and 85 businesses offered

discounts to card holders. The LVC was seeking the support of Limerick City and

County Council, in its civic leadership role, for the initiative. The Council’s logo

would be prominently displayed on the discount cards and used for all advertising.

Members, in welcoming this initiative, thanked Mr. Moriarty and stated that it

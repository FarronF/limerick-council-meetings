7Z Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting for an update on the proposals to address the
flooding issues in Foynes, Askeaton and Ballysteen.

when high spring tides were predicted. He requested that this item remain on the Agenda
and that Members be briefed on progress.

Councillor O’Brien, in seconding the Motion, requested that the OPW be written to seeking
clarification on the role and responsibility of the OPW £ in relation to tidal / flood
embankments within the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale and requested that the
OPW highlight the embankments in their charge. Members agreed to same and asked
that a further invitation be extended to a representative of the OPW to attend at a future
meeting of the District and expressed disappointment that a representative of the OPW
had not attended to-date.

In relation to Foynes, tenders are currently being assessed. It is expected
that a contractor will be recommended shortly. Construction should
commence soon thereafter subject to funding being made available from the
OPW.

In relation to other areas, including Ballysteen, any funding for these areas
will have to await national priorities following the CFRAMS studies by the

OPW.

Flood alleviation drainage works are currently being undertaken in Moig,
Ballysteen this week and should be completed shortly.

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting for an update on the provision of a new Sewerage
Treatment Plant in Askeaton.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan indicated that Askeaton town needed an
adequate sewerage treatment facility and that raw sewerage was being discharged into
the river Deel. He further stated that, as the current settlement beds were built in the
1940's, they did not cater for current usage. He added that residents had to vacate their
properties due to the foul smell and asked that this issue remain on the Agenda until it was
resolved.

REPLY: Consulting Engineers have been appointed by Irish Water to advance the
design of Askeaton Sewerage Scheme and initial meetings have already
taken place to consider the progress of the project.

On hearing the response, Councillor Sheahan welcomed the commitment of Irish Water to
the Project. The Motion was seconded by Councillor O'Brien who indicated that the issues
in Askeaton were ongoing for a considerable length of time and every effort should be
made to ensure Irish Water complete the works as soon as possible.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

| will move at the next Meeting that traffic-calming measures be installed in the
vicinity of Shanagolden National School, in the interest of public safety.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O'Donoghue and seconded by Councillor
McMahon. In proposing the Motion, Councillor O'Donoghue indicated that this was a
public safety issue and that children were at risk. Members supported the Motion and
noted that, when schools had expanded, adequate set-down areas should have been
provided for the increased volume of traffic.

REPLY: As outlined at the May Meeting of the District, the Senior Executive Engineer
and Area Technician met with members of the Shanagolden NS Parents’
Council Safety Committee in February. Since that meeting the Senior
Executive Engineer met again with members of the committee and the
school principal.

Line markings, as agreed, were completed at this time. The committee
proposed to prepare a plan for access to the school in the interests of health
and safety. The Senior Executive Engineer agreed that Limerick City and
County Council would carry out a survey to determine the feasibility of
constructing a footpath from the school to the junction with the L1223. The
Area Technician has been liaising with the Parents’ Council Safety
Committee's Engineer in relation to this.

10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

| will move at the next Meeting that adequate resources and staffing be provided to
the Adare-Rathkeale District Office to enable that office to deal efficiently with
Councillor representations.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O'Donoghue indicated that representations made by
Councillors for minor works were not carried out as speedily as other Area Offices and this
was due to a lack of funding and resources for the Rathkeale Area Office.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Neville indicated the importance of maintaining the
status of the Area Office in Rathkeale as the Municipal capital of the District, adding that it
should not be downgraded. Councillor Keary queried the possibility of minor works being
contracted out.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that general operatives would be recruited in the
next few months and that works were completed in order of priority.

REPLY: A new Grade II Technician and an Assistant Engineer were recently recruited
for the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District and we are currently endeavouring
to work through the backlog of Councillors requests for service within current
budgets. We are also currently looking at recruiting an Executive Engineer.

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council immediately take such necessary
measures to provide adequate parking in Adare town.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O'Brien indicated that parking in Adare was a major
issue and this problem was compounded by the collection of passengers travelling to
Dublin by the ‘Green Bus’ from the village.

Councillor Keary seconded the Motion and suggested that land at the heart of the village,
that had been deemed unsuitable for housing, be considered for parking. Councillor
Neville supported the Motion and added that, while parking was required for Adare, he did
not want the public to be of the opinion that Adare was not open for business. Councillor
Sheahan suggested that businesses be encouraged to use space at the rear of their
premises.

REPLY: The Adare Local Area Plan has an objective to facilitate the provision of
additional car parking. Such Area and Development Plan objectives are
advanced as funding or other resource opportunities become available.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

! will move at the next Meeting that Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District calls on the
Minister for Education to commit funding for the construction of a new secondary
school in Croom.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O'Brien who added that Croom was an important
town and the secondary school there should be promoted. The Motion was seconded by
Councillor O'Donoghue.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

| will move at the next Meeting that the pebbles in front of the houses at Friary
Court, Askeaton be replaced by a permanent surface.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Neville who indicated that he had met with a
number of residents of the estate. He expressed his concern that loose pebbles could
present a hazard when grass was being cut. The Motion was seconded by Councillor

Sheahan.

REPLY: The layout of the estate is such that the public footpaths serving the houses
are offset by 1.2 metres from the front of the houses. This 1.2 metre strip is
surfaced with pebbles and extends all round the rectangle serving houses 1

to 12.

The removal of the pebbles would have a negative impact on the visual
amenity of the estate.

However, more importantly it would also permit public access along the front
of each house and therefore lead to pedestrian access right along the front of
the houses all of which have bedrooms at the front. This will increase noise
levels in the bedrooms and may lead to antisocial behaviour, nuisance and
disturbance to tenants sleeping in the front rooms.

When surveying the estate | met with two residents, one of whom was in
favour of removing the pebbles and the other was opposed to their removal.

For all of the above reasons | recommend that the pebbles be retained.
Members expressed their dissatisfaction with the reply and the Director, Regional Services

suggested that all residents in houses 1-12 Friary Court, Askeaton be asked for their
opinion on the matter.

the achievements made by Croom Development Association, in conjunction with local
residents, which included the redevelopment of the Town Park and the construction of the
state of the art new Civic Centre building. They highlighted their future plans and indicated
that Croom Development Association was a non profit making organisation that had
charitable status and any profits made were redirected back into the community.

and the work achieved.

The following items were discussed at the conclusion of the Meeting.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that all avenues were being explored in relation to
drainage issues at Mrs. Lyons house.

In relation to the damaged dry wall at Church Street, across the road from the grotto, the
A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that there were insurance issues in relation to this
private wall and he would liaise further with the owner in relation to same. Councillor
Keary suggested that derelict sites legislation be considered in an effort to resolve this
issue. Councillor Keary also noted the need to clean-up the area from the Five Cross

Roads into Rathkeale.

Councillor Sheahan highlighted the need to spray the growth of weeds on the Sli na
Slainte route adjacent to the Askeaton Bypass and noted the illegal parking of caravans at
Churchview and the swimming pool Askeaton.

Councillor Keary highlighted the need to carry out an audit of halting sites, both official and
unofficial in the District. He noted the potential for overcrowding at halting sites over the
Christmas period, the risks associated with same and requested that sites be monitored
over the Christmas period. The A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that a review of
Council owned sites had already commenced.

Members agreed to request the Gardai to attend at the next District Meeting to discuss

Home, Community, Culture and Sport

**Part 8 Procedure** **–** **Franciscan Friary, Henry Street, Bedford Row, Limerick**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Home, Community, Culture and Sport dated 14th

October, 2015 along with the Chief Executives Report dated October, 2015 which was

prepared pursuant to Section 179 (3)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as

amended) and Part VIII of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001–2015 in

respect of proposed works at the Franciscan Friary, Henry Street, Bedford Row,

Limerick. It was proposed to proceed in accordance with the Chief Executives Report.

Members welcomed the proposed development and discussed previous commitments to

open a museum in King’s Island.

Members acknowledged the works carried out to improve the appearance of Nicholas

Street as an integral part of the tourist trail and discussed the need to make

improvements to the Fireplace Site at that location.

In response to queries the City and County Librarian clarified the following:

 The Franciscan Building was held by a Trust and the Council would continue to work

with the Trust.

 This was a signature building in a prime location and the redevelopment of the Friary

portion of the building into a museum served both to preserve a landmark building

and provide a museum at a reasonable cost.

 The project involved primarily internal works to the building at a budget of €0.5m. It

was hoped that works could commence in November or December of 2015 with

completion by March or April of 2016.

 It was intended to initially develop the Friary section of the building, followed by the

Church section which could be used as an open space for exhibitions or similar

events and it was anticipated that the building would form part of a cultural trail within

the city.

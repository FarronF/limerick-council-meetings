QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

| will ask at the next meeting, following my recent notice of motion, for an update on
the possibility of obtaining and refurbishing of derelict flats commonly known as the
“Newly Wed Flats” at the junction of Mary Street and Creagh Lane.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

| will move at the next meeting that the Council include Upper Gerald Griffin Street
for immediate upgrade along with the streets in the vicinity that are in the Plans at
present.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

| will move at the next meeting that all representative bodies that work in the city
centre are invited to participate on a committee to develop a night time strategy for
Limerick City centre.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

| will move at the next meeting that the Council will put a "Yellow Box" at the
junction of Lr. North Circular Road and Lr. Shelbourne Road, entering to the mini
roundabout. This would free up space and not block the exit, which happens at
present during the ‘school run’, in particular.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick request the
Government to put a 10% tax on chewing gum to be paid to the Council to clean up
the mess chewing gum makes on our streets.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

| will move at the next meeting that, in relation to the two lanes running westward
from the Dock Road roundabout, the inside lane be made a “left only lane" and the
outer one be made a "straight ahead lane".

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the
Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance for the introduction of real
rent controls, linking rents to inflation, to stop the sky-rocketing of rents currently

taking place.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Frankie Daly

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council undertake
meaningful consultation with residents and elected members when they are
planning to submit proposals for social housing to the various housing agencies.
The people have given a mandate to elected representatives to assist them with
local issues such as planning and it is not right for the council to make de-facto
decisions on where they want to build, with absolutely no input from, or no
consultation with, local residents.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the
Minister for Health to re-open the A&E units in St. John's, Ennis and Nenagh
Hospitals and the 1,600 hospital beds closed nationally since 2007 and provide the
extra staff urgently needed to solve the health crisis.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Marian Hurley

| will move at the next meeting that the Council look at options for safety and
junction improvements at Walker's Road/Lane, Castletroy, which leads on to the
main Dublin Road, R445.

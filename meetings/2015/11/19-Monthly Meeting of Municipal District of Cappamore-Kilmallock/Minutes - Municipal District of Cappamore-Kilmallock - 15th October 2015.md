is a traffic survey. This was undertaken in September, which is a

typical month for traffic movements and outside the seasonal variations

of the summer months. This data is currently being assimilated into the

traffic model which will be used to formally demonstrate a need for the

scheme and to subsequently build a business case for whichever

arrangement best addresses the junction issues. Different layout

options will be developed and assessed by the Engineering

Consultants before recommending a layout to be brought forward to

the detailed design and statutory processes stage. The design and

planning work overall is expected to take in the region of eighteen

months. However, the form of the revised layout is anticipated by

**Notice of Intention to advertise Part VIII for Parnell Street, Wickham Street and**

**Davis Street Urban Realm and Street Improvement Works**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Travel and Transportation dated 14th April, 2015.

Members welcomed the proposed development as a positive addition for the city that

would improve the first impressions of the city for those arriving at Colbert Station.

Members expressed the following views in relation to the proposed development.

 That traders have concerns at the loss of parking on Davis Street and Parnell Street

and that the routing of the cycle lane down Mallow Street should be considered as an

alternative to the existing proposal.

 That every effort be made to ensure the continuity of the affected businesses during

construction and a compromise be reached with regard to short term parking.

 While acknowledging the concerns of the traders, these must be balanced against

the needs of the city.

 It was hoped that this development would proceed in parallel with the redevelopment

of Colbert Station and Hyde Road Flats and in this regard Cluid should be invited to
---
attend a District Meeting to discuss same.

 That access to the adjacent Jackman Park be reviewed as part of the development.

 That works be carried out at Baker Place to repair damage that has taken place there

and bring it back to its previous standard.

 That any proposed changes to the design of the project be brought to the attention of

the Members.

In response to queries from Members, the Senior Engineer pointed out that the

proposed works would be advertised for three weeks, with six weeks allowed for

feedback. The project team would continue to meet with residents and traders and take

on board their concerns. He noted that Irish Rail were anticipated to commence their

works at Colbert Station within the following two months.

was continuously monitored and ahead of expectations. Twenty three stands were in

place, with the stand planned for Colbert Station held back in anticipation of the works to

Finance

**(a)**

**General Municipal Allocation**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Corporate Services, Human Resources and Change

Management dated 15th April, 2015 setting out proposals for expenditure.

Members acknowledged the positive discussions that had taken place at the Area

Forums in relation to traffic management allocations and special projects but expressed

dissatisfaction with the lack of consultation and discretion in relation to expenditure

detailed under D05 Tourism Development and Promotion. Members expressed concern

that the amount of €30,000 allocated under “Assistance for Maintenance of Open

Spaces” would be inadequate and leave the affected communities with no option but to

fundraise in order to bridge the gap between the amount of the grant and the actual cost

of grass cutting. Members welcomed the opportunity to allocate funding to special

projects at St. Munchin’s Community Centre, Garryowen Green and the Black Bridge in

Plassey and it was suggested that both the University of Limerick and Clare County

Council should contribute towards the Black Bridge Project.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Head of Finance clarified the following:

 In relation to marketing and branding it was important to make every effort to attract

businesses and tourists to Limerick and enhance its profile. The Council was

working with other agencies in this regard.

 It was not anticipated that any substantial funding would be made available to Local

Authorities arising from the sale of the former Anglo Irish Bank.

 The Development Fund could not be used for maintenance works such as grass

cutting and the amount allocated to grass cutting could be looked at again in 2016.

 Salting of roads was carried out because of the health and safety issues that arose

and these issues did not arise in relation to grass cutting.

 The GMA had already been agreed by the Members in October 2014 and included in

the budget for 2015.
---
Members agreed, on the proposal of Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor

O’Hanlon, to adjourn the meeting for five minutes.

On resumption of the meeting the Meetings Administrator clarified that a vote on this

item was not required as the District had already approved the GMA in October 2014.

He pointed out that the process would be reviewed for 2016, in conjunction with the

party leaders.

Members expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of discretion in relation to the

expenditure of elements of the GMA and it was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor

Leddin, seconded by Councillor Hurley, that Limerick Marketing come to a future

meeting of the District to present their proposals and plans in relation to venue branding

and special events.

**(b)**

**Schedule of Works for the Metropolitan District of Limerick**

Circulated, Report from the Director, Corporate Services, Human Resources and

Change Management dated 15th April, 2015, setting out the draft Schedule of Municipal

District Works for 2015.

Proposed by Councillor Leddin

Seconded by Councillor Butler

And Resolved;

“That the draft Schedule of Works for the Metropolitan District of Limerick 2015, as

circulated, be adopted”.

6.

Community

The Senior Social Worker (Home and Social Development) gave a presentation on the

Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) that included the following :

 The objectives set out in “Putting People First (Action Programme for Local

Government)” October 2012 with regard to the alignment of local government and

local development to bring about greater area-based collaboration for the range of

publicly funded local and community development programmes.

 The establishment of LCDCs as committees of the local authority under Part 6 of the

Local Government Reform Act 2014.

 The guiding principles, key provisions, responsibilities, members and current funding

programmes of the LCDC.

 The development of a six year local economic and community plan (LECP) and the

work to date of the LCDC.

 The role, functions, structure and work to date of the Public Participation Network.

Councillor Butler informed the meeting that he was a member of the LCDC which was

working to identify and address issues facing communities and to ensure a balance

between economic and social development. The committee was meeting monthly and

informing itself on issues relating to drugs, mental health, youth and unemployment,

amongst others.

Members raised the issue of private housing estates compared to council estates and

the contribution Part 5 agreements had made to bridge the gap between the two types of
---
estates. It was noted that the 20% allocation under Part 5 had been reduced to 10%

and a view was expressed that this was a regressive step.

In relation to access to schools it was noted that Minister Jan O’Sullivan had allocated a

maximum of 10% of spaces to the children of past pupils and this was welcomed.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Senior Social Worker clarified the

following :

 In relation to the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP),

following a procurement process, contracts for the operation of this programme were

awarded to PAUL Partnership, Ballyhoura Development Limited and West Limerick

Resources.

 It was anticipated that the PPN Secretariat would be in place within a week and the

steps to fill the remaining places on the Strategic Policy Committees could then

commence.

 The LCDC was obliged to submit an annual report to the full Council and would use

this to keep the Members informed of progress.

 With regard to the Local Economic and Community Plan, the community element of

the plan would be prepared by the LCDC and the economic element by the

Economic Development SPC. The Advisory Steering Group would oversee the

development of both strands of the plan.

7.

Home and Social Development

The Administrative Officer (Home and Social Development) gave an update to the

Members that included the following :

 Details of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) including qualification

requirements, benefits to the tenant and the landlord, numbers involved in the

scheme and associated cost, account movements in 2014 and targets and

challenges for 2015.

 The background and objectives of leasing, how property owners can become

involved, a comparison of RAS and leasing and details of property leased.

 The various types of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the range of AHBs operating

in Limerick and how the system operates.

Members thanked the Administrative Officer (Home and Social Development) for her

presentation and made the following points in response to same :

 That the money being paid in rent to private landlords would be better spent on the

provision of social housing.

 That tenants in receipt of state assistance towards the renting of private

accommodation do not have security of tenure and landlords are using the supposed

sale of their property as a way of moving to private tenants.

 There were up to six houses in the Moyross area, under the control of Respond, that

were boarded up. There was a large demand for housing in this area and Respond

should be requested to brief the Metropolitan District Members as to their proposals

for these houses.

 That rent caps are set too low and people are having difficulty sourcing affordable

private rented accommodation.
---
 That some housing applicants are seeking to be housed in particular areas only and

this requirement should be challenged.

 HAP will prove successful in that it does not discourage tenants taking up

employment.

 There are too many Approved Housing Bodies, leading to fragmentation in this area.

 That companies, acting as agents for landlords, are not passing on issues raised by

tenants.

On the proposal of Councillor O’Dea and seconded by Councillor Butler it was agreed

that standing orders be suspended to allow for the completion of the agenda.

In response to queries raised by Members the Administrative Officer (Home and Social

Development) clarified the following :

 The Council will make contact with Approved Housing Bodies to ensure stock is

being maximised and will invite an Approved Housing Body to a future meeting of the

District.

 While the Council is having difficulty sourcing new RAS accommodation, as it is

competing with the private market, some landlords are happy with the guarantee of

rent being paid.

 The Residential Tenancies Acts sets out standards in relation to the condition of

rental property. The Council can issue improvement notices under this legislation

and escalate to a higher process if necessary. The legislation also covers instances

where landlords decide to sell their property and in these instances, if sufficient

notice is given, the Council has no option but to accept that the property will be sold.

 Housing allocations are a complex process that seek to match accommodation

requirements, including location, of applicants to the stock available.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council introduce***

***pick up and drop parking spots for the main shopping streets to allow customers***

***to collect or drop off items to various businesses in the city where they would be***

***met by a staff member.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler stated that this proposal was intended to

facilitate one off purchases, increase the flow of traffic in the city and encourage the

purchase and payment of goods over the phone for subsequent collection.

In seconding the motion, Councillor Byrne indicated that this proposal would be suited to

niche businesses and a number of key locations for such parking spots should be

identified with this in mind.

Members supported the motion and made the following points in relation to same :

 Many shoppers park in Davis Street and Parnell Street to pick up goods but the

works proposed there will reduce this facility. While pedestrians and cyclists must be

facilitated, every effort must be made to facilitate businesses.

 The proposal has merit but will only work if the spaces are managed and this raises

the question as to who will monitor these spaces.

 Parking is an issue in all cities and the Council should consider requiring taxis to be
---
based off street in multi-storey car parks.

**REPLY**:

The City Centre has a finite amount of road space and different competing

needs are assigned to road space to allow the city to function both

commercially and in terms of moving traffic. Regulatory provisions enable

and provide for a multiplicity of traffic and parking requirements i.e., Bus

Stops, Coach Parking, Taxi Ranks, Loading Bays, pedestrian mobility,

cycle and car parking.

In the case of each of the above the various groups and representatives

would argue that not enough space is allocated to their services.

The current Parking Bye-Laws and the operating procedures for Limerick

City permit car users to park on-street for up to 10 minutes free to do quick

pick ups and drop offs. Traffic Wardens will not issue a fixed penalty notice

to a vehicle parked in a disc parking area for 10 minutes after monitoring a

vehicle that does not have paid for parking. This 10 minute grace period is

to allow motorists time to purchase parking discs or to do a quick pick-up

or drop-off.

The time a vehicle is discovered parking without a valid paid for Parking

Disc/Parkmagic is recorded electronically by Wardens and a fixed penalty

notice will not be issued for at least another 10 minutes. This period of

grace does not apply to vehicles parked illegally on double yellow lines, in

bus stops, etc.

Loading Bays also operate in the city that allow commercial vehicles to

load and unload for a maximum of 30 minutes while actively engaged.

Because parking control operating procedure currently permits a minimum

of 10 minutes grace period to motorists parked in on-street parking zones,

the Traffic Department do not believe there is any merit in introducing a

different type of on-street drop off and pick-up space or enforcement

procedure at this time and believe it would also create unnecessary

confusion for shoppers and visitors to the city.

Councillor Butler stated that he did not accept the points made in the reply and

suggested that the Council open its mind to alternative parking options that support

business.

It was agreed that the motion be discussed further at the Travel and Transportation SPC.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council write to Bus***

***Eireann to request they cease driving through Glencairn Estate, Raheen as part of***

***their 304 bus route in the interest of public safety.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

Members supported the motion and it was highlighted that part of the route referred to

had previously been a pedestrian walkway, widened to accommodate a car and was too
---
narrow to accommodate a bus safely. Issues were also raised with regard to the speed

at which buses take the corner at Ashbrook and the visibility of ramps at that location.

The need for discussions to take place with all residents, including those that might be

affected by an alternative route, was stressed.

As Items 10 and 11 were similar it was agreed that these motions would be taken

together.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council carries out as soon as possible a***

***dog fouling campaign, similar to the one organised last October/November to***

***highlight the dog fouling problem, which is a big issue in more areas across***

***Limerick and erects ‘No Dog Fouling’ signs where necessary and where***

***requested.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Byrne.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maria Byrne

***I will move at the next meeting, following the success of the TLC on Good Friday,***

***that Limerick Metropolitan District will start a scoop the poop awareness***

***campaign and place dog litter bins on the main roads to facilitate the campaign.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing her motion Councillor Secas highlighted the ongoing problem of dog fouling

and the need to emphasise to dog owners that this is an offence that will not be

tolerated.

In proposing her motion Councillor Byrne emphasised the need for dog litter bins in the

absence of normal bins on many main roads.

Members supported the motions and called on the public to challenge the behaviour of

dog owners who do not clean up after their dogs.

**REPLY**:

The Environment Department will start a scoop the poop awareness

campaign over the coming months.

The Environment Department will undertake a review of the current

location of “No Dog Fouling Signs” and will provide additional signage

where necessary.

The Environment Department found that the provision of dedicated dog

litter bins resulted in significant difficulties with bins overflowing and

difficulty in emptying. The current council policy is "any bag, any bin" which

allows dog owners use the existing bin network to dispose of dog litter. We

have found this policy to be the most effective in dealing with dog litter.

The Meetings Administrator undertook to establish if there was a budget for the supply of

new bins and it was clarified that any dogs rehomed from the Dog Control Centre in

Mungret are micro chipped and that the number of dogs rehomed from that location had
---
increased on foot of the efforts of the new kennel caretaker and the use of social media.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maria Byrne

***I will move at the next Metropolitan meeting that this Council give consideration to***

***the provision of free wifi on the centre city streets.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Byrne and seconded by Councillor Butler.

In proposing the motion Councillor Byrne pointed out that free wifi was available in most

European cities.

In seconding the motion Councillor Butler highlighted the benefits of wifi to tourists in

facilitating them to access the range of services and attractions available in the city and

region.

Councillor Quinlivan pointed out that the provision of free wifi may give rise to legal

issues under EU Regulations relating to anti competitiveness.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City & County Council is presently considering the provision of a

free pilot WiFi area in the City Centre. Following an evaluation of this pilot

initiative further consideration will be given to the provision of free WiFi

in other City Centre streets.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council provide details of***

***inspections under the Fire Services and Licensing Acts carried out on all***

***premises and apartment blocks in the Metropolitan Area in the last year and give***

***details of any issues found and the follow up procedures.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh pointed out that he was seeking

information in relation to fire safety issues for apartment blocks and details of maximum

capacity and during performance inspection for licenced premises and clubs and any

follow up action taken.

The Meetings Administrator informed the Members that the Chief Fire Officer had

submitted a detailed report in reply to the motion and he would circulate same to

Members.

In reply to queries raised by Members the Chief Fire Officer clarified the following :

 There was no obligation on premises to display Fire Safety Certificates but details in

relation to maximum capacity should be on display.

 Licence details granted to Dance Halls / Discos were on the public record in the

District Court.

 Any issues brought to the attention of the owners of premises, not dealt with, would

be reflected in the Chief Fire Officer’s report to the Licencing Court.

 Fire Safety Certificates apply to relevant buildings, newly built or refurbished since
---
1990 under the Building Control Act.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Maurice Quinlivan

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council has a briefing session for elected***

***members with senior management to update the elected members on the***

***progress of the Limerick 2030 plan, following the decision of An Bord Pleanála to***

***grant permission to Horizon Mall application.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan and seconded by Councillor

McCreesh.

Members supported the motion and expressed concern at the implications of the Bord

Pleanála decision for the 2030 Plan and proposed developments at the Opera Centre.

The following views were also expressed by Members :

 That the Members be provided with details of the retail element of plans for the

Opera Centre and an update on the retail plan for the city and whether there is

funding to implement the plan.

 Resulting from the Bord Pleanála decision, the Council should look creatively at key

issues, such as parking, and not place an over reliance on retail as part of our

strategy, going forward.

 That Members were disappointed at not being consulted prior to the recent

announcement relating to the Opera Centre.

**REPLY**:

The management team are currently reviewing the decision of An Bord

Pleanála in respect of the Horizon Mall including any possible impact on

the delivery of the projects outlined in Limerick 2030. On completion of this

review a briefing session will be arranged for all councillors.

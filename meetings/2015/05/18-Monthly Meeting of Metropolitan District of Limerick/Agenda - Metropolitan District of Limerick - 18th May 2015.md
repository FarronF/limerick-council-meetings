NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

| will move at the next Metropolitan meeting that the council undertake a review of
the properties on the approach to Limerick City Centre via the Dock Road with
regard to improving the unsightly appearance of this roadway.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

| will move at the next meeting that we write to the Ministers for Environment and
Justice explaining how attempts by our predecessor, the Limerick City Council, to
bring water charge boycotters to court failed to break non-payment, and calling on
them to scrap draconian plans to bring water bill non-payers to court in order to
get attachment orders. In that letter we should encourage them to follow the
example of the old Limerick City Council and abandon the water charges, and
instead fund the service through progressive taxation.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

| will move at the next meeting that the Council and Regeneration exert every
effort to ensure the supermarket at Vvatchhouse Cross does not remain
vacant and that this important service for the community is restored. We should
request a progress report for the June meeting.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller

| will move at the next meeting that we write to Bus Eireann calling on them to
relocate the following bus stops:

1) Ballysimon Road - beside the Woodlawn Park entrance inward bound
2) Dublin Road - St Patrick's Road - Cherryville Junction next to Maxol
Station outward bound

on the grounds of safety for pedestrians, restrictions to traffic flow, and general
road safety for all users.

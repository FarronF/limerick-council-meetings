voiced their support for the disposal and for the development of the Gasification

Plant.

Standing Orders for Strategic Policy Committees

Circulated, report of the Meetings Administrator dated 18th March, 2015,

attaching Draft Standing Orders for Meetings of Strategic Policy Committees.

The report referred to Guidelines received in relation to the formulation of the

Strategic Policy Committees which stated that Standing Orders for SPCs were

required to be approved by the Full Council. Also, in accordance with Section 54(2)

of the Local Government Act, 2001, the Council was obliged to comply with the

Guidelines. The Corporate Policy Group, at its meeting on 16th March, 2015, agreed

that the Draft Standing Orders would be placed before the Council for approval. The

Standing Orders could then be considered by the Strategic Policy Committees at

their next Meeting and suggested amendments, if any, would then be brought back

to Full Council for consideration.

A resolution of the Council was now required to adopt the Standing Orders.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Collins

(M), it was agreed to amend SPC Standing Orders as follows: “that meetings should

be held at least two weeks in advance of bi-monthly meetings so as to accommodate

Motions moved at full Council level and, as a consequence, SPC Meetings will total

six Meetings a year.”
---

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Collins (M);

And Resolved:

“That, Standing Orders for Strategic Policy Committee Meetings, as

circulated, be and are hereby adopted, subject to the amendment outlined above.”

(d)

Standing Orders – Full Council

Circulated, report of the Meetings Administrator dated 18th March, 2015.

The report referred to Standing Orders for the Full Council adopted at Meeting

held on 22nd September, 2014. The Corporate Policy Group was recommending that,

in relation to a Chairperson’s Report from a Strategic Policy Committee, the

Members of that particular SPC would not be allowed to speak on the Report as they

would have had the opportunity at SPC Meetings to speak on the issues contained in

the Chairperson’s Report. This recommendation would require the following

amendment to Standing Orders:

***“Members of an SPC will not be allowed to speak on the Chairman’s***

***Report of the SPC. Where a Recommendation from an SPC is materially***

***amended at the Council Meeting, all Members will be permitted to***

***speak.”***

In accordance with Paragraph 16 of Schedule 10 of the Local Government

Act, 2001, a resolution of the Council was required to amend Standing Orders.

Following debate on the issue of whether Members would be allowed to

speak on the Chairperson’s Report of the SPC at a Council Meeting, it was agreed

that the proposed amendment would be altered to include the word ‘ordinarily’ and

therefore the amendment would read as follows:

***“Members of an SPC will not ordinarily be allowed to speak on the***

***Chairman’s Report of the SPC. Where a Recommendation from an SPC***

***is materially amended at the Council Meeting, all Members will be***

***permitted to speak.”***

During further discussion on Standing Orders and, in particular, the issue of

Members’ Motions being referred to Strategic Policy Committees, a further

amendment to Standing Orders was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded

by Councillor Keary, and agreed as follows:

**“That the proposer of a Motion placed on the Clár be allowed to move**

**said Motion and that the said Motion be allowed to be seconded. The**

**mover of said Motion be allowed to attend the relevant Strategic Policy**

**Committee Meeting that the Motion is referred to if not already a**

**Member.”**

NOTICES OF MOTION

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council condemn***

***the current system of accommodating asylum seekers in Ireland, known as***

***Direct Provision, and calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances***

***Fitzgerald, TD, to: (1) immediately close Mount Trenchard Direct Provision***

***Centre in Foynes which has been widely described as the worst in the system***

***and is not fit for purpose; and (2) commit to abolishing the Direct Provision***

***system by the end of 2015.***

Councillor Prendiville, in proposing the Motion, stated that his Party was

totally opposed to the Direct Provision System which denied people the right to a

home or a job. He referred to Mount Trenchard in Foynes and said it was

overcrowded with up to 8 adults per room and also that there was a lack of

recreational facilities. He said that the residents there felt very isolated as the

nearest village was 5 kilometres away. He concluded by calling for the immediate

closure of the Mount Trenchard Facility stating that it was not fit for purpose and that

the 45 people currently living there could be accommodated in the three other

centres in Limerick.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Quinlivan and unanimously agreed.

With the permission of the Mayor, the following Motion was taken as this time:

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on***

***the Government to (i) immediately and adequately resource An Garda***

***Síochána to deal with the issue of prostitution and (ii) enact the Criminal Law***

***(Sexual Offences) Bill, 2014, which will serve to change the law to criminalise***

***the purchase of sex and, as such, target the demand element of this industry.***

Councillor Lynch stated that he wished to make an amendment to the wording

of the Motion to read as follows:

**“I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council**

**call on the Government to immediately and adequately support services**

**for victims of prostitution and to provide assistance to help those who**

**wish to exit the industry.”**

Councillor Lynch, in proposing the amended Motion, stated that prostitution

was a serious crime and that he was calling for the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences)

Bill, 2014, to become law. He added that a dedicated Garda Unit was essential to

enforce the law and he called for one to be set up in each Garda Division. He

concluded by acknowledging the work of Doras Luimní and others in assisting the

victims of prostitution and trafficking and stressed the need for additional resources

to provide the structure of counselling and services that these victims required.

The Motion, as amended, was seconded by Councillor Collins (M).

During debate on the Motion, Councillor Prendiville proposed the following

amendment and this was seconded by Councillor Loftus:

“I will move that the Council would call on the Department of Justice and

Equality to ensure that any legal measures to cut across demand for the sex

industry are accompanied by corresponding measures to (i) invest in support

services for prostitutes/sex workers that offer multi-lingual services such as

healthcare, contraception, English language lessons, counselling, access to

specially trained Gardai to report violence, sexual violence or theft, and (ii)

ensure every woman, man or trans-person who is a prostitute/sex worker who

wishes to exit the sex industry is aided to do so by State services that provide

housing, jobs or training and to ensure that no woman, man or trans-person

working in the sex industry is deported.”

A vote in the form of a show of hands was taken on the amendment proposed

by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Loftus. The Mayor declared the

amendment defeated as there was not a majority in favour.

Accordingly, the Mayor declared the Motion as proposed by Councillor Lynch

and seconded by Councillor Collins (M) carried.

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council would support the call to have***

***the Voluntary Health Insurance (VHI) give its full support to the proposal to***

***have a Private Community Hospital built at the Dock Road, Limerick.***

The Mayor, Councillor Sheahan (K), in proposing the Motion, stated that the

planning permission was in place for the proposed 92 bed private hospital with six

operating theatres for the Dock Road, Limerick. He added that a flood risk

assessment had been undertaken, an operator for the facility was in place and that

the funding to build the facility was available. He went on to state that in the previous

few months, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (VHI) had stipulated that an

existing private bed in the region would have to close for every new one in the new

hospital before they would sign up for the proposed new private hospital.

Councillor O’Donoghue seconded the Motion and said that there was a

demand for more beds in the Region.

Councillor Joe Leddin stated that the VHI should be given an opportunity to

give their side on this issue.

On the proposal of Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Ó Ceallaigh, it

matter.

and accordingly the Mayor declared the Motion carried

options that had been given to employees were voluntary or compulsory redundancy

to refuse to engage with the Union of the workers’ choice in order to explore options

to retain the jobs in question.

workers and management at Dunnes Stores was an issue of major relevance to the

Council as there were 4 Dunnes Stores shops in the Metropolitan District with

hundreds of workers living and working in Limerick. He asked for the Council’s

support in building better and fairer workplaces in Limerick by endorsing the call on

Dunnes Stores employees.

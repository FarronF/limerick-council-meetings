Twinning Visit to USA

The Mayor addressed the Meeting in relation to this item. He stated that he was

proposing to visit Boston following receipt of an invitation from his counterpart there,

Mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh. He outlined the purpose of the trip which was to try

and

formalise

a

twinning

arrangement

between

Limerick

and

Boston,

Massachusetts. He said it was a requirement under the Local Government Act,

2001, to obtain the approval of the Council for such visits.

Councillor Prendiville, on behalf of his Party, raised queries in relation to cost,

duration of the visit and itinerary.

The Mayor stated that the visit was for 3 days and that he hoped it would yield

benefits for Limerick in the areas of tourism, culture, community and economic

development. The Mayor also informed the Meeting that there were now daily flights

between Shannon and Boston and that this should have a positive effect for tourism

in both cities.

In reply to the query on cost, the Meetings Administrator stated that the visit by the

Mayor and 1 official would cost approximately €5,100.00.

Following further discussion on the twinning visit, a vote was taken in the form of a

show of hands. The majority of the Members were in favour of the visit. 3 Members

indicated that they were abstaining from the vote.

Proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon;

Seconded by Councillor Donegan;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to Twinning Visit to

Boston, Massachusetts, in accordance with Section 142(5)of the Local Government

Act, 2001.”

Age-Friendly Limerick

The Mayor welcomed Ms. Mary Killeen-Fitzgerald, Project Manager, Limerick Age-

Friendly Initiative, and Mr. Dara McGuigan, Administrative Officer, Community, to the

Meeting and invited them to give a presentation on Limerick Age-Friendly Strategy.

It was stated that an age-friendly world enabled people of all ages to actively

participate in community activities and treated everyone with respect, regardless of

their age, and many cities and communities were taking active steps towards

becoming more age-friendly.

The Project Manager referred to the Limerick Age-Friendly Strategy and elaborated

on the proposed Actions, the Lead Partner and, where relevant, the Support

Partners for each of the Themes covered in the Presentation.

A comprehensive PowerPoint Presentation was made under the following World

Health Organisation (WHO) Themes:

• **Theme 1 - Outdoor Spaces and Public Buildings:**

*“Physical environments that were Age-Friendly could make the difference*

*between independence and dependence for all people, but especially for*

*those growing older.”*

• **Theme 2 - Transportation:**

*“Research showed that transport for older people was linked to*

*independence, autonomy and quality of life.”*

• **Theme 3 - Housing:**

*“Research on quality of life found that older people felt their homes and*

*neighbourhoods had a strong influence on the quality of their lives and that*

*most people wanted to grow old in their own homes.”*

• **Theme 4 - Respect and Social Inclusion:**

*“The postitive impacts of social connections and social networks were well*

*known and several international reports had shown that all people, regardless*

*of age, who had active social networks, tended to feel happier about their*

*lives.”*

• **Theme 5 - Social Participation:**

*“Information was key to allowing older people to avail of social objectives in*

*their communities.”*

• **Theme 6 - Communication and Information:**

*“Research highlighted the importance of staying connected with people and*

*getting timely information to manage life and meet personal needs for active*

*ageing.”*

• **Theme 7 - Civic Participation:**

*“Ensuring the voice of the older person was embedded in the age-friendly*

*process.”*

• **Theme 8 - Community Support & Health Services:**

*“Increased longevity was largely an outcome of improvements in health care,*

*lifestyles and diet. As a result, providing health care for older people required*

*the collaboration of a number of different professionals.”*

At the conclusion of the Presentation, a large number of Members contributed to the

discussion and thanked both officials for their very comprehensive presentation.

It was noted that the launch of the Age-Friendly Strategy 2015-2020 would take

place on 12th May, 2015, and that a separate notification for the event would issue to

the Members in due course.

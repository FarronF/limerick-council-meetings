! will ask at the next Meeting when will both Hospital and Caherconlish

staffing shortages.

at short notice it was necessary to temporarily close both Libraries.

In order to provide a service the Mobile Library service has been
deployed in both areas on a weekly basis.

The service will operate as follows:

e Each Monday afternoon 2pm - 4pm in Caherconlish, (the church car
park).

e Every Friday afternoon 2pm - 4pm in Hospital, (adjacent to

Programme.

operators.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Foynes Flying Boat & Maritime

Museum which consisted of Margaret O’Shaughnessy, Director, Foynes Flying Boat &

Maritime Museum, Brid Moriarty and Tadhg Moriarty, Approved Productions, Event

Management Company.

Ms. Margaret O’Shaughnessy indicated that the Air Show of 2014 celebrated the 75th

anniversary of the first commercial transatlantic crossing into Foynes and attracted 20,000

spectators costing €115,000. She indicated that, based on last year’s success, they were

planning a similar event in either July or early August 2015 and it was estimated the air

show would cost in the region of €140,000. She requested funding from Limerick City and

County Council of €50,000 and stated that the remainder of the money would be

generated through sponsorship.

Members commended the Delegation for its presentation.

4.

Environment and Water

Gortadroma Landfill

The Head of Finance indicated that Limerick City and County Council had received a draft

Lease Agreement for review and once reviewed would be issued to Cadence EnviroPower

for consideration. He indicated that Cadence EnviroPower’s proposal needed to meet the

current requirements of the Government Energy Programme called ‘REFIT 3’ (Renewable

Energy Feed in Tariff). The main element of this was that Cadence EnviroPower’s plant

would need to be operational by September 2016. He added that Limerick City and

County Council gave a presentation on 8th December to the local residents group detailing

the scale of the facility and listed similar projects. The local residents group indicated that

they would like to discuss the proposal further and requested a meeting with Cadence

EnviroPower.

Members requested that they be provided with timeframe and deadlines for all stages of

the proposed lease agreement for Gasification Plant at Gortadroma Landfill. Councillor

Sheahan proposed that a delegation, which would be funded by Cadence EnviroPower,

from Limerick City and County Council together with representative from the local

community should view a similar plant. This was seconded by Councillor McMahon

QUESTIONS

6.

Question submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update in relation to urgent safety measures***

***required on the N20 from Anahid Cross to O'Rourke's Cross.***

**REPLY:**

Following the Notice of Motion raised by Cllr. O’Donoghue at the November

Plenary Council Meeting, the Director of Travel and Transportation wrote to

the National Roads Authority (NRA) on the matter raised above. The Council

is currently awaiting a response from the NRA in this regard.

7.

Question submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a full list of vacant properties under the ownership***

***of Limerick City & County Council, in the Adare-Rathkeale area, to be provided***

***without delay to all Councillors in this area - the list of properties to include all***

***houses, apartments and premises regardless of condition or state of repair.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City & County Council have 4 vacant buildings in the Adare-

Rathkeale area. These are

 Former Library & Community Centre at Ballyhahill, Loughill,

 Building at Stoneville, Riddlestown, Rathkeale.

 Site acquired under the Derelict Site Act at Main Street, Rathkeale

 Former Court House at Blackabbey, Adare

**The above list does not include properties under the control of the Home & Social**

**Development Department.**

8.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Neville

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the following requests made by the***

***Adare Community Council for (a) a push button pedestrian crossing to replace the***

***existing pedestrian crossing in Adare (b) the realigning of the roads in the village of***

***Adare.***

**REPLY:**

(a)

The NRA has been consulted in relation to the pedestrian crossing at

Adare and is not in favour of changing the existing crossing to a

signalised crossing.

(b)

Requests were made previously for road markings to be refreshed at

various locations around the village, in particular at the Station Road

junction. Road markings were refreshed in the village in 2014 as part

of the Area Offices maintenance programme. There is one junction

box on the Rathkeale Road that is scheduled to be refreshed as soon

as weather permits.

Councillor Neville queried the rationale for refusing the push button pedestrian crossing in

Adare and Members indicated that the response from the National Roads Authority (NRA)

was unacceptable.

It was agreed to send a letter to the National Roads Authority seeking a meeting to discuss

a pre-agreed list of road issues relevant to the District. It was further agreed that a number

of Members from the District would attend this Meeting.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a report regarding***

***(a) The provision of a pedestrian crossing at or near White's Shop, New Line,***

***Rathkeale.***

***(b) The results of the recent traffic count which was carried out in the vicinity of***

***White's Shop.***

**REPLY:**

A traffic count and a survey of pedestrian crossing movements were carried

out last September. The traffic count revealed that there is an AADT (Annual

Average Daily Traffic) of 3113 on the R518. The pedestrian counts were

carried out to cover school opening and closing times and also covered the

lunchtime period. The pedestrian count in the morning showed 35 crossing

movements, 17 movements at lunchtime and 63 movements in the

afternoon. The analysis of the survey in accordance with current design

guidelines indicates that a warrant for a pedestrian crossing in this area does

not exist. However, given the unquestioned desire line for access to the

town centre from the school together with the school being located on a

significant regional road, a controlled crossing facility in the vicinity of Whites

garage could be justified. The cost of providing a crossing in this area would

be in the order of €30k.

Currently there is no funding source available to the Council for the provision

of pedestrian crossings. Perhaps consideration could be given to fund

crossings through the General Municipal Allocation. It should be noted

however that there are numerous requests for controlled crossings at

schools across the Municipal District and indeed across the county.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an*** ***explanation as to why Limerick City and County***

***Council did not accept Shannon Foynes Port Company’s Consulting Engineers***

***Report, through an agreed Framework Agreement, in circumstances where these***

***Engineers had carried out an assessment of existing flood defences and prepared a***

***detailed design for flood defences.***

**REPLY:**

Funding was approved by the OPW on the 29th May 2014. Shannon Foynes

Port Company (SFPC) had a framework in place with Consulting Engineers

for minor works in the port. This framework expired on the 1st May 2014 and

therefore could not be used for this scheme.

It should be noted that a detailed design was not carried out by the SFPC's

Consulting Engineers. Some preliminary sketches were done but the

detailed studies and assessments were not undertaken. The SFPC's

Consulting Engineers did tender for the advertised scheme but were not

successful. The most economically advantageous tender was selected in

accordance with procurement procedures.

Members expressed their dismay at the lack of progress in providing proper flood

defences for the Foynes area, a year on from the devastating floods and asked that

pressure be applied to Government to provide funding for same. Members queried the

necessity of obtaining consultant engineers to draw up designs for flood defences, adding

that this was only slowing down the entire process.

The Head of Finance indicated that the Council does not have the resources in-house to

provide the detailed design and on occasions outside consultants are commissioned. He

added that a procurement process needed to be followed.

NOTICE OF MOTION

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

***I will move at the next Meeting that lighting be erected on the N21 to cover the***

***flyover and junctions entrances to Rathkeale which are highly dangerous given the***

***volume of traffic on the road.***

Councillor Neville, in proposing the Motion, stated that a number of accidents have

occurred at these junctions and highlighted the benefit of well lit junctions to prevent

accidents.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keary.

**REPLY:**

The request for the installation of public lighting on the N21 at the Rathkeale

interchange has been forwarded to the National Roads Authority for their

consideration. They have informed the Council that this location currently

does not feature on their accident record register. It should be noted that it is

not common practice to install public lighting on at-grade junctions on single

carriageway roads in the absence of an accident record.

12.

Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Neville

***I will move at the next Meeting that speed ramps be replaced and further*** ***enhanced***

***in St. Mary's Park, Rathkeale.***

Councillor Neville, in proposing the Motion, stated that a number of existing ramps in St.

Mary’s Park, Rathkeale were insufficient and high powered cars were able to drive over
---

them with ease. Members expressed the view that tarmac ramps were more efficient in

reducing speed than the rubber-pad ramps.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

**REPLY:**

This motion should be considered in the context of Circular RSD 01/2014

issued recently by DTTAS. The circular asks Local Authorities to undertake

a review process of speed limits in housing estates. In effect the circular is

suggesting the use of 30kph speed limits in Housing Estates with signage to

be accompanied by the yellow warning sign "Children At Play". If such an

approach was adopted in Limerick City and County Council it should be

monitored and reviewed and only those estates where it was shown that the

speed limit was not being adhered to would be considered for the

introduction of further calming measures, including ramps. It is proposed to

undertake such a review in the coming months in conjunction with a general

review of speed limits.

In addition, it should be noted that the Council is currently in discussion with

An Garda Siochana in relation to agreeing locations for some traffic calming

measures in Rathkeale.

It is noted the existing ramps in St Mary’s Park may be too narrow and we

will investigate the possibility of extending these to make them more suitable

for the purposes of slowing traffic.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors K. Sheahan and E.

O’Brien

***We will move that the Council commence the process to have the name of the road***

***between Pallaskenry Village and the Salesian College called the Saint Don Bosco***

***Road. This year is the 200**th*** ***Anniversary of the birth of Saint Don Bosco.***

Councillor Sheahan, in proposing the Motion, asked that the existing road number be

retained.

Councillor O’Brien seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

If the Motion is agreed, the Council will order the nameplates and erect them

on delivery.

The Motion was agreed by Members and the Operations Manager South & West Division

indicated that the nameplate would be erected.

QUESTIONS

3.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting if immediate action could be taken to mend the very***

***significant pot holing evident at Nash’s Lane, Newcastle*** ***West, in the interests of***

***safety and local connectivity.***

**REPLY:**

The lane in question, even though utilised by the public, is in private ownership.

It was due to be developed as part of the proposed Planning Permission for the

Aldi site. Accordingly, the Council is not in a position to carry out the remedial

works as proposed.

Members outlined that the laneway was extremely busy, particularly as it lead to the

Demesne, and they requested that the Council carry out remedial works as a matter of

urgency in the interests of safety.

4.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an up-date on the bridge repairs at the Creamery***

***Mountcollins.***

**REPLY:**

Repair works to the bridge parapet walls were carried out recently by Kerry

County Council at this location. The works involved the replacement of

missing stone and wall cappings. These works have now been completed.

5.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting that the footpath be repaired outside Greyhound and***

***Pet World, Abbeyfeale, as it is in a dreadful and dangerous condition.***

**REPLY:**

The above will be considered under the National Roads Budget for Capital

Works in 2015. The Programme of Works will be brought before the

Municipal District for consideration.

Members outlined the importance of repairing the footpath as it was in a very dangerous

condition and was used on a regular basis by fitness groups in the town. Members

suggested that the repair of footpaths, particularly those in very poor repair, needed to be

considered for inclusion under the National Roads Budget.

6.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting if signage for Monagea could be put in place at the***

***junction of the L2013 with the N21*** ***at Annie O’Connell’s Corner, Newcastle West.***

The above signage will be ordered and will be erected once it is delivered.

NOTICES OF MOTION

7.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Area Office undertake an inventory of the***

***various empty grave spaces at Calvary so as to ensure an orderly burial system is***

***maintained within the Cemetery.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan reiterated the need to undertake an inventory

of empty grave spaces at Calvary Cemetery.

Councillor Sheahan seconded the Motion.

The Director outlined that grave spaces currently purchased were not allocated to

individuals until the grave spaces were required. He stated that this alleviated the problem

of empty grave spaces dotted throughout the Cemetery.

**REPLY:**

The Council maintains a register of all grave spaces allocated in Calvary

Cemetery and these records are available for inspection at Environment

Department, Council Offices, Dooradoyle, Limerick. The burial ground

caretaker, Mr. Pat Dalton, 19 Church Street, Newcastle West, also has a

register of grave spaces allocated in Calvary Cemetery.

8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that tap water be provided at those Cemeteries***

***currently without one and that a bin collection service be put in place, where***

***necessary.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan outlined the importance of the continuation of

the provision of water and a bin collection service at all Cemeteries throughout the County

and the need to provide these services at Cemeteries currently without them.

Councillor Galvin seconded the Motion.

Members stated that the bin collection service at Monagea had been suspended and that

Ardagh Cemetery had no tap water.

**REPLY:**

There are approximately 240 graveyards in County Limerick. Each

graveyard would need to be assessed separately for the provision of a water

supply. The costs involved would include piping the water, hire of machinery,

labour costs, material costs and possible road crossing. It is also necessary

to make an application to Irish Water for each water connection. The

estimated cost of each water connection would be €500 to €1,000 but would

vary depending on the distance the water would need to be piped. In

addition, there would be ongoing maintenance costs and ongoing payments

to Irish Water for water supply. Unfortunately, the Council has a small budget

for the maintenance and upgrade of graveyards and finance is not available

for the provision of public water taps as requested.

The Council has provided a bin service in the active cemeteries. However,

the Council will arrange to carry out a review of bin services provided in

cemeteries and arrange for bin service to be provided where necessary and

as budgets permit.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the roadway from the two filling stations***

***Killarney Road to Dalton’s Cross on the N21 Abbeyfeale be:***

***(a) resurfaced***

***(b) realigned with stacking lanes for the estates and the town park to be***

***provided.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stressed the need to provide stacking lanes

between the two filling stations Killarney Road to Dalton’s Cross on the N21. He stated

that this was an extremely busy road in a built up area and that it could be very dangerous,

particularly at night.

Councillor Foley seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

All surfacing/road marking on National Roads is funded and authorised by

the National Roads Authority. This request is now forwarded to the NRA

Regional Inspector for his consideration.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the footpath be extended from Abbey United***

***Soccer Club to the Railway Yard to facilitate pedestrians using the Great Southern***

***Trail in the interest of safety.***

Councillor Galvin proposed and Councillor Browne seconded the Motion.

Members stated that the Great Southern Trail was a very important local facility and that

the extension of the footpath was essential in the interest of safety for individuals and

families using the trail. Members asked if funding could be sought from the National

Transport Authority.
---
5

**REPLY:**

The provision of a footpath at this location will cost in the region of €30,000.

This could be considered under the Development Fund for 2015. In addition,

an application can be made to the National Transport Authority for funding as

complementing the Great Southern Trail extension to Listowel.

Councillor Collins requested that a list of burial ground caretakers in the District be

circulated to Members.

Members raised concerns about the humpback bridge on the R521 at Cois Teampaill,

Newcastle West, and the lack of footpaths on the eastern side of the road. They stated

that it was very narrow at the bridge, with restricted visibility, and was unsuitable for either

safe walking or cycling. Members suggested the provision of stone markings on the

roadway for drivers and/or the erection of a “dangerous bridge” sign. They also queried if

a Compulsory Purchase Order could be considered as some of the land was in private

ownership.

The issue of funding towards the provision of Christmas lights was again discussed and

Members suggested that a capital investment be made towards the provision of Christmas

lights in 2015. It was agreed that this issue would be raised as part of the Budget process.

Members unanimously agreed that they were opposed to the charging of 50% of rates on

vacant properties.

Members requested that the Superintendent, Newcastle West, be invited to attend the

February Meeting to give an update on policing for the District, to include the issue of boy

racers. In particular, they made reference to the problems experienced with boy racers on

Christmas Day in the town of Abbeyfeale.

Deputation from Tournafulla Sustainable Living Community

Councillor Collins indicated that a request to receive a Deputation had been received from

Tournafulla Sustainable Living Community. On the proposal of Councillor Collins,

seconded by Councillor Scanlan, it was agreed to receive a Deputation from Tournafulla

Sustainable Living Community at the next monthly Meeting to be held on 4th February,

2015.

Deputation from Newcastle West Arts Committee

Members were informed that a request to receive a Deputation had been received from

Newcastle West Arts Committee. On the proposal of Councillor Collins, seconded by

Councillor Scanlan, it was agreed to receive a Deputation from Newcastle West Arts

Committee at the next monthly Meeting to be held on 4th February, 2015.

Conyers and that Sarah McCutcheon, Executive Archaeologist, be invited to attend.

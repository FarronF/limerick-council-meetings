QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

| will ask at the next meeting what progress if any has been made with the derelict
site opposite Punch's Hotel and formerly the site of John Moloney Garage, which
has planning permission for a commercial development, and what the current
ownership structure is.

Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

| will ask at the next meeting as to who is the current owner of the site at the
junction of Upper Gerald Griffin Street and Wickham Street, which is totally
overgrown and derelict in the heart of our city centre, with a view to totally clearing
this site.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately
prepare an Urban Renewal Scheme and Plan for the Village of Patrickswell, similar
to that recently completed in Mungret, in consultation with the local stakeholders
and submits it for planning approval and that the Council allocate or arrange the
necessary finance to fund the scheme, having sought contractor tenders.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

| will move at the next meeting that the grass cutting schedules for the 3 electoral
areas of the Metropolitan District of Limerick be presented to Members before the
season begins so that Members can ensure the schedule is effective.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler

| will move at the next meeting that the Council put a yellow box junction at the

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately
tackle all the hedging issues on the North Circular Road and other areas throughout
the North Side. Many of the hedges are forcing pedestrians to walk on the
roadways and if these cannot be addressed directly, because they are on private
property, the appropriate enforcement should be issued to the owners to carry out
the works.

In addition, there are many trees that need to be removed due to damage and also
height issues in many places, photographs of such trees can be provided. There is
a huge decline in local amenity areas and the Council should draw up and
implement an immediate action plan to improve the overall appearance of these
areas.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Crowley

| will move at the next meeting that the Council provide a "Prayer Garden” in the city
as a place where people experiencing tragic loss or those who are in despair can
come to visit in privacy. With suicide so prevalent in Limerick, this would be a
location not only for victims but may indeed provide a sanctuary for those who may
be in peril themselves. | feel that a city centre site is crucial, suitable and
necessary and suggest the old Graveyard in Michael Street. Once we can secure
this or an alternative site, we can see about developing it.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

| will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District arrange to meet
with the management of Shannon Foynes Port Company with a view to addressing
the current unsightly build up of scrap metal in Limerick Docks which is a total
eyesore for the local community, especially visitors staying in the local hotel, and
agree a new strategy for dealing with this type of material.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

| will move at the next meeting that this Council remove, or have removed, the
rubbish dump which lies between the Castle Wall and the river.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhir. Séighin 6 Ceallaigh

| will move at the next meeting that the Council hold an ‘Oiche Gaeilge’ or ‘Irish
Language Night’ in City Hall between 1st and 16th March 2015 as part of Seachtain
na Gaeilge with refreshments and food provided for anyone who wishes to come to
the event to speak in Irish with other Irish speakers and that a similar event be
held annually during Seachtain na Gaeilge. The event should be open to all,
whether fluent speakers or beginners, wishing to improve their Irish.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan

| will move at the next meeting that this Council resolve to work in a positive manner
with the community centre in Caherdavin to operate a viable library in their building
and that a review of this process take place in the Autumn of this year.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick supports the
Caherdavin Residents Association's request to keep the Caherdavin Library open
for a 6 month trial. Over that 6 months the library can be housed on the ground floor
of the community centre, if needs be. This trial period can give space for the library
to develop a clear and important role within the Limerick Library Services, or at least
develop with the community proposals for alternative services. At the end of this trial
period, a review should take place with the community, and the councillors to take a
final decision on this matter.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Frankie Daly

| will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick supports the
Caherdavin Residents Association's request to keep the Caherdavin Library open
for a 6 month trial. Over that 6 months the library can be housed on the ground floor
of the community centre, to avoid breaching health and safety concerns as
expressed by library services. This trial period can give space for the library to
develop a clear and important role within the Limerick Library Services, or at least
develop with the community proposals for alternative services. At the end of this trial
period, a review should take place with the community, and the councillors to take a
final decision on this matter.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Jerry O’Dea

| will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District that Limerick City and
County Council address the need for enhanced traffic calming measures at Roxboro
and Donoughmore National Schools.

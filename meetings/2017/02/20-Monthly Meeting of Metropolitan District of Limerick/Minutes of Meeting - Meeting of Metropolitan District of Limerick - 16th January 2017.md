QUESTIONS

3. ion mi mhir. Séighin O Ceallaigh

! will ask at the next Meeting what was the total cost of horse control in the Metropolitan
District for the entire year of 2016.

REPLY: The sum provided by the Council for horse control in 2016 amounted to:
€550,000. The outturns of expenditure for 2016 have not yet been finalised. The--
number of horses seized in 2016 was lower than in 2015 and it is likely that there
will be some savings. The budget provision for 2017 has been reduced accordingly
to €472,000.

Approximately 80% of horses seized by the Council occur in the Metropolitan
area. It is important to note that this is a demand led service where the Council
responds to representations from Members, the public and the Gardai to the
incidences of straying horses. As a result of this, it is difficult to accurately
forecast the likely demands for this service. It should also be noted that the
Council and the Members will explore possibilities in 2017 that could mitigate the
number of stray horses and the costs associated with same.

4. Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

1 will ask at the next Meeting how many houses in Limerick’s Metropolitan District have
NAMA offered to the Council, and of those how many did the Council accept?

REPLY: | wish to advise that in total nineteen properties have been offered to Limerick
City and County Council by NAMA in coordination with The Housing Agency.
Sixteen of those units were confirmed for housing need, to date four of the
properties have been purchased.

5. Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

! will ask at the next Meeting, following the consultants report on the air quality, health and
climate change implications of Irish Cements plans to burn tyres and other waste in Mungret,
is the Council now submitting an objection to the EPA, and will a copy of the consultants
report, and the submission to the EPA, be circulated to Councillors?

REPLY: It is the intention of the Physical Development Directorate to make a submission

NOTICES OF MOTION

6. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh

1 will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District calls on the Chief Fire Officer to
continue to monitor the overcrowding levels at University Hospital Limerick to ensure ongoing

compliance with the fire safety certificate.

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by Councillor Gilligan.

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh raised ongoing concerns at overcrowding at the
emergency department of University Hospital Limerick (UHL) and sought clarity regarding any
maximum patient capacity that might apply there, whether a fire certificate applied to the
emergency department and what role the Fire Department played in monitoring the facility.

Members supported the motion and raised concerns as to whether there would be sufficient
staff to evacuate the emergency department at short notice, should that be necessary.

REPLY: Limerick City & County Council Fire Authority operates under the Fire Services Act
1981 & 2003.

Section 18(2) of the Act places a duty on every person having control over
premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on
such premises and to ensure as far as reasonably practicable the safety of
persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.

Since October 2016, the Fire Authority has been engaging with the Chief
Executive Officer and the Management Team of University Hospital Limerick
regarding the emergency Department section of University Hospital Limerick. In
this regard, arrangements have been put in place regarding communication with
key personnel, regular meetings between the Fire Authority and the
Management Team of University Hospital Limerick to review measures in place,
trigger actions for periods of high activity, etc.

The Fire Authority has acknowledged the efforts made by University Hospital
Limerick to date regarding overcrowding in the Emergency Department.

The Fire Authority will continue to monitor this matter in 2017.
The Chief Fire Officer informed Members that, as the emergency department at UHL was built

prior to 1990, legislation relating to fire certificates did not apply, however, it was covered
under the Fire Services Act, 1981. He noted that hospital management had agreed that the

maximum combination of beds and trolleys in the A&E should be 44 and where this number was
approached, patients would be moved out of A&E and extra staff put in place. In relation to the
evacuation of the A&E he pointed out that there was a high degree of compartmentalisation in
the hospital and any evacuation would involve moving patients to another part of the hospital
and there was trained staff in place in this regard, at all times.

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhir. Séighin O Ceallaigh

1 will call at the next Meeting for a full review to be carried out on the Christmas period in
Limerick, to include traffic, parking, footfall, lights and overall experience. To include input
from Members of Limerick City and County Council's Traffic Department and local business
owners. —

The motion was proposed by Cmhir. 0 Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor O’Dea.

In proposing the motion Cmhir. O Ceallaigh highlighted the effect Christmas parking
arrangements can have on footfall and business in the city and the importance of reviewing this
and related Christmas issues.

In seconding the motion Councillor O’Dea noted that he had received considerable positive
feedback in relation to the “Free from 3” parking initiative and pointed out that, where free
parking was provided between 9.30am and 11.30am, many of the spaces were taken up by
people working in the town.

Members supported the motion and made the following points while discussing same :

¢ Free parking should not be provided as there was plenty of cheap on and off street parking
available.

e Free parking should be provided up to 11.30am to attract those dropping their children off
at school.

¢ The evening Christmas Market should be more extensively marketed and the evening
entertainment on offer should be reviewed.

Consideration should be given to making spaces at Arthurs Quay car park available .

The number of street spaces was being reduced by public realm works and alternatives such
as Park and Ride should be looked at. The public will respond to a good Christmas offering
and the Waterford Christmas Festival should be considered in this regard.

As up to 60% of parking is privately owned any review should include this sector.

Any decisions in relation to free parking should be done in full knowledge of the income lost
to the Council balanced against the potential benefits.

e The use of cheaper off street parking should be encouraged, bus routes should be reviewed
and the use of buses encouraged with a view to promoting Limerick as a city with low traffic
congestion.

e Smarter Travel should be involved in any transport and parking discussions.

The Director thanked Members for their input and undertook to carry out the requested review
in the coming months. He noted that the turning on of the Christmas lights had been a positive
event but that many businesses had been closed at the time and had missed an opportunity for
more business. He pointed out that traffic and parking would be reviewed and stressed the
importance of regulating parking to ensure a turnover of spaces. He noted that the “Free from

3” parking initiative had lead to issues and that the morning might be more appropriate in this
regard.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Costelloe

1 will move at the next Meeting that this Council review the arrangements for carrying out
works on Council houses, in light of the recent data that it is taking an average of 2 months to

turn over a Council property.

The Mayor informed Members that this motion would be sent to the Home and Social
Development Strategic Policy Committee for consideration.

10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick’s Metropolitan District, in light of the evictions
faced by numerous Sova Properties tenants in the Strand Apartment complex and elsewhere
in the city, write to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and
the TDs covering the Metropolitan District urging them to amend the Residential Tenancies

Act 2004 to abolish sale of a property as a ground for terminating a tenancy.

The Mayor informed Members that this motion would be sent to the Home and Social

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick’s Metropolitan District write to the Irish Nurses
and Midwives Organisation in support of the recent vote of nurses in UHL and St. John’s
Hospital for strike action.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted the shortage of nurses in UHL and St. Johns

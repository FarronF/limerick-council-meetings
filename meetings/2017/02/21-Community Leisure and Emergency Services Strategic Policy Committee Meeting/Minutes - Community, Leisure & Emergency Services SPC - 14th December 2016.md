Cllr. M. Collins.

**Item 2:**

**Matters arising**

Minutes to be amended under item 4 to reflect that it was E O’ Donovan who asked how

members can get involved on the Suicide Sub Group.

It was agreed to take items 4 to 6 first to facilitate the non members Cllr S. O’Ceallaigh and

Cllr. J Leddin who had submitted Notices of Motion.

**Item 4:**

**Consideration of Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. J. Leddin**

**“*I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City & County Council, in***

***concern for the urgent situation of undocumented migrants living and***

***working in Limerick, endorse the introduction of a regularisation scheme***

***for undocumented migrants in Ireland”.***
---
Cllr. Leddin acknowledged the work of NGO’s in Limerick especially Doras Luimní who do

great work with migrants and the undocumented in Limerick. He asked the members of this

SPC to consider his motion as over 30,000 people have come to Ireland to work and live.

Some have major issues and can’t claim state benefits. He felt that a scheme where there is

specific criteria would benefit them and they would then be documented. All councils are

encouraged to pass this motion which would then go to the government for their

endorsement.

Majority of councillors supported this motion and felt it was a positive step. Chairperson

read out a note from M. Healy, questioning the legitimacy of such a motion at this SPC. All

the members complimented Doras Luimní on their work. Cllr. K. Sheehan suggested that the

SPC write to all the members of the Dail and Seanad expressing their support for the

introduction of the scheme. **Chairperson will check the standing orders to see if this can**

**be done**.

**Item 5:**

**Consideration of Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. J. Leddin**

***“I will move at the next Meeting that Council conduct a feasibility study into***

***the building of a municipal swimming pool in the Raheen Dooradoyle area***

***to accommodate the growing need for additional community and***

***recreational facilities in this part of the*** ***city”.***

Cllr. Leddin queried the possibility of a feasibility study into building a municipal swimming

pool. He has seen a significant growth in the last few years in this area and a lot of work has

been done in the greater Mungret area. He is aware that the Council have taken over lands in

Ballykeefe and suggested it as a possible site.

A/Director of Service said there is a need for an overall Recreational Plan and that the review

of the new development plan, due to commence next year might be timely for this SPC to

discuss recreational facilities. The recreational facilities in Grove Island, Bawnmore and

Askeaton are already well supported by the council.

Several members stressed the need for the local community to be actively involved and asked

for more details on the groups behind this proposal.



**Chair asked that a presentation from the local community be made at a**

**future SPC and it was agreed to defer this motion until then.**

**Item 6:**

**Consideration of Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin**

**Ó’Ceallaigh**

***“I will move at the next Meeting that the Council plan to increase the level***

***of outdoor public gym facilities across the Metropolitan area over the next***

***year”.***
---
Cllr. O’ Ceallaigh advised the meeting that this is an initiative that he would like the Council

to consider in 2017. He asked that the Council be more encouraging of people leading

healthier lifestyles and becoming more active.

Motion was generally supported. A/Director of Service said there is a need to look at the

overall outdoor public gym facilities in Limerick. There are outdoor facilities at present in

Baggot Estate, Mungret, Canal Bank, Shannon Fields and Castletroy.

 **Motion was passed by members.**

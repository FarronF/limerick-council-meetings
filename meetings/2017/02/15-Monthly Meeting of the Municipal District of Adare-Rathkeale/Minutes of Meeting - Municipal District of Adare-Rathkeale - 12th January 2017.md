NOTICES OF MOTION

6. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that a footpath linking Askeaton to the Wyeth Plant be provided
as many locals walk to and from Askeaton to the plant.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Keary.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Sheahan highlighted the potential danger posed to pedestrians
walking along this stretch of road, particularly at night, and noted that the issue had been brought
to his attention by motorists who had narrowly avoided colliding with pedestrians at this location.
He noted that there was plenty of room in the grass margin to accommodate the works necessary
to create a safe lane for pedestrians and cyclists and called for the Council to identify the funding
needed to carry out these works.

Members noted the potential of the planning application system to make provision for extra traffic
and safety requirements generated by school expansions and to deal with water runoff from
private houses on to public roads. Members welcomed the proposed development at Wyeth and
noted that a planning application was pending in relation to same.

REPLY: It is estimated that the provision of a footpath and associated works would cost in
the region of €65,000 due to necessary land acquisition and other associated works.
The financing of such a project is beyond the scope of the Municipal District Works
Programme. A feasibility study and preliminary design can be carried out at an
approximate costing of €3,000.00. Funding for same should be considered under
GMA or Development Fund works.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer clarified that land acquisition would be necessary on the
Askeaton Town side of the N69.

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

| will move at the next Meeting that this District invites Inspector Alan Cullen to our February
Meeting to discuss and review the policing that was in place during the December period of
2016. | will also be asking to know what measures are being put in place for the St. Patrick’s day
festivities that are taking place on Friday the 17” of March. | also would like a member of the
local authority with direct responsibility for littering and policing of same to be also in
attendance at that Meeting.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey highlighted a range of incidents in Rathkeale during
December 2016 with a large amount of littering and non use of litter bins, assault, theft, speeding,
the blocking of streets and a general disrespect being shown by visitors for the people of the town.
Councillor Teskey noted that the District had requested that extra outside Garda resources be
allocated to Rathkeale but it appeared that instead, extra hours had been allocated to existing

staff.

Councillor Keary stressed the need to reduce the number of entrances to Rathkeale and to close
the unauthorised caravan parks that come into use, with no associated public amenities.
Councillor Keary proposed an amendment to the Motion and called for a Special Meeting to be
held to address this issue from a multi agency viewpoint with the Garda Chief Superintendent and
local Inspector, the Council’s Chief Executive, the Health Service Executive (HSE), Department of
Social Protection, Department of Children, the Community Council, local Oireachtas Members and
the Catholic Church invited to attend. Members indicated support for the original Motion and the
amendment and following discussion it was agreed that representatives of all religious
denominations located in Rathkeale be invited, along with MEP’s and Mr. David Breen
representing Social Cohesion.

Members made the following points while discussing this Motion;

¢ If the influx of visitors were prohibited from using the unauthorised sites, where would
they locate.

¢ The high number of weddings held in Rathkeale over the Christmas period contributes to
the high number of visitors.

¢ Rathkeale does not benefit commercially during this period as locals cannot access the
town and the majority of visitors support businesses elsewhere.

¢ More Garda resources were needed in Rathkeale during this period and this has proved
successful when high numbers of visitors attend at events such as festivals at Tralee and
Killorglan.

e A litter warden should be allocated to work full time in Rathkeale during the Christmas
period.

e CCTV should be installed in Rathkeale as an aide to the Gardai. It was noted that the
Council had applied for funding for a county wide initiative in this regard.

¢ The licencing laws were not being adhered to and steps should be taken to control the
large number of unsupervised children on the streets in the late evening and night.

Councillor Keary raised issues in relation to the unauthorised use of a property in Rathkeale for the
sale of beds which had been reported to the Enforcement Section but no apparent action had

been taken.

Councillor Keary noted a high level of dumping at the bottle bank in Rathkeale and requested that
the CCTV footage monitoring this location be monitored and offenders pursued. He requested a
report on same for the next District Meeting. The A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that this
CCTV footage was already being reviewed and undertook to provide the report as requested.

Councillor O'Donoghue noted that snap on cameras were being used at bring banks in conjunction
with street lights to monitor unauthorised dumping but pointed out that there was an issue
placing these cameras on some lights. He requested that these lights be identified. The A/Senior
Executive Engineer undertook to investigate this issue.

8. Correspondence
Correspondence was noted.
The following issues were raised by Members with the permission of the Cathaoirleach.

Members raised the issue of the incomplete path from Kildimo Village to the Beer Garden and
noted the update that had been circulated in relation to same. Members suggested that a further
period of up to three months be allowed to continue negotiations with the owner of the land
needed to complete the path and that a CPO procedure be considered thereafter. Members also
raised the need for kerbing to protect path users from vehicles driving onto the grass margin and
requested an update report on these issues for the next Meeting.

Councillor Sheahan proposed that the District write to the Minister for Health to express the
District’s deep concern at the conditions being experienced by patients and staff arising from
overcrowding at the emergency department of University Hospital Limerick and to stress the need
to open up beds at the hospital and provide staff in conjunction with same. Members suggested
that student nurses be availed of to supplement existing nursing resources and that student
nurses should spend more time in a hospital setting, as part of their training. The Motion was
seconded by Councillor Teskey and agreed by Members.

This concluded the Meeting.

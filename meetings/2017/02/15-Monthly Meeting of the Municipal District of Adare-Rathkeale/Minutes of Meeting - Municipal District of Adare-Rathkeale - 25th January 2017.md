2. Christmas Arrangements Rathkeale Town 2017

Members highlighted the issues arising in Rathkeale each Christmas associated with a large influx
of visitors with resulting parking of caravans on unauthorised sites and an insufficient Garda
presence to deal with any breaches of the law that might occur. Members discussed the large
number of children and youths on the streets unsupervised and also a number of unfinished
developments that need to be addressed.

Members highlighted the potential benefits of installing smart cameras in Rathkeale as an aide to
the Gardai and the importance of ensuring that sufficient cameras are installed there as part of a
county wide initiative that is underway in this regard.

Following discussion it was agreed that facilitators should be engaged by the Council to engage
with the District Members and interested parties in the community to agree and document the
issues to be addressed. It was also agreed that a Special Meeting ‘in Committee’ would be held
with the Chief Superintendent of the Gardai to discuss how best to deal with law and order issues
and that consideration would be given to the issue of a press release by the District Members,

subsequent to that Meeting.

This concluded the Meeting.

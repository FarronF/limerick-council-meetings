address:

**“Fellow Elected Representatives, Chief Executive, Minister, Oireachtas**

**Members, Council Officials, Ladies and Gentlemen. The Office and role of**

**Mayor is an historic one that stretches back throughout the centuries. I have**

**been honoured to serve the people of Limerick in this prestigious office. Being**

**Mayor of the City and County of Limerick has been a privilege.**

**I would like to thank my family, especially my wife Mary, and my children**

**Catriona, Therese, Adrian, Gareth and Ciaran, who have supported me**

**throughout the year.**

**To my fellow Councillors, thank you! You have made my time as Mayor an easy**

**one. Yes, we have had our differences of opinion, but you have always stood**

**firm behind the Office of Mayor.**

**I would like to mention, in particular, Councillor Noel Gleeson, who, as Deputy**

**Mayor of the City and County of Limerick, was a great support to me during the**

**past year and was always there to help.**

**To the Management and Staff of Limerick City and County Council – including**

**in particular the staff of Corporate Services and Facilities, a sincere ‘thank you’**

**for all your help, advice and guidance over the past 12 months.**

**I leave the office of Mayor with some wonderful memories. One of my abiding**

**memories will be the reaction I received from pupils in primary schools when I**

**visited their school. The look of wonder and awe in their faces when I walked**

**into the school with the robes and chain was heart-warming. That and, I**

**suppose, the fact the pupils were allowed to go without homework that**

**evening!**

**Limerick is truly on an upward curve. We have seen that in the jobs**

**announcements we’ve had, the latest being Northern Trust just a few weeks**

**ago. There is a renewed confidence that we are going in the right direction.**

**Limerick Twenty-Thirty, which I had the privilege of launching in September, is**

**making great strides. Construction work is happening at the Gardens**

**International Site, plans are being finalised for the Opera Site, and work is**

**ongoing in the Cleeves Development.**

**The Limerick Northern Distributor Road is another important piece of the**

**jigsaw, which has been put on a firm footing in the past few weeks.**

**Limerick has become a much more outward looking region. We are a vibrant**

**County with much to offer. I was privileged to have led a number of overseas**

**delegations to tell the successful story of Limerick and to sell Limerick to the**

**world. These trips are necessary to make sure that the best possible story of**

**Limerick is getting to the people who make the decisions.**

**One particular trip to China eventually resulted in Limerick being awarded a**

**UNESCO Learning City Award, highlighting the excellent work being carried**

**out here in lifelong learning.**

**The 1916 Commemorations which took place across Limerick highlighted the**

**pride we have in our history and also allowed us to take a look at what it means**

**to be Irish.**

**The Limerick 2020 Bid also proved that Culture and the Arts are still a very**

**important and growing force in Limerick. This has been galvanised by the**

**Working Group to see how best to develop our undoubted potential.**

**Travelling to all the different events and being at awards and prize-giving**

**ceremonies demonstrated to me the pride people take in their communities,**

**the spirit that is present across Limerick. We might not all be related, but we**

**have a common bond and that is Limerick.**

**When I was elected Mayor, one of my objectives was to be progressive and**

**innovative in the way the Council works. A lot of work on this has been**

**achieved and we need to continue to innovate in order to provide the best**

**possible services we can for all the citizens of Limerick.**

**Limerick is a vibrant place, with countless individuals and local groups with**

**bright ideas and positive attitudes to making things happen. I hope that I have**

**helped in some small way to help progress plans and ideas.**

**And one bit of advice to the new Mayor - get sleep when you can and enjoy**

**your time. It is a unique privilege, given to a select few. Thank you. Go raibh**

**mile maith agaibh go léir.”**

Sheehy. **(8)**

For Councillor Keller

Councillors Keller, Prendiville. **(2)**

There were no abstentions.

The outgoing Mayor declared Councillor Keary elected as Mayor of the City and County of

Limerick and congratulated him on his election.

The incoming Mayor, Councillor Keary, gave the following address to the Meeting:

**Councillors, Minister, Oireachtas Members, Chief Executive, Staff of Limerick**

**City and County Council, Friends and Supporters. I would like to start by**

**congratulating Councillor O’Hanlon and Councillor Gleeson on an exceptional**

**year as Mayor and Deputy Mayor. I would like to commend them on a job well**

**done and for flying the flag for Limerick continuously over the past 365 days.**

**The way I view this role is much like the Limerick or Munster jersey - you only**

**borrow it while you are wearing it so I hope to pass it on next year to another**

**member of the panel in the same condition that Kieran has handed it to me,**

**with added stripes and, hopefully, not too many blood stains!!**

**I would like to say a sincere word of thanks to my Proposer and Fine Gael**

**Group Leader, Councillor John Sheahan, and to my Seconder and colleague in**

**the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, Councillor Adam Teskey, and to my**

**Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil colleagues, and all of my colleagues for your**

**support.**

**On 18th** **June, 1975, I boarded the CIE bus at Galway Station for what I thought**

**was a three-month contract as a site engineer in Moyross housing**

**development. 42 years later, a wife, 2 children and a lot of water under**

**Sarsfield Bridge, I am still here and incredibly proud to call Limerick my home.**

**Through good times and bad, as a construction worker, I was always able to**

**depend on this City for reasonably sustainable employment. This enterprising**

**City and County has allowed me to become self-employed, which I have been**

**for over 25 years now. I know the highways and byways of Limerick and so I**

**won’t be needing a sat-nav to navigate my way around it, having started my**

**career in the development of Moyross and from there I covered almost every**

**corner of the City and County.**

**Today, I would like to pay a special tribute to the people of the old Rathkeale**

**Electoral Area, and now the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, who have**

**put their trust in me and have elected me to this Council since 2009.**

**I would like to thank my Fine Gael Branch in Croagh and all of my supporters,**

**friends, neighbours and campaign team without whom I would not be in this**

**position.**

**I would like to give a special welcome to my brothers and their families who**

**have travelled from Galway to be here today, and to my in-laws from West**

**Limerick.**

**I would like to pay a very special word of thanks to Bridie, my wife of 37 years,**

**who keeps the show on the road and without whom I most certainly would not**

**be here today. And to my two daughters, their husbands and my three**

**grandsons who are on their best behaviour for the day that’s in it.**

**It is the ultimate privilege to be elected the First Citizen of Limerick, the fourth**

**Mayor of this amalgamated Authority. I am really looking forward to the year**

**ahead, during this unique period of Limerick’s transformation. Limerick is an**

**evolving City and County with many diverse characteristics and opportunities.**

**It is my ambition to harness the positives and be a representative of all sectors**

**of society.**

**I know some media reports in the last fortnight may have portrayed me in a**

**different light and, again, as I have said already, I sincerely apologise to those**

**people to whom my comments caused offence. I will be a Mayor for all the**

**people of Limerick.**

**Limerick is now a socio-economic and cultural hive of activity with expanding**

**educational institutions which are second to none and are constantly meeting**

**the demands of economic development.**

**I have a number of specific goals which I will work towards for my term as**

**Mayor.**

**I will be an ambassador for Limerick at home and abroad and encourage**

**continued investment and the creation of opportunities for our young people.**

**2017 and 2018 will be hugely important for the future of Ireland as Britain**

**prepares to exit the European Union and I believe we here in the Mid-West**

**Region need to speak with one voice. It is my intention to work with my**

**colleagues in Clare and Tipperary to establish a Regional Forum to work with**

**the State Agencies to look at the potential opportunities and challenges facing**

**the Mid-West Region as a result of Brexit.**

**I will play my part in continuing the economic rejuvenation of Limerick and to**

**work with all stakeholders in doing so. I am a firm believer that education and**

**up-skilling are the cornerstones of improving the fortunes of any community**

**and its people. It is almost fifty years since a Limerick man introduced free**

**education. This man, Donogh O’Malley, was a man ahead of his time and his**

**legacy to Ireland has been immeasurable.**

**Our elderly are the foundations on which we build communities. I will be using**

**my year as Mayor to raise the profile of our elderly, working with and listening**

**to active retirement groups and communities across Limerick, and I will use**

**my influence where possible to improve their services.**

**I have seen in other counties the success of specific branding to market**

**products and services. As we enter into uncertainty with Brexit, I want the**

**manufacturing, service providers and agri-food sectors to work with the Local**

**Authority to create a sustainable, indigenous sector and which can be used to**

**promote Limerick. We have proven our success with inward investment and**

**now we need to push for outward investment.**

**John Hume, probably the greatest Nationalist Leader of modern Ireland, whose**

**only political philosophy was the pursuit of peace in Ireland, once said: “I was**

**grateful for the opportunity to make a difference.”**

**I hope over the next twelve months to be able to make a difference to the future**

**of Limerick. I look forward to working with, and for, all Limerick people to help**

**build a better place for our future generations. Today is my late mother’s**

**seventh anniversary and I know she and my late father would be very proud to**

**see their son elected to the position of First Citizen of Limerick.**

**To all of my fellow Councillors who have given me this opportunity, may I**

**simply say: ‘Mile Buíochas - Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir.”**

**Mayor, and his Deputy, Councillor Vivienne Crowley, all the very best for the**

**There have been many highlights during the past 3 years but among the most**

**memorable for me have been ‘Limerick City of Culture 2014’ when I served on**

**the Board with a great team of people; serving on the Steering Committee for**

**the 2020 Bid - a wonderful opportunity for Limerick to showcase the wonderful**

**artistic nature of our City; the many new job announcements throughout the**

**City and County; advancements in our infrastructure - most noticeable in**

**Limerick East being the recent advancements with the Northern Distributor**

**Road. (I believe from local media that the Coonagh/Knocklisheen stage is due**

**to commence in August).**

**From a Tourism perspective, it is great to see that the Shannon Estuary Way is**

**now officially launched and residents of Glin, Foynes and all along the N69 are**

**now more responsive than ever to receive visitors to their many attractions**

**along the Way.**

**I attended the official opening of the JFK Centre in Bruff recently – it is in a**

**perfect location in the old Courthouse and I would highly recommend a visit to**

**those who haven’t yet been out there. Local Councillors have been very**

**instrumental in the establishment of the Centre and I applaud them for their**

**great input.**

**Just this past weekend we had several visiting choirs to the City - local**

**national and international - for the 5th** **‘Limerick Sings’ International Choral**

**Festival, and I enjoyed partaking with our local Community Choir, together with**

**my predecessor, former Councillor, Mary Jackman. Before I wrap up, I would**

**like to pay tribute to Mary who passed the baton to me and continues to be a**

**beacon of light in our community. A big ‘thank you’ to members of the**

**Castletroy Monaleen Branch of Fine Gael for all their support prior to my**

**election and over the past few years.**

**Finally, a huge thank you to my very supportive husband Brian, my son Aidan,**

**daughter Emma and her husband Ian, and their 3 children (Mollie, Charlie and**

**Emilie). I would like to welcome my big brother, Sean Scanlan, of ‘Club**

**Limerick,’ and his wife, Bernadette, together with my neighbours and friends**

**(many of whom I know for over 30 years), and thank you for your ongoing**

**support and for being here to-day.**

**Many thanks in particular to our Council Executives, Tina Knox, Liz Creamer**

**and Christy O’ Connor, for all the organisation around today’s event. Go raibh**

21st June, 2013, John F. Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline, returned to her ancestral home in

Mr. Dennehy stated that the Heritage Group was anxious to promote Bruff and the Thomas

Fitzgerald Centre as a tourism destination. He thanked all in attendance at this very special

event.

Councillor Kieran O’ Hanlon, Mayor of the City and County of Limerick, formally opened the

Meeting wishing everyone a very warm welcome. He said that the Council was delighted to

be in a position to host a Meeting of the Full Council in the Thomas Fitzgerald Centre in

Bruff. He referred to John F. Kennedy’s visit to Limerick in 1963 when he had been

presented with the Freedom of the City. President Kennedy had planned on returning to

Ireland the following Spring, but sadly this was not to be. The Mayor said that he was

making every effort to foster relationships with Boston. He referred to upcoming visit to

Boston and said that, as part of this visit, a new link would be added to the Mayoral Chain

commemorating the centenary of the birth of John F. Kennedy. The cost of the link was

being sponsored by the Shannon Group.

The Cathaoirleach and Members of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock, and

each of the Party Leaders, addressed the Meeting saying that they were honoured to attend

the Special Meeting on such an auspicious occasion. They thanked the Bruff Heritage Group

and acknowledged the Group’s dedication and commitment to the Centre and the

promotion of Tourism in the area.

The Mayor said he was delighted to be in a position to announce the winner of the

Fitzgerald Family Bible Bruff Award for 2017. The Award, he explained, was given to a

person who made a significant contribution to the Country of Ireland through a particular

act or particular service. He added that the Award was established in 2015 and promoted

the link between Bruff and the Fitzgerald Family Bible. Previous recipients of the Award

were Philomena Lee and Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh. He then proceeded to announce the

winner of the Award for 2017, Social Justice Campaigner, Sister Stanislaus Kennedy.

The Deputy Chief Executive, on behalf of the Council, thanked the Bruff Heritage Group and

community of Bruff for the very warm welcome. He stressed the importance of keeping the

linkage alive with the Kennedy Family as the Thomas Fitzgerald Centre was a unique visitor

attraction and one that would be looked at in terms of the overall tourism strategy. He

commended the spirit of volunteerism which was evident in the establishment and

development of the Centre. He concluded by wishing the Bruff Heritage Group the very best

for the future and said the Council was fully supportive and committed to the Centre.

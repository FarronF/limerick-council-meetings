**QUESTIONS**

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

***I will ask at the next meeting*** ***if the Council has any agenda in place to deal with or combat***

***any threat of terrorism in our City and if not, can they do so and keep Councillors appraised.***

Reply:

A Framework for Major Emergency Management (2006) enables An Garda

Síochána, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities (or Principal

Response Agencies) to prepare for and make a coordinated response to major

emergencies. An Garda Síochána is the lead agency in responding to a terrorist

type incident and is responsible for leading the coordination between the

Principal Response Agencies.

The other Principal Response Agencies (i.e. Local Authorities and the Health

Service Executive) ensure effective liaison is maintained with An Garda Síochána

at all times during an incident and to support the response as appropriate.

An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and Limerick City and County

Council are in on going regular contact.

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next meeting, given recent reports on concerning radon levels across the***

***country, what monitoring of this harmful gas is there in the District?***

Reply:

The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which recently merged with the

EPA, is the competent authority for monitoring ionising radiation levels in the

country.

The RPII has produced a map of Ireland which indicates areas which are likely to

be at risk from Radon (called high radon areas). The higher risk areas are shown

in

light

and

dark

brown.

This

interactive map

can

be

found

at: http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radonmap/

Limerick has relatively few areas which are considered to be at high risk.

However, it is possible to find individual residences with high radon in low risk

areas and vice versa.

The EPA/RPII provides a radon measuring service. Radon monitors will be sent to

a homeowner on request and these are placed in the main bedroom and living

area for three months. They are then returned to the EPA who will issue results to

the homeowner.

Further information is available at: http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radon/

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next meeting, as part of the Healthy Ireland initiative, has consideration been***
---
6

***given to requiring a Health Impact Assessment to be included in major planning applications***

***and Council plans for the District.***

Reply:

Healthy Ireland is a Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish

society where everyone can enjoy physical and mental health, and where

wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of society. Healthy Ireland has

come about because of concerns that the current health status of people living in

Ireland, including lifestyle trends and health inequalities, are leading us towards a

future that is dangerously unhealthy, and a very likely unaffordable society.

Healthy Ireland refers to health and wellbeing being assessed as part of social

impact assessments with tools and supports to be developed for local authorities

working with other sectors. Limerick City and County Council has employed a

Healthy Limerick Co-Ordinator, with the role of ensuring that there is a

collaborative cross organisational approach to health and well being, which

makes the best use of resources and actively addresses health issues.

While, the Limerick County Development Plan 2010 -2016 (As Extended), already

contains an objective which, requires a Sustainability Statement and Social

Infrastructure Assessment be carried out on residential developments of 5 or

more dwellings and commercial/industrial developments over 1,000m2. It is

proposed that all future plans, will consider objectives and policies on health and

well being. In line with the National Planning Framework – Ireland 2040, Issues

and Choices Paper, which was published in February 2017, for the first time

highlighted the issue of Health and Wellbeing. Health needs to be considered

from planning stage to implementation and beyond.

District in receipt of HAP, RAS, Local Authority or AHB accommodation.

***I will ask at the next meeting what the current situation is regarding the Council owned car***

Reply:

The Council has held a lease on Arthurs Quay Multi Storey Car Park for the past

26 years with an option to purchase the car park into infinity. The Council has

this regard.

***charge the Salmon Weir estate in Annacotty.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will move at the next meeting that the District request a presentation to be given to a future***

***meeting on the work of the Council in the Metropolitan District to inspect private rental***

***accommodation in the City and monitor standards.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

Reply:

Community Support Services is happy to facilitate the request for a presentation

on the work of the Private Rented Inspections Unit at a future meeting of the

Metropolitan District.

Councillor Crowley requested that the Presentation also focus on the increasing number of

rented properties which were not registered with the Private Rented Tenancy Board (PRTB).

Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh requested that houses owned by the Council be examined also to ensure

that they met the relevant standards.

It was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, seconded by Councillor Secas and unanimously agreed

that a representative from the Private Rented Tenancy Board (PRTB) be invited to give a

presentation also.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District condemns the recent***

***attacks on mosques in our city, re-affirms that Limerick is an intercultural city and that we***

***strive for full freedom of religion for all, regardless of their religion or lack of religion and***

***asserts that racism has no place in this city.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Lynch.

Members, in supporting the Motion, requested that the Council address effective integration of
---
9

migrants and refugees into our communities and give out the message that racism and hate had

no place in Limerick.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council review and amend the Limerick City Public***

***Park bye-laws to include the Baggot Estate Nature Park as a designated public park.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

Reply:

The Baggot Estate is comprised of approximately 20 acres and functions as a

nature park.

It must be noted that the Baggot Estate, as a 'nature park', represents a different

characterisation to that afforded to a municipal park. The nature park affords

habitats etc. to various species of animals and birds. The designation of Baggot

Estate as a public park could possibly lead to a change to the essential nature of

the Baggot Estate. This estate should not be seen in isolation from the other

parks, nature parks and open spaces.

There are other nature parks, reserves and open spaces in the metro area which

are not designated as public parks.

Public parks serve a different function with a much higher standard of

development and maintenance.

There are parks in the Metropolitan area such as the Peoples Park, Shelbourne

Park and O' Brien Park all of which are over 100 years old and are maintained to a

city park standard with extensive planting.

There are 2 suburban parks in Castletroy and Mungret which are primarily leisure

spaces without extensive planting and maintenance. Arthurs Quay Park and

Russell Park are also maintained.

Considerable capital investment would be required by the Council to bring the

Baggot Estate to the required standard.

It is likely that the following works would be required to bring Baggot Estate to

the required standard suitable for a public park.

These works would include the provision of public lighting, as well as a network of

footpaths, dustbins, benches etc. It is also likely that extensive tree growth would

have to be cut back and removed and extensive landscaping works carried out. As

stated previously there is a risk that undertaking such works would alter the

natural aspect and characteristic of the Baggot Estate.

The Baggot Estate would also require higher annual maintenance and the

presence of a park ranger with obvious cost implications.
---
10

Resources are not available for these works or the staffing issues that will arise.

Councillor Hogan requested that an overall cleanup of the Baggot Estate take place and that the

issue of anti social behaviour there be addressed.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council, in conjunction with TII, identify and put***

***measures in place to reduce the constant noise from the M7, affecting residents of Golf Links***

***Road, Thornfield and Cherryfield estates in Castletroy/Monaleen, whose properties back on to***

***M7.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Pond.

At the conclusion of the agenda, the Mayor asked that a minutes silence be observed for the

people of Manchester in memory of the victims of the terror attack and also in memory of the

late Fr. Jack Finucane, Freeman of Limerick.

This concluded the Meeting.

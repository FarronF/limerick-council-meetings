rather than large scale redevelopment.

consolidation and growth.

and stated that the Council would actively target property owners and developers to avail of
these schemes.

Members thanked him for his presentation and requested that vacant properties in towns and
villages in the District be looked at and the owners contacted. They also raised the issue of the
proposal to build a Social Housing Scheme on an available site at Mountcollins. It was stated
that unless the sewage system was upgraded this development and similar developments in
other towns and villages would not materialise. Contact should be made with Irish Water in

relation to the upgrading of sewage systems.

The Director, Service Operations stated that it was their intention to identify vacant properties
in towns and villages in order that these could be made available for Social Housing. He also
stated that the Council would take a very strict view of owners of derelict sites who did not
show a willingness to engage with schemes to renew or repair these properties. He also stated

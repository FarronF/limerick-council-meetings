13th April, 2017, of analysis carried out on behalf of the Council to assist in developing a

framework for festivals and events, which included the following :

 A summary of the projects supported by the Arts Office.

 Research methodology and a profile of festivals and events in Limerick in 2016.

 Where Limerick sits on the national context, Fáilte Ireland’s priorities for 2017 and the

key challenges faced by the Council in achieving its ambition to make Limerick a “must

visit” destination for both domestic and international visitors.

The Deputy Mayor took the chair at this point in the meeting as the Mayor had to attend a

function elsewhere.

The Director, Customer Services and Culture thanked Ms. Miller for her presentation and

pointed out that, through the Arts Office, there would now be a single point of contact

within the Council for those seeking to organise Festivals and Events. She noted the positive

benefits that had occurred from the recent workshops held with the public and with

Members of the Metropolitan District and recommended the following GMA allocations on

foot of same :-

 €30,000  St. Patrick’s Day Festival

 €30,000  Riverfest

 €50,000

Irish / New York Festival---

 €30,000

Richard Harris Film Festival (pending the submission of an approved business

plan).

Members discussed the issue of Festivals and Grants and made the following points in

relation to same :-

 The need to bring forward proposals of a suitable size and scale to attract significant

funding from Fáilte Ireland and the Arts Council.

 The need to consider extending funding available under Strand 2.

 The importance of Elected Members from the District being on any evaluation

committee that assesses projects for GMA support.

 The need to build on the Kate O’Brien literary festival, to investigate the potential for a

drama festival and to develop and promote events for the city and county, as twin

attractions.

 The need for local businesses that benefit from the increased footfall generated by

festivals and events, to contribute to same.

 The potential of a wine producers element to be held as part of a Wild Geese Festival.

 The need to organise events around the October Bank Holiday and New Year’s Eve.

 The need to explore the possibility of attracting European funding and the potential of

partnering with UK Authorities, post Brexit.

The Director, Customer Services and Culture acknowledged the issues raised by Members

and noted that the Council was building capacity and experience in this area. She noted the

Members request for a presentation in relation to the proposed Ireland / New York Festival

and pointed out the potential for the festival to go elsewhere, if the Council did not commit

to same.

The following proposal in relation to the GMA Festivals and Events Grant Scheme Guidelines

and Criteria and the related €238,000 GMA Allocation were proposed by Councillor Collins,

seconded by Councillor Leddin, and agreed :

 That the limits set out in Strand 1 be accepted and Strand 2 be amended to an upper

limit of €100,000, subject to District Members being on the Evaluation Committee that

would assess any projects to be funded by the District’s GMA.

 That €30,000 be allocated to St. Patrick’s Day Festival.

 That €30,000 be allocated to Riverfest.

submission of an approved business plan.

 That €50,000 be provisionally allocated to the Ireland / New York Festival, subject to

receipt of further details in relation to same.

A number of Members expressed the view that the allocation to the Ireland / New York

festival should be made if there was any danger that this festival would relocate.---

the background to, and procedures involved in, amending the Control of Horses Bye-Laws to

discussed the need to regulate the general use of sulkys on public roads, many of which

were driven by young children. Members also discussed the possibility of building a track to

accommodate sulky racing.

**QUESTIONS**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

**I will ask at the next Meeting what funding is currently allocated to the Council Mortgage**

**Allowance Scheme for the current year.**

**REPLY:**

We do not provide a budget for this, as the National Local Authority Mortgage

Allowance Scheme is claimed in full from the Department of the Environment

on a bi-annual basis.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

**I will ask at the next Meeting what is the current situation with regards the development**

**of the Horizon Mall.**

**REPLY:**

All previous planning permissions on the Horizon Mall site at the Parkway, Dublin

Road, Limerick have expired.

There are on-going discussions, since the Autumn 2016, with the promoters of

the site to consider the possible re-uses of the site in keeping with the Limerick

County Development Plan and the City Development Plan.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

**I will ask at the next Meeting when is it envisaged that the road upgrade on the Bloodmill**

**Road will be completed.**

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council have completed two Restoration

Improvement Schemes on Bloodmill Road during 2015 and 2016 costing

€300,000 approx. These schemes included road widening, surface water

drainage, road construction overlays and watermain upgrades over a length of

800m between the Garryglass roundabout and the old City/County boundary

at Carn Na Ree estate entrance.

There is a current multi annual roadworks programme 2016-2018 and I

confirm that within this programme Limerick City and County Council have no

plans to continue improvement works between Carn Na Ree estate and the

traffic lights at the junction with Childers Road. The completion of Bloodmill

road may be included from the 2019 roadworks programme.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

**I will ask at the next Meeting that the Council confirm to residents of Friarstown Park,**

**Ballyclough when the road in this estate is going to be resurfaced following the**

**representations made by them and on their behalf in the past years.**---
6

**REPLY**:

This estate has a road surface area of approximately 3,800 metres and is in

reasonable condition. Like most of the older estates in the Metropolitan area

it could do with a resurface and a ralumac surface would be recommended

here. The estimated cost of same is €35,000. The estate has not been

included in the 2017 Road Works Scheme but it is proposed to carry out some

heavy macadam patching around the estate entrance where potholing occurs

frequently. This work will commence shortly.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

**I will ask at the next Meeting that the Council confirm to residents of Grangewood, Rich**

**Hill and local houses on Newport Road when the footpath on this road from the Mackey**

**roundabout to the Rich Hill estate, which was due to be constructed in May 2016, will be**

**built to address the issue of road safety.**

**REPLY**:

At the April Local Area Briefing Meeting held on 4th April a sum of €30,000 was

approved in GMA Funding to provide a footpath link between Grangewood Estate

and the Mackey Roundabout. Previous requests to carry out this work were

declined due to lack of funding. The work includes 100 metres of footpath plus

surface water drainage, public lighting and associated civil works. These works

are due to take place during May 2017 with the public lighting in place and lit by

end of June 2017. Rich Hill Estate is a further 350 metres away and funding is not

available to extend the footpath to this estate. Note that Limerick City & County

Council will be surfacing Richill Estate in 2017 using Ralumac.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

**I will ask at the next Meeting that the Council confirm when speed ramps will be put in**

**place on Golf Links Road, Monaleen Road and Old School House Road following the**

**representations made in the past years on behalf of residents living in those areas.**

**REPLY**:

There is no specific budget provided for traffic calming and any new speed ramps

would have to be paid for out of general maintenance budgets. A 50 km/hr speed

limit applies in all cases and we have received no complaints from An Garda

Siochana about speeding issues on the three roads mentioned.

Golf Links Road:

In 2015 and 2016 Limerick City & County Council has undertaken works to

manage traffic speeds along a substantial length of Golf Links Road including:



a structural overlay between School House Road junction and Castletroy Golf

Club. There were 3 sets of speed cushions incorporated along this length to

enhance the safety for individual dwellings and through traffic along this

length.



Structural overlay at entrance to Mount Green Estate with an upgrade to the

existing table top ramp.---
7

School House Road:

There are four flat top ramps covering a 400 metre length of this road where

dwellings are concentrated and have individual accesses onto the road. The

remaining 420 metres of the road has only three entrances serving housing

estates. I am satisfied that there is no need for additional traffic calming

measures on this road.

Monaleen Road:

This road has two ramps at the southern end, another one at Monaleen Church

and a fourth at the approach to the R445 Dublin Road junction. There is also a

raised pedestrian crossing at Monaleen School and traffic lights at the junction

with School House Road and Monaleen Link Road. I am satisfied that there is no

need for additional traffic calming measures on this road.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the plans for outdoor film showing nights**

**over the summer, whether in the public parks or the Milk Market, as discussed last year.**

**REPLY**:

Outdoor cinema events were held successfully in the Peoples Park in 2014 as part

of the City of Culture. There are currently no plans for outdoor cinema events in

our public parks for the coming year but this can be kept under review subject to

funding and weather.

We cannot comment on film nights planned for the Milk Market as this comes

under the remit of The Limerick Market Trustees.

**12.**

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the situation regarding the increasingly**

**derelict Horizon Mall site, if it will be inspected for inclusion on the derelict sites register,**

**and if there are any plans for it to be developed as student accommodation, community**

**facilities, or a public space as previously suggested.**

**REPLY**:

All previous planning permissions on the Horizon Mall site at the Parkway, Dublin

Road, Limerick have expired.

There are on-going discussions, since the autumn 2016, with the promoters of

the site to consider the possible re-uses of the site in keeping with the Limerick

County Development Plan and the City Development Plan. It is not yet

appropriate at this stage to consider the potential inclusion of this site within the

derelict sites register.---

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be referred to the**

**Economic Development, Enterprise & Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting of Limerick's Metropolitan District that the Council look to**

**amend our development plan to ban the development of incineration, gasification,**

**fracking and other environmentally damaging and destructive industries in Limerick City &**

**County Council.**

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise &

Planning Strategic Policy Committee.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council commit to allocate funding towards the**

**restoration of the Black Bridge, a facility which has been used for recreational purposes by**

**people across the whole Metropolitan District.**

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted the extent of GMA funding that had been

allocated to carry out a study on the work needed to repair the Black Bridge, the amenity

value of the bridge in relation to walking, cycling and fishing and the need to reopen same.

He called on University of Limerick, Waterways Ireland, Clare County Council and Limerick

City and County Council to come together and arrange for the necessary works to be carried

out.

Members supported the motion and acknowledged the work of Smarter Travel in improving

the pathway from Limerick City to U.L. and highlighted the need to reopen the Black Bridge

to complement this work and provide additional walking route options and enhance the

tourism potential of the area.

**REPLY**:

The 2017-2019 Capital Programme as adopted by the Council in November 2016

provides for expenditure in the amount of €1.7m over the three years in respect

of essential bridge repairs, with a proposed spend of €700,000 in 2017.

The Capital Programme also provided for expenditure in the amount of €50,000

in respect of the footbridge at the Black Bridge. This €50,000 is required to fund

detailed studies etc.

The adopted Budget set out that this proposed expenditure would be funded

through grants.

The Council has received grant funding in respect of Bridge Rehabilitation Works

in the sum of €428,000 from DTTAS to fund works of repair in 2017 to 16 bridges

on Regional and Local roads throughout the County. The Bridge Rehabilitation

Works Scheme generally funds works to roads with bridges carrying vehicular---
9

traffic where significant funding is not required.

The Council has also received an allocation of €700,000 under the 2017 Specific

Improvement Grant for Thomond Bridge.

However, the estimated costs of restoration works to the Black Bridge at Plassey

have been estimated at €1m.

The Council will engage with DTTAS to establish if funding could be sourced under

the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme.

The Council will also seek to ascertain if other relevant statutory or non statutory

bodies may be in a position to contribute financially to the restoration of the

Black Bridge.

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh expressed dissatisfaction with the reply and noted that the Council would

not be in a position to approach others for funding if it could not make a commitment itself

in this regard.

The Meetings Administrator undertook to convey the sentiments expressed by Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh to the appropriate parties.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh (to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council devise a strategy on the implementation**

**of ramps, across the Metropolitan District.**

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Council support Limerick City Community Radio in**

**the provision of permanent accommodation for the community radio which provides an**

**important public service to the population of the Metropolitan District.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor McCreesh and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh pointed out that Limerick City Community

Radio, which was run by volunteers and broadcast on weekends, was under threat of closing

if a suitable premises could not be found. He noted that, ideally, a city centre location with

adequate parking and wheelchair access was required.

In seconding the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh praised the broad range of high standard

programmes produced by Limerick City Community Radio, who operated on a limited

budget, and on a not for profit basis and in the process provided valuable training for those

planning a career in broadcasting.---
10

Members supported the motion and noted the potential of the Digital Hub, run by Innovate

Limerick, to meet the requirements of Limerick City Community Radio, in conjunction with

Wired FM with whom they share a broadcasting frequency and who might also be in need of

premises, and requested that the motion be brought to the attention of Innovate Limerick.

Members also noted that Limerick Community Radio were in need of financial support and

the Meetings Administrator undertook to bring the matter to the attention of both Innovate

Limerick and the Home and Social Development Directorate.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be referred to the Home**

**and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this District write to the Minister for Housing**

**expressing, in the strongest possible terms, its objection to the exclusion of Limerick City**

**from the Government's rent pressure zones and calling for rent controls to be introduced**

**in the city.**

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Home and Social Development Strategic

Policy Committee.

**18.**

Correspondence was noted.

This concluded the Meeting.

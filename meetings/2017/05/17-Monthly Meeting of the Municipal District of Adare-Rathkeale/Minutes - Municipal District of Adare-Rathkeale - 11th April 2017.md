**Laws 2017 in Order to Regulate Sulky Racing on Public Roads in Limerick.**

Circulated, report of the Director, Physical Development dated 31st March, 2017 setting out

the background to, and procedures involved in, amending the Control of Horses Bye-Laws to

regulate sulky racing on public roads.

Members welcomed the proposed amendments to the Bye-Laws and made the following

points while discussing this item;

• The term sulky should clearly defined;

• Any sulkys using public roads should be registered and have reflectors at the rear.

Registration would establish ownership should the sulky be involved in a road traffic

accident;

• It should be clarified as to whether the Gardaí or the Council would seize horses on foot

of the amended Bye-Laws;

• Consideration should be given to establishing a track for sulky racing;

• Consideration should be given to regulating any use of sulkys on public roads.

The Director, Regional Services noted that the registration of sulkys would be a national issue

and not proper to Bye-Laws.

The Senior Executive Officer, Physical Development undertook to take the issues raised by

Members into consideration, going forward, and stressed the need to proceed with the

current amendment that had been requested by the Gardaí.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan;

Seconded by Councillor O’Brien;

And Resolved:

“That the Draft Limerick City and County Council (Control of Horses) Bye-Laws 2017 be put on

public display in accordance with Section 199 and Schedule 14A Part 1 of the Local

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**8.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this District would have an opportunity to have a**

**discussion with senior members of the Housing Section of the Council with a view to**

**ascertaining detailed information on the involvement of Approved Housing Bodies working**

**in the District.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Sheahan acknowledged the work carried out by Approved

Housing Bodies (AHBs) but stressed the need for these Bodies to engage with local public

representatives in relation to allocations, as issues in relation to same were being brought to

the Elected Members for resolution.

In seconding the Motion Councillor O’Brien expressed his desire that he be informed of

allocations by AHBs and be in a position to make representations in relation to same.

Members supported the Motion and sought clarity on arrangements in place between the

Council and AHBs and discussed the rents set by AHBs, their purchasing practices and their

overheads in managing single houses in large estates. Members acknowledged the success of

some AHBs in building and managing schemes of houses but raised concerns that some AHBs

were purchasing single dwellings in locations where there was no perceived local demand for

social housing.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors K. O’Hanlon (Mayor),

M. Collins, M. McCreesh, C. Prendiville, E. Secas, J. Sheahan,

B. Teefy

***We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the***

***Minister for Education to include the victims of the sexual and physical abuse suffered in***

***Creagh Lane Primary School in the redress scheme. The victims in question have fought***

***long and hard and their lives have been undermined and, in some cases, destroyed as a***

***result of what they suffered as innocent children in the care of the State. We are calling on***

***the Minister to remove all barriers to gaining access to the redress scheme for the Creagh***

***Lane victims.***

The Mayor and Members welcomed to the Meeting former students of the Creagh

Lane Primary School and representatives of the victims’ groups who were seated in the

Public Gallery.

In proposing the Motion, the Mayor said he had met with former students of the

school and he was of the opinion that they had a very moral and just case. He referred to

the horrific treatment which had been experienced by some who had attended the Creagh

Lane School. In particular, he highlighted how innocent children in the care of the state had

been let down and treated in a despicable manner.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe who added his full support to the

Motion. He commended the former students for their courage in coming forward. He said

the school should have been a place of hope, learning and sanctuary but that this had not

been the case for some who had attended there.

A large number of Members spoke in support of the Motion and said it was not good

enough for the Government to hide behind technicalities to try and exclude the victims of

Creagh Lane Primary School from the redress scheme.

In conclusion, the Members pledged their unanimous support for the Motion and

called on the Minister for Education to include the victims in the redress scheme. In

addition, they requested the removal of all barriers to gaining access to the redress scheme

for the Creagh Lane victims.

Reference was also made to the former Industrial School at Glin and Members

stressed the importance of preserving the records that had been retained in relation to Glin

to facilitate any future investigation.---

24A. Notice of Motion submitted by Mayor K. O’Hanlon

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council note the campaign**

**of the National Union of Journalists’ Local News Matters Week. The campaign is aimed at**

**highlighting the importance of properly resourced independent media to the functioning**

**of democracy at local and regional levels. Limerick City and County Council recognises the**

**importance of local media in reporting on local government and informing citizens about**

**the work undertaken on their behalf by elected representatives and local authorities and**

**agencies. Local media also reflect the concerns of citizens and provide a platform for civic**

**participation in dialogue on all aspects of community life. Journalists engaged by media**

**organisations: print, broadcasting and online, face many challenges, including increased**

**workloads, reduced resources, and lower staffing levels. This Council urges media**

**organisations to provide journalists with the level of resources necessary to ensure**

**accurate and comprehensive coverage of local democracy. This Council reaffirms its**

**commitment to make information available to the local media and to providing**

**appropriate facilities for journalists attending Council meetings.**

In proposing the Motion, the Mayor highlighted the importance of a properly

resourced independent media to the functioning of democracy at local and regional levels.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J) who highlighted the importance

of a strong local media. He indicated that local media was crucial in informing citizens about

work undertaken by the Local Authority, Elected Members and Agencies.

There was unanimous support for the Motion.

ADJOURNED NOTICE OF MOTION

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council calls on the**

**Government to notify the Council of Europe’s Convention Against Trafficking in Human**

**Organs.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Gilligan asked that the wording of the Motion be

amended from ‘to notify’ to ‘to ratify’ and this was agreed. The amended Motion was

seconded by Councillor O’Brien and agreed.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt

with:

10.

Question submitted by Councillor V. Crowley

**I will ask at the next Meeting has the Council any long-term plans for the maintenance**

**and/or improvement of the Limerick Westfield Wetlands and Bird Sanctuary, which are in**

**a Special Area of Conservation.**---
14

**REPLY:**

The 2017 Budget, as adopted, allows for some minor works of repair and

maintenance at Westfields. The Council carried out some maintenance

works to the path through Westfields recently as it was prone to flooding and

needed to be re-graded so that water would run off. The Council also placed

tar and chip on the surface.

The Council has received representations in relation to installing a tarmac

surface with a kerb. The Council does not have the resources available to

undertake works such as this and any proposal to undertake such works

would have to be considered as part of the 2018 budget process.

The Council does not have any long-term plans at the present time for the

Westfields area as it would be necessary to provide significant capital funding

to substantially upgrade the Westfields Sanctuary.

It should also be noted, however, that the 2017 Draft General Municipal

Allocation (GMA) Scheme for the Metropolitan District of Limerick includes a

proposal to carry out improvements to the footpaths in this wetlands area.

These proposals are still in draft format as the GMA Scheme has not yet been

approved by the Members.

11.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many litter fines have been issued in each of the**

**Municipal Districts over the past year.**

**REPLY:**

The Council issued a total of 500 litter fines in 2016. It is not possible to

provide exact details of litter fines issued per District. The following sets out

the approximate number of litter fines issued per District:

350 fines approx. were issued in the Metropolitan District of Limerick.

15 fines approx. were issued in the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale.

55 fines approx. were issued in the Municipal District of Cappamore-

Kilmallock.

80 fines approx. were issued in the Municipal District of Newcastle West.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

**I will ask at the next Meeting approximately how many units of accommodation are**

**currently vacant in the old Georgian Limerick Quarter, and are there any plans for the**

**State to step in to renovate them as affordable and social housing for people to rent or**

**buy.**

**REPLY:**

The Newtown Pery Historic Georgian area of the City is comprised of the five

electoral divisions of Custom House, Shannon A, Shannon B, Dock A and Dock

B. According to the 2016 Central Statistics Office Census figures, the average

vacancy rate across these 5 electoral divisions is 18.56%. Within these areas---
15

there exists a housing stock of 3,464 units and, according to the Census, a

population of 5,991 persons is contained. This represents a population

increase of 12.27% from 2011 to 2016. Please refer to Figure 1.

*Figure 1: Electoral Divisions of Limerick city centre (Newtown Pery Historic Georgian area),*

*Census, 2016*

Two major initiatives to tackle vacancy were recently launched by The

Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government under

the Rebuilding Ireland – Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. These

are (1) Repair and Leasing Initiative and (2) Buy and Renew Scheme. The first

initiative is targeted at encouraging private owners to refurbish property and

lease to the local authority, while the second scheme involves a local

authority or Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquiring and refurbishing

property for social housing. Limerick City and County Council welcomes both

of these initiatives and the potential positive impact of unlocking vacant

properties. Further details on these schemes are available on the

Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government

website.

In October 2016, Limerick City and County Council also submitted an

application currently under consideration to ‘Rebuilding Ireland’ entitled

‘Living Georgian Limerick Revitalisation Demonstration Blocks Project’ which

focuses on targeted actions and measures to renew existing vacant housing

in Limerick city centre. A decision is awaited on this ‘Pathfinder’s Proposal’

for innovative projects which fall under Pillar 5 of the Rebuilding Ireland

Programme to ‘Utilise existing housing.’ It builds on the Living City Initiative

(LCI) tax incentive to proactively demonstrate diverse development models

for the re-inhabitation of the historic core of the city. This tax initiative

incentivises the redevelopment and refurbishment of residential, rented

residential and commercial properties built prior to 1915, within the LCI

designated areas.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

**I will ask at the next Meeting will ultrafine particles, dioxins and Volatile Organic**

**Compounds (VOCs) be monitored at the proposed air quality monitoring stations in**

**Mungret and the City Centre.**

**REPLY:**

The Council has tendered for real time air monitors to monitor the following

parameters in ambient air: (i) PM10; (ii) PM2.5; (iii) NOx; (iv) SOx. In terms of

particulates, PM2.5 is considered to be the best available indicator in terms of

human health. Ultrafine particles are still under investigation and there are

no agreed limits for them in ambient air. However, the possibility of

measuring particulates down to PM1.0 will be explored and added to the

monitoring regime if possible.

Dioxin monitoring in Ireland is carried out by the Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) and is measured in milk fat as this is considered to be the best

indicator of human exposure. At the request of the Council, the EPA has

agreed to include an additional dioxin monitoring station in the vicinity of

Irish Cement.

VOCs will be monitored by the EPA at its proposed monitoring station in the

city centre.

Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller

**I will ask at the next Meeting what schemes are there in place to promote the**

**development of vacant ‘over the shop’ accommodation in Limerick.**

**REPLY:**

The Living City Initiative is a scheme of property tax incentives which applies

in certain 'special regeneration areas' in the centres of Dublin, Cork,

Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny. The scheme provides for tax

relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on both residential and certain

commercial refurbishment and conversion work that is carried out during

the qualifying period. The qualifying period for incurring qualifying

expenditure on owner/occupied residential property and commercial

property started on 5th May 2015 and ends on 4th May 2020. The equivalent

period for incurring expenditure on the refurbishment or conversion of

rented residential property starts on 1 January 2017 and ends on 4 May

2020.---
17

The owner-occupier residential element provides tax relief by way of a

deduction from total income of 10% per annum of qualifying expenditure

over a 10 year period and is only available where the property is the

claimant’s only or main residence.

Rented Residential and Commercial Relief is given in the form of an

accelerated capital allowance for qualifying expenditure on refurbishment

or conversion of rented residential and certain commercial premises within

the special regeneration areas. The capital allowance is given at the rate of

15% of qualifying expenditure for each of 6 years and 10% in year 7. In the

case of a commercial premises it must be used, after refurbishment /

conversion, for retail purposes or for the provision of services within the

State or the premises must be let on bona fide commercial terms for such

use. In the case of a rented residential premises, which must have been

originally built prior to 1915, it must be let on bona fide commercial terms,

after refurbishment /conversion, for use as a dwelling by the lessee. The

maximum level of actual tax relief which can be obtained in respect of any

individual project is capped at €200,000, in accordance with EU State aid

rules. The legislation is contained within Chapter 13 of Part 10 of the Taxes

Consolidation Act 1997.

A person can apply for both the commercial element of the scheme and also

the rented residential/owner occupier element.

The scheme was launched originally in May 2015 but it was not deemed

successful, Limerick did not have any applications. The Budget 2016 set out

the following revisions to enhance the scheme and generate increased

uptake:

**Changes to the Living City Initiative (LCI) as and from the 1st** **of January 2017**

• Extension of the residential element of the scheme to include landlords

• Removal of the requirement for a pre 1915 building to have been

originally constructed for use as a dwelling

• Floor restriction for owner occupiers has been removed

• In order to quality for residential relief a minimum amount of capital

expenditure under all elements of the scheme must exceed €5,000

An implementation team has been established by Limerick City and County

Council to manage the roll out of the ‘Living City initiative’. The team run

‘one stop shop’ clinics every fortnight at the Limerick City and County Council

Office in 7/8 Patricks Street. These clinics are by appointment and allow

citizens an opportunity to come and ask questions related to the scheme to a

cross departmental panel.---

NOTICES OF MOTION

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (to be

referred to Environment Strategic Policy Committee)

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council amend the**

**guidelines for the current waiver scheme so that those persons in receipt of invalidity**

**payments can also qualify, similar to those in receipt of disability allowance, for the**

**waiver.**

It was agreed to refer the Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors S. Keary, C.

McMahon, E. O’Brien, R. O’Donoghue, K. Sheahan, A. Teskey

**We will move at the next Meeting that Transport Infrastructure Ireland make direct**

**arrangements for the gathering and removal of litter along national roads in the**

**administrative area of the Council.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Brien, while acknowledging that funding was

limited, stressed the importance and vital need for a pronounced action plan with matching

funding to tackle the issue of littering on national primary routes. In addition, he said a clear

message should go out to those involved in littering/illegal dumping, it was not acceptable

and, if caught, the full rigours of the law would be used in bringing them before the courts.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Keary said he was calling on Transport

Infrastructure Ireland to take direct responsibility for the gathering and removal of litter

along national roads and, in particular, on the N21.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council actively promote**

**the use of the landbank at Askeaton with a view to enticing a suitable industry to locate at**

**this site.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan (K) stated that, for a considerable

number of years, he had been pointing out and actively promoting the potential use of the

very suitable landbank at Askeaton. He had had a number of meetings with Shannon

Development in this regard. He added that the landbank in question had been vacant for---
19

half a century. He stated that while he welcomed all of the new developments in the city

area, he felt that Askeaton represented an opportunity for very beneficial development.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).

**REPLY:**

The Askeaton landbank (200 acres approx.) is in the ownership of the

Shannon Group and it is zoned for industrial use. It is also identified as one of

six strategic sites suitable for industrial development in the Strategic

Integrated Framework Plan (SIFP) for the Shannon Estuary. The landbank is

included in all promotional and marketing material issued by Limerick City

and County Council, Shannon Foynes Port Company, SIFP stakeholders as a

location for investment and development. The Council continues to work

with the Shannon Group, the IDA and other interested groups regarding the

identification of suitable projects for the site.

The Chief Executive stated that Management had had a meeting with the Shannon

Group since the lands in question were in the ownership of the Shannon Group. It was

hoped to progress the matter in the near future.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Department of Agriculture to**

**reimburse the Council for the full cost of horse control in Limerick.**

In proposing the Motion, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh said the Council should not have to carry

the bulk of the cost of horse control in the City and County. He added that the Department

of Agriculture only covered one-third of the cost of horse control in Limerick which cost

approximately €500,000 per year. He concluded by calling on the Department of Agriculture

to reimburse the Council in full for the collection and impounding of wandering horses.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Government and the Minister**

**for Education and Skills to award a set number of extra points, not exceeding twenty-five**

**(25) (under the Leaving Certificate Points System), to 5th and 6th year students who**

**participate in a formally assessed programme of engagement with the elderly and other**

**vulnerable people in their community. The purpose of this programme is to help elderly**

**and other vulnerable people identified by the HSE and/or Department of Social Protection**

**to continue living in their ownhomes.**

Councillor Lynch, in proposing the Motion, requested that the Council call on the

Government to award a set number of points, not exceeding 25, in the Leaving Certificate to

students who participated in a formally assessed programme of engagement with the

elderly and other vulnerable people in their community. He explained that there might be a

mechanism for awarding these points through the Leaving Certificate. Vocational---
20

Programme (L.C.V.P). He added that it would be important for the programme to have a

clear and easily understood structure. He said that engagement would be mainly social in

nature with an emphasis on visiting, chatting, listening and reassuring the vulnerable/elderly

people in question. The elderly would feel supported in a very practical way in their own

homes and in their own communities and would learn about their own communities and

about their young neighbours, their news, interests and concerns. He stated that Garda

Vetting would be a requirement for participants. In addition, procedures regarding safe

working practices would need to be incorporated into the programme. He concluded by

highlighting the many benefits for the students, elderly and those vulnerable in society.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Donegan paid tribute to the sterling work

carried out by students in their community and, in particular, made reference to work

undertaken by Transition Year students.

The Motion received unanimous support and it was felt that it could be an exciting

and innovative approach to help tackle rural isolation experienced by those most

vulnerable.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on Minister**

**Creed to relax the criteria for the Young Farmer Scheme as regards educational**

**requirements. As it currently stands, the strict deadlines for enrolment in FETAC level 6**

**courses means that many worthy applications are automatically excluded from the**

**scheme. With farming uptake by young people at an all-time low, this Council considers it**

**of the upmost importance that proper incentives are given to young people to get**

**involved in farming activities and that the legislation in place is as inclusive as possible.**

**This Council also calls on the Minister to recognise that the competence for setting**

**educational criteria and their enforcement is a matter for the Irish Department of**

**Agriculture and not a European competence. In fact, only 10 out of 28 EU Member States**

**have chosen to adopt educational criteria as a prerequisite for availing of Young Farmer**

**funds. Young farmers face an increasingly complex set of barriers when trying to get on an**

**even footing in their sector. The Minister cannot continue to deny responsibility when it**

**comes to breaking down some of those obstacles.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Browne stated that only 7% of Irish farmers

were under the age of 35. The 2013 CAP reforms set out to encourage the uptake of

farming activities by young people by offering additional “young farmer payments.” This

reform defined ‘Young Farmer’ as anyone under the age of 40 who had taken up farming

within the previous 5 years. Although these first two criteria were universal within the EU,

the Irish Government had chosen to apply an educational requirement which compelled

participants to be enrolled in a FETAC level 6 course in order to apply. He stated that there

were long waiting lists to get onto those courses and that the Department was stating that

the rules could not be changed. He added that there was nothing in the EU Regulations

preventing the Irish Government from changing the date of enrolment or any other criteria

so that anyone who had applied to take part in an educational course could avail of the

payment.---

The Motion was seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and agreed.

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council oppose the closure**

**of any Post Offices across Rural Ireland and call on the Government to commit to the**

**survival of the Post Office Network in rural Ireland by encouraging people to use it to**

**collect their payments from Government Departments, instead of insisting on electronic**

**transfer.**

Councillor Sheehy, in proposing the Motion, stated that action was needed to

protect the Rural Post Office Network. She expressed her concern regarding reports that 80

post office branches could close across rural Ireland. She said that rural post offices across

Ireland and County Limerick must be protected and their services enhanced. She added that

the Post Office was a core component of the viability of small towns and villages and that its

removal would have a negative knock-on effect for other services. She highlighted the

damage that had already been done to rural communities by the closure of shops, public

houses and schools. She asked for the Members’ support in relation to the Motion and

concluded by stating that future expansion of services provided by the Post Office Network

would be essential for their long term viability.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Browne and agreed.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Council agree to make a submission to the**

**Environmental Protection Agency registering its opposition to Irish Cement’s proposal to**

**burn tyres and other rubbish in its plant in Limerick.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Prendiville requested that the Council make a

submission to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registering its opposition to Irish

Cement’s proposal to burn tyres and other rubbish in its plant in Limerick.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.

Several Members raised questions regarding the legality of the Council making such

a submission and it was felt that legal advice should be sought.

The Chief Executive stated that the Executive of the Council would be making a

submission to the EPA which would be made available to the Members. In addition, the

Members were welcome to meet with the Consultants to seek further clarification.

Following considerable discussion, it was agreed to refer this item to the Mayor and

Party Leaders for further consideration.---

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Keller

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs**

**and the Minister for Transport urging them to: (i) take action to ensure Shannon Airport is**

**President Trump’s reported support for torture methods, immediately implement**

**inspections and oversight of all planes that may be involved in the transport of prisoners,**

**We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the**

**Minister for Education to include the victims of the sexual and physical abuse suffered in**

**Creagh Lane Primary School in the redress scheme. The victims in question have fought**

**long and hard and their lives have been undermined and, in some cases, destroyed as a**

Meeting.

24A Notice of Motion submitted by Mayor K. O’Hanlon

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council note the campaign**

**of the National Union of Journalists’ Local News Matters Week. The campaign is aimed at**

**highlighting the importance of properly resourced independent media to the functioning**

**of democracy at local and regional levels. Limerick City and County Council recognises the**

**importance of local media in reporting on local government and informing citizens about**

**the work undertaken on their behalf by elected representatives and local authorities and**

**agencies. Local media also reflect the concerns of citizens and provide a platform for civic**

**participation in dialogue on all aspects of community life. Journalists engaged by media**

**organisations: print, broadcasting and online, face many challenges, including increased**

**workloads, reduced resources, and lower staffing levels. This Council urges media**

**organisations to provide journalists with the level of resources necessary to ensure**

**accurate and comprehensive coverage of local democracy. This Council reaffirms its**

**commitment to make information available to the local media and to providing**

**appropriate facilities for journalists attending Council meetings.**

2. Deputation

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Kantoher Development Group and outlined
the format for the presentation. He stated that as a local person, he was immensely proud of

drive and commitment shown by them in bringing employment back to the area. The
Deputation consisted of Messrs. Colman Deely (Chairman), Joe Kelleher (Secretary), Jack
O'Connor (Board Member) and Ms. Trish O'Sullivan (Innovate Limerick).

Mr. O'Connor addressed the Meeting and stated that it was a great opportunity for the Group to

support the Group had received from Limerick City and County Council and other state

agencies.

He gave a presentation under the following headings:

the future. They stated that the Group was a great example of what could be achieved.

Councillor Collins, as the current Cathaoirleach of the Municipal District of Newcastle West, to
the board of the Newcastle West Development Association.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach and as agreed at the outset of the Meeting, a report
on a Review of Newcastle West Pool Feasibility Impact Study was then discussed.

Review of Newcastle West Pool Feasibility Impact Study

The Director stated that the report, which had been carried out by BDO concluded that the
provision of another pool in Newcastle West would have a significant impact on facilities in the
area. He said, having carefully considered the report Management’s advice was not to proceed-
with a local authority led Swimming Pool in Newcastle West at this time. He added that there
was not a sufficient business case for a local authority led new pool in Newcastle West.

Varying views were expressed by the Members on the report by BDO and, following a short
discussion, it was agreed that the Members would reflect on the matter further and that the
item would be included on Agenda for the next Meeting.

QUESTIONS

7. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed update on the footpath in Ballyagran.

REPLY: Works have commenced on the footpath at Ballyagran and it is expected that
these works will be completed within the next two weeks. The installation of

public lighting as part of these works is also progressing.

8. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed update on the Traffic Management Plan for
Abbeyfeale.

REPLY: The Council is in the process of completing two house purchases at the junction
of Colbert Terrace and Athea Road R524 to accommodate proposed road
widening. The Traffic Management Plan is currently being revised and updated. A
finalized drawing will be ready for discussion with Councillors next month.

Members asked that a discussion would take place on the Traffic Management Plan for
Abbeyfeale prior to it going on Public display. It was proposed to hold a workshop after the
November Meeting of the District.

9. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will ask at the next Meeting for an update on (a) riverbank along by the treatment plant
Abbeyfeale; (b) riverbank at the back of New Street, Abbeyfeale.

Irish Water generally does not attend District Meetings but will be happy to meet
with the Members on the clinic meetings in Dooradoyle. Two elected Members
attended the most recent clinic on 25" September. Irish Water will contact the
elected Members directly and advise when the next clinic is planned.

(b) In relation to the riverbank at New Street, Abbeyfeale, we received a
response from OPW stating that the purpose of the Minor Works Scheme is to
provide funding to Local Authorities to address localized flooding problems. They
stated that the matter of riverbank erosion is not covered by this scheme.

The OPW indicated that the works described in the Council’s application were
mainly related to the protection of the bank of the river from erosion and as such
the proposed works do not provide any protection from flooding to the existing
property. The erosion is not leading to an undermining of a flood defense and
therefore does not qualify for funding under the Minor Works Scheme.

Members raised the issue of erosion of riverbank at a particular property and stated that unless
works were carried out it could be an ecological issue. The Senior Executive Engineer stated that
he would try and clarify what scheme was previously used when work was undertaken in a

similar situation.
10. ion i ncillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting when the issue of subsiding gullies along Boherbui, Newcastle
West is likely to be resolved.

| will ask at the next if a yield/stop sign can be put in place at the Desmond Business Park
Junction with the public road towards various farm land at Dungeeha in the interest of public

safety.

REPLY: The matter will be investigated and a response will issue as soon as possible.

12. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will ask at the next Meeting what the up-to-date position is with the review of speed limits
within the Municipal District.

REPLY: The Council previously sought submissions in relation to the proposed speed limit
review, These submissions have been considered by the Municipal and Metropolitan

submissions and these issues are currently being addressed.

NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will move at the next Meeting that proper and adequate signage be put in place along the
Great Southern Greenway to advise dog owners to keep their dogs on a lead at all times.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated when works would be completed on the
Greenway it would be a great success. Farmers with land adjoining the Greenway had concerns
with walkers using the Greenway and not keeping their dogs under control.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY: Under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 it is an offence for a person in charge of a dog
in a public place not to keep it under effectual control. Signs requesting owners to
keep dogs under close control will be ordered and will be erected on the Great
Southern Greenway Limerick as soon as they are delivered.

Bye-Laws will have to be introduced on the Great Southern Greenway Limerick if we
want to ensure dogs are kept on a lead at all times and this can now be considered.

14, Notice of Motions submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will move at the next Meeting that a safety survey be carried out at the junction known
locally as Lees Cross on the Bruff line (R521).

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that it was a very dangerous junction and
asked that traffic calming measures and signage would be looked at.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

In response the Senior Executive Engineer stated that he was well aware of the junction in
question and lack of funding was an issue. A study would need to be carried out to identify a
long term solution to the problem. He said funding could be made available from the GMA

2018 fund.

It was agreed to hold the November Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 8 November, 2017
at 10.00 a.m. at Aras William Smith OBrien, Newcastle West.

This concluded the Meeting.

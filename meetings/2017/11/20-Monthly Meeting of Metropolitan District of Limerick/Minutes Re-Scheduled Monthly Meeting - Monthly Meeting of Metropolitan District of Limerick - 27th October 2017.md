**Proposed Additions to the Record of Protected Structures**

Circulated, Report of the Senior Manager, Planning and Environmental Services Department

dated 6th October, 2017 setting out the legal and procedural background to the addition of---
2

records to the Record of Protected Structures and recommending the following proposed

additions to same :

P.P.S. 2017 / A Former R.I.C. / Garda Barracks at Barnakyle, Patrickwell;

P.P.S. 2017 / I Quaker Meeting House and Burial Ground at Ballinacurra (Bowman), Limerick

P.P.S. 2017 / J Military Cemetery and Lodge, King’s Island, Limerick.

**Former R.I.C. / Garda Barracks at Barnakyle, Patrickwell**

Circulated, Report dated 16th October, 2017 setting out details of the proposed addition of the

former Garda / R.I.C. Barracks, Ref. No. P.P.S. 2017/A to the Record of Protected Structures.

The following points were made by Members opposing the proposed addition :

• Development of the structure would not proceed, if protected, and it would continue to

detract from the visual aspect of Patrickswell and this should be taken into consideration in

conjunction with the urban renewal of Patrickswell.

• There were no plans by the owner to demolish or change the structure.

• Any efforts to bring residential units into a habitable state should be supported, in view of

the current housing crisis.

• This is not the original Barracks in Patrickswell and the existing planning permission system

will protect those parts of the building that merit same.

• The financial support associated with protected buildings was inadequate and the costs

associated with developing the building, as a protected structure, would make the project

unviable.

The following points were made by Members in support of listing the property :

• The building had served many functions and its historical value should be taken into

consideration.

• Including the building on the record of protected structures would guarantee its protection.

• Every effort should be made to maintain the existing streetscapes in towns and villages.

• The building was rated of regional significance, with original features still in place and

represented part of our social history.

The Conservation Officer noted that the building contained original roofing slate, windows and

rain water goods and that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has issued a

Ministerial Recommendation, on foot of Section 53 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000

(as amended) in respect of the building and as a result, should the Members decide not to add

the building to the Record of Protected Structures, their reasons for not doing so would have to

be recorded and submitted to the Minister. In response to clarification sought from Councillors,

the Conservation Officer stated that Section 2 of the Planning and Development Act specifically

required alterations to roofing, windows and doors of character to have planning permission and

also made the point that Policies in the Development Plan sought the protection of historic

streetscapes.

A motion was proposed by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Lynch that the former

Police / Garda Barracks, Barnakyle, Patrickwell, Limerick, Ref. No. P.P.S. 2017/A should not be

added to the Record of Protected Structures as, in view of the policy to encourage people to live---
3

in our towns and villages and in response to the national housing crisis, Members were of the

view that, if listed for protection, it would become unviable to develop the building as residential

accommodation and that the character of the building could be protected by the planning

legislation associated with the planning permission process.

The Mayor called for a vote on this motion, which resulted as follows:

**In favour**

Councillors Butler, Collins, Daly, Gilligan, Leddin, Lynch, O’Dea, Pond and Sheahan

(9)

**Against**

Councillors Costelloe, Hogan, Hourigan, Keller, McCreesh, Ó Ceallaigh, Prendiville and Secas.

(8)

should not be added to the Record of Protected Structures in accordance with Sections 53, 54

and 55 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) as, in view of the policy to

encourage people to live in our towns and villages and in response to the national housing crisis,

Members are of the view that, if listed for protection, it would become unviable to develop the

building as residential accommodation and that the character of the building could be protected

by the planning legislation associated with the planning permission process”.

**Quaker Meeting House and Burial Ground at Ballinacurra (Bowman), Limerick**

Circulated, Report dated 16th October, 2017 setting out details of the proposed addition of the

Quaker Meeting House and Burial Ground at Ballinacurra (Bowman), Limerick City, Ref. No. P.P.S.

2017/I to the Record of Protected Structures.

Members queried why the Quaker Meeting House, a relatively modern building, was being

proposed for protection. The Conservation Officer noted that the building represented good

architecture and the heritage of the future.

Proposed by Councillor Leddin;

Seconded by Councillor Collins;

And Resolved:---
4

“That the Quaker Meeting House and Burial Ground in the townland of Ballinacurra (Bowman),

Limerick, Ref. No. P.P.S. 2017/I be added to the Record of Protected Structures in accordance

with Sections 53 and 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended)”.

**Military Cemetery and Lodge, King’s Island, Limerick**

Circulated, Report dated 16th October, 2017 setting out details of the proposed addition of the

Military Cemetery and Lodge, King’s Island, Limerick Ref. No. P.P.S. 2017/J to the Record of

Protected Structures.

Following discussion it was agreed that the Lodge would not be added to the Record of

Protected Structures and the Conservation Officer noted that the Members would not have to

list reasons for same as there was no related Ministerial Recommendation, on foot of Section 53

of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

Proposed by Councillor Butler;

Seconded by Councillor Collins;

And Resolved:

“That the Military Cemetery at King’s Island, Limerick Ref. No. P.P.S. 2017/J be added to the

Development Act 2000 (as amended) and Part VIII of the Planning and Development Regulations

2001 (as amended) in relation to the proposed N24 Beary’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme.

The report noted that, as the proposed scheme was located in both the Metropolitan District

area and the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District area, the proposed scheme was being

brought to both Districts for consideration and discussion and would be brought to the

November Meeting of the Full Council for approval.

Members noted the contents of the report, as circulated, and welcomed the proposed works. In

response to an enquiry from Members, the Senior Engineer, Mid West National Road Design

Office noted that, given the need to acquire land as part of the project, it was anticipated that---
5

the earliest time work would commence, on site, would be 2019.

Expenditure and Reform for Ministerial approval.

Once the plans are approved, it is the intention of the OPW to publish a national

prioritised list of schemes that will proceed to the design stage with the relevant

Local Authority.

It is not known when the announcement will be made by the Minister and

therefore, the Council are not in a position at this stage to indicate a timeframe

Once the announcement is made by the Minister, the Council will arrange a

meeting with the OPW in order to progress the Limerick Flood Relief Schemes.

***I will ask at the next Meeting what plans there are for the Old Thomond Weir site at O’Dwyers***

***Villas, Thomondgate.***

**REPLY:**

The Thomond Weir site is currently being used under licence on a temporary

basis, to facilitate the restoration of a barge. The existing building on the site has

been cleared back to a ‘shell and core’ state. It is envisaged, given its sound

structural condition, that this building will be retained for appropriate re use.

There is development potential for the remainder of the site in conjunction with

other lands in this area owned by Limerick City and County Council.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the current status of the plans for the internal***

***buildings at Mungret College.***

**REPLY**:

LCCC has instructed Limerick 2030 DAC to develop a high level masterplan for the

Mungret site. Stage 1 includes a Masterplan and development appraisal including

**13**.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, what progress has been made towards streaming Metropolitan***

***District Meeting online for the public to follow, or watch back, as in other Council’s across the***

***country.***

**REPLY**:

No progress has been made in relation to the streaming of Metropolitan

Meetings online. This is a matter which would require consideration at

Metropolitan District level and would require an amendment of Standing Orders---
7

to allow for same.

Issues such as the capital costs of equipment to facilitate the process and the

ongoing running costs, together with additional administration, would need to be

taken into account prior to making a decision in relation to such a matter.

It is recommended that the matter be submitted, as an item for consideration, to

the next Protocol Committee Meeting of the Council.

**14**.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, what progress has been made on agenda last year to organise a***

***forum between the council, third level institutions in the city and the students unions in those***

***institutions to discuss the crisis in student accommodation in the Metropolitan District.***

**REPLY:**

The provision of student accommodation is primarily drive by the third level

institutions and the private sector. Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) is

cognisant that all aspects of the housing market are intertwined and welcomes

initiatives such as the new legislation to give increased power to support lending

by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to Higher Education Institutions (HEI).

Initial discussions indicate the possibility of demand for funding further supply of

up to 6,000 student accommodation units nationally, over the period to 2020.

Limerick City and County Council’s focus at present is on addressing the

increasing levels of homeless families living in B&B / Hotel accommodation and

the provision of accommodation for those on the housing waiting list.

***outages across the Metropolitan District of Limerick.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.---
8

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that the notice given by Irish Water of

planned water outages was inadequate and at times the Council only learned of a planned

outage the night before it was due to take place.

Members discussed the consequences for businesses and those providing community services

of inadequate notice. Members requested that notices from Irish Water in relation to planned

water outages contain more specifics in relation to outages and that Members be copied with

details of outages at the same time the Council was informed.

Members also requested that they receive advance notice of road works undertaken by Irish

Water and raised issues in relation to the adequacy of traffic management at these works.

In response to a query from Members, the Director, Physical Development noted that, in the

event of a claim made against the Council arising from road works, any contractor or statutory

agency involved would be joined in the proceedings.

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council, on behalf of Irish Water, update the Irish Water

website, water.ie of all details on planned and unplanned outages. The

Councillors of the Metropolitan District are also emailed and advised of the

outages. Irish Water will be copied on the Notice of Motion.

Public Representatives have been assigned a designated email account,

localrepsupport@water.ie and Irish Water also provide clinics for public

representatives.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe (to be referred to the Home and**

**Social Development SPC)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on the Minister for Health to adequately***

***staff child mental health services in Limerick City.***

It was agreed that this Motion be referred to the Home and Social Development SPC for

consideration.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Authority will make provision in the 2018 Budget for***

***people with disabilities in association with Limerick’s positive ageing initiative.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Hourigan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hurley referred to Ireland’s Ageing population and the fact

that medical and social advances would increase the number of people living with disabilities

and disabling conditions in the community. She noted that the Council had introduced a

number of measures to improve participation for people with disabilities and their families and

that the National Convention of Older People, to be held in Limerick in the coming week, would

be supported by the Executive of the Council. Councillor Hurley stressed the importance of the

United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which set out

how enjoyment of human rights were to be promoted and protected to enable people with---
9

disabilities to live full lives in the community, and pointed out that Ireland had signed same in

March 2007, thereby committing to its ratification and progressive implementation. She noted

that ratification committed all Local Authorities to an ongoing programme of action to support

people with disabilities to live fully in their communities and called on Local Authorities to exert

influence on and work with other public, civic and private entities to advance the full

participation of people with disabilities living within their areas. Councillor Hurley highlighted

some of the barriers that exclude and inhibit people with disabilities such as economic

pressures; lack of appropriate accessible private and social housing; lack of accessible and

readily available public transport, parking and public spaces; and difficulties in finding and

retaining employment and called for the Council to budget and plan for 2018 and beyond to

advance the implementation of the UNCRPD.

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation SPC)**

***the market for the duration of the Saturday market.***

It was agreed that this Motion be referred to the Travel and Transportation SPC for

consideration.

**20.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be referred to the**

**Community, Leisure & Emergency Services SPC / Home and Social Development SPC)**

***I will move at the next meeting that we call for the Council owned lands in Mungret, suitable***

***for housing, to be developed by the Council as a mix of social and affordable housing, as a***

***matter of urgency.***

It was agreed that this Motion be referred to the Community, Leisure and Emergency Services

SPC Home and Social Development SPC for consideration.

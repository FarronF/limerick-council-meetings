**from the N21 onto the L1427. This junction is located at the Limerick side of the**

**Lantern Roundabout in Adare.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey noted that TII had agreed to carry out

modifications to the road markings on the N21, on the approaches to the Mount Earl

Junction, by relocating the right turn arrows and adjusting the layout to provide extra

width to allow vehicles to pass queuing right turn traffic. A full right turn lane would not

be provided, however, as the existing pavement was not wide enough.

Councillor Teskey highlighted the continued danger of motorists speeding into vehicles

waiting to turn right at this location and requested that TII re-examine their proposals in

relation to this location.

Members supported the Motion and noted that a box should have been included as part

of the recent works and called on TII to re-examine this location.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this local authority consider a pedestrian crossing**

**to facilitate the students at Rathkeale No2 National School at Church Street, Rathkeale**

**and upgrading of relevant road markings to identify the school for the mainstream**

**traffic that enter and leave the town at this point.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey requested that the location be surveyed and

the works, as proposed, costed.

Members supported the Motion and noted the importance of carrying out any survey

when the school was open.

**REPLY:**

In order to determine if a pedestrian crossing is justified we will have to

carry out a site assessment, this will require a comprehensive on-site

traffic and pedestrian survey.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division noted that it was

hoped to complete the survey before the end of the year.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien**

Council, TII and the Minister for Transport on this issue. He called on the Minister for

Transport to intervene in this matter and take steps to ensure that the required works

were carried out and requested that the Minister visit the District in this regard. On the

proposal of Councillor O’Brien, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue it was agreed that

this issue should appear as a recurring item on future District Meeting Agendas.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council submitted a proposed traffic calming

scheme for Kilcornan to TII for approval and funding earlier this year.

Queries were received last July on the cost element of the project. These

were addressed and submitted to them promptly. Limerick City and

County Council has not had any further update on the scheme progression

since then other than to schedule a meeting for Thursday, 12th October to

discuss the design submitted. Central Services will update the Members

following this meeting.

Towns Report, this matter was in need of urgent attention.

**REPLY:**

In relation to the Tidy Towns findings, the Council agree to carry out

depot in Kilcornan, in the short term. In 2018 we propose to upgrade the

entrance subject to the required funding being available.

**Correspondence**

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the consent of the Cathaoirleach the following

issues were raised by Members:
---

• It was noted that horses had been moved from a site at Abbeycourt, Rathkeale

and, combined with the fact that Council staff had been seen inspecting the site,

this had given rise to rumours that the site was to be developed as a temporary

halting site. In this regard a petition, that the site not be developed as a halting

site, had been completed and was now being submitted to the executive of the

Council. The Administrative Officer, Rathkeale Office noted that the removal of

horses from Council lands had been carried out on behalf of the Council at all

such locations in Rathkeale and confirmed that any horse owners who wished to

avail of grazing on Council lands should contact the Council’s Property Section.

She noted, further that any site inspections carried out had been on foot of the

Facilitator’s Report.

Councillor McMahon pointed out that she was a member of the Traveller

Accommodation Committee and stressed that, while plans were in place to

upgrade four existing sites, no new sites were being proposed.

The Members suggested that the Council make a statement to clarify the position

on the above and a Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by

Councillor O’Donoghue that the community in the area were not in favour of a

new halting site in Rathkeale.

• Councillor McMahon raised concerns regarding the safety of the incomplete car

park at Cluain Mhuire and requested an update in relation to same.

• Councillor Teskey noted that the Ballyhahill Development Association had

engaged with GAS Networks Ireland in relation to filling in a roadside dyke on the

Loughill Road and requested that the Council provide any assistance possible in

this regard.

• Councillor O’Donoghue noted the extent to which certain public lights were being

replaced and requested details of the contract for the repair of public lighting for

the next Meeting.

• Councillor Keary requested an update on the provision of a sewer line, in

conjunction with the proposed road works in Adare. He noted that it was now

proposed to provide 20 rather than 30 social housing units in Adare and

Members requested details of which 10 units would not now be built.

Councillor Keary put forward a Motion, seconded by Councillor Teskey, that a

master plan for the site be developed and brought to the District, prior to the

Part VIII process, showing how the site would be serviced and including the

provision of sites.

Councillor Sheahan referred to previous discussion regarding the provision of

affordable sites in Adare and noted that he had been informed that a policy in
---

this regard would have to be developed. Councillor Sheahan put forward a

Motion, seconded by Councillor Keary that this policy be brought to the next

Meeting of the full Council and that Adare should be used as a pilot location for

the implementation of such policy.

• Councillor Sheahan queried as to whether work was planned at Curragh Chase

gates. The Executive Engineer, Rathkeale Area Office noted that work to improve

sight lines was planned at this location within the following two weeks.

• Councillor O’Brien welcomed the allocation that had been made by the

Government to Local Improvement Schemes but expressed disappointment that

the allocation had to be spent before the end of November. The Executive

Engineer, Rathkeale Area Office noted that six applicants in the area had been

written to on the previous week and so far one reply had been received. He

noted that these applications dated back to the years 2008 and 2009.

• Councillor Keary requested an update in relation to drainage work required at

Courtmatrix. The Executive Engineer, Rathkeale Area Office noted that

ownership at the location had been clarified.

• The Meetings Administrator referred to correspondence he had issued to

Members requesting agreement on a date to hold a Budgetary Plan 2018

Meeting. It was agreed that the Meeting would be held on Thursday, 26th

October, 2017 at 8.00 p.m. and be preceded by a workshop, on the same subject,

at 7.30 p.m.

This concluded the Meeting.

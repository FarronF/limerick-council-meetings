**Proposed Inspections of Overground Slurry Tanks**

Members noted a letter that had been sent by the Council to a number of farmers with

overground slurry holding facilities advising of pending inspections of same and pointed

out that farmers were expressing concern at the financial implications of these

inspections in terms of direct costs and possible reduction in single farm payment.

Members pointed out that such slurry holding tanks had been constructed in accordance

with Department of Agriculture Guidelines, with the assistance of Department Grants,

and subject to planning permission granted by the Council. Concerns were also raised

that farmers would now be expected to construct bunds to hold slurry temporarily, in

the event of a spillage from these slurry tanks, and Members discussed the viability of

such bunds in terms of their potential to hold rainwater and the dangers they posed to

children on the farm.

The Senior Executive Engineer expressed her disappointment that farmers had not

contacted Council staff to express these concerns and stressed that the letter and

related inspections were intended to highlight a number of issues, primarily concerned

with valve failure and management, that had lead to a number of serious slurry

discharges in the past years. The Senior Executive Engineer presented an overview of

these incidents along with the potential to install a ballcock controlled valve on

reception tanks, as a fail safe devise. She noted that the Council had been in contact

with the Department of Agriculture requesting that this arrangement be included in the

specification for overground slurry tanks and retrospective funding allocated to farmers

for its installation in existing systems.

Members thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for her presentation and noted the

importance of keeping Members informed of the Council’s activities in this regard. On

the proposal of Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue it was requested

that the details of the presentation be drawn up as a brochure for circulation to those

farmers already contacted, along with a covering letter outlining the Council’s concerns

and recommendations.

Members acknowledged the benefits of the ballcock controlled valve to control the flow

of slurry to reception tanks and discussed the possibility of including an electronic alarm

with same, in the event of its failure.

On the proposal of Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor Teskey it was agreed that a

Motion should go forward to the full Council in the name of the District calling on the

Department of Agriculture to grant aid the retrospective fitting of ballcock controlled

valves to control the discharge of slurry from overground slurry stores to adjacent

reception tanks.

This concluded the Meeting.

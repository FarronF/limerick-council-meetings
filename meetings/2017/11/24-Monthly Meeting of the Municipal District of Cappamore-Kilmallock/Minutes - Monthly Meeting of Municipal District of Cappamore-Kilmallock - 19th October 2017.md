It was stated that 2 of the submissions had been observational and did not require a

response; the remaining 7 were then outlined in full, as was the Designer’s response to each.

A lengthy discussion took place on this item and the following points/concerns were

made by the Members:

• To avoid isolation of the shop, could a fifth leg be included in design of the roundabout to

give direct access to the shop.

• Safety of road users was noted as being a priority.

Councillor Donegan, in referring to his submission, made the following points:

• The proposal to locate the stop for north-bound buses on the western side of the

realigned N20 entailed serious safety risks.

• The right-turn lane, which provided access to the filling station, was too short and

could potentially cause tailbacks to the roundabout.

• Could a fifth leg be added to the roundabout and could both bus stops be relocated

to the parking area.

Staff from the Mid-West National Road Design Office, and the Consultant, responded to

queries from the Members as follows:
---

• The accident frequency at 5-leg roundabouts was 1.6 times that associated with a 4-leg

roundabout. It was for this reason that under TII road design standards, the provision of

roundabouts of 5 legs or more was not recommended on national roads and, if provided,

had to be applied for as a departure from the standard.

• In relation to bus stop, to ensure safety of the public, speed limits would be in place, road

lighting would be provided in accordance with TII standards, and the scheme permitted the

installation of a controlled crossing at the location.

The Members noted the report and generally welcomed the proposed development.

Councillor Donegan, however, asked that his concerns as outlined above be noted.

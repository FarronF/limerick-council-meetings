fostering a programme like EVA International.

Arts Council. He suggested that it could be more productive and did not appear to benefit the

entire Community. Cllr. M Hurley praised the variety of locations used for EVA events and

wished M. Packer well.

M.Packer advised that the budget was €22,000 with €10,000 coming from Limerick City and

County Council. He stated that he was aware of the challenges but assured the members that

he was trying to reach a “grass roots common” with an openness to change which he saw as

crucial to the success of the project.---

**Presentation on Creative Ireland Limerick Culture Plan**

Sheila Deegan gave presentation on Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022 and advised the

members that the Council have established an internal culture team.

Cllr. Foley commented that Arts is alive and well in the City and County and fully supports

the publication.

Cllr. M.Sheahan thanked Sheila for her presentation and was pleased that it involved all

communities. Cllr. J.Loftus agreed and stated that Limerick was a city of multiple cultures

and he was proud to be a Limerick man.

Cllr. J.Costelloe felt that the Council missed an opportunity to honour members of the

McNamara Band from New York City who were home recently as three of the band had lived

in Mary Street originally. He also suggested a plaque could be restored on Mary Street.

Cllr. M. Hurley thanked Sheila Deegan on presentation and praised the travelling pop up

Museum and thanked Damien Brady for his input in same.

Cllr. S.Lynch commended Sheila and her team on all their hard work and great passion. Cllr.

B. Teefy thanked Sheila Deegan for presentation and felt the need for more emphasis on rural

communities as they need the support. She asked for more presence in East Limerick as there

was very little projects happening there at the moment.

**Item 4**

**Update on Suicide Prevention**

Cllr. L.M Sheehy gave an update on the last meeting of the Suicide Prevention group. She

advised the members that Jigsaw gave a presentation at same and that they have now opened

young people aged 12-25. It offers a range of services including counselling. Since 19th June

there has been 16 referrals made to Jigsaw. Cllr.S.Lynch asked if Jigsaw had an after hours

service. Cllr. L.M Sheehy advised that it was not a crisis service and that the Samaritans and

A& E Department would be the 1st points of contact.

next meeting to discuss same.

Cllr.L.M Sheehy will send out details of upcoming safe talk training for the members once

The following documents had been circulated with the agenda:

(a)

Copy of Requisition and background detail, as outlined above.

(b)

Copy of Legal Opinion received by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council dated

28th June, 2017, which was of relevance to the item.

(c)

Copy of second Independent Legal Opinion, received as the request of the Members

of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, and circulated at Meeting of Dún

Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on 11th September, 2017, which was also of

relevance to the item.

Councillor Collins (J), in opening the Meeting, stated that Limerick people were against

incineration. He would be calling on the Members of the Council to pass a Motion that they

were opposed to the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. This would send a

strong message to both industry and the broader community in relation to Limerick. He

expressed his concern at the threat to the food chain and referred to comments by the

Head of the Environmental Protection Agency recently that air pollution was responsible for

1,500 deaths, that there were no safe levels of pollutants and that the level of pollutants

was already above World Health Organisation Guidelines. He referred to the proposed

development of new houses in the Mungret area and at Greenpark, all of which were close

to the Irish Cement Ltd plant. He now wanted to amend both the County Development Plan

and the Southern Environs Local Area to prohibit incineration.

Councillor Collins (J) referred to the two sets of legal advice which had been circulated

which effectively meant that Members could not initiate the process to amend the plans in

place, even though they had been informed when the plans were being made that they

could revisit them at any stage. This, he felt, was not in accordance with the sentiments set

out in “Putting People First” and he expressed his disappointment that it was now a matter

for the Chief Executive to initiate the process and all Members could do was to ask him to

vary the plans. Members could adopt the plan but could not initiate the process to change

it. They could only vote on the plan / amendments if initiated by the Executive.

He then referred to the process for the preparation and approval of the Regional Waste

Management Plan which was an Executive Function. He pointed out that this plan sat

parallel to the Development Plan in the planning hierarchy but that the Waste Management

Plan has precedence over the Development Plan. He was therefore calling on the Members

to support five motions which he was putting forward as follows: -
---
4

1.

That Limerick City and County Council is opposed to the incineration of hazardous

and non-hazardous waste in Limerick.

2.

Call on the Chief Executive to initiate the process to amend the County Development

Plan and the Southern Environs Local Area Plan to -

(i) amend the Limerick County Development Plan 2016 (as extended) as follows: **The**

**written statement in respect of the Transport and Infrastructure Chapter to be**

**varied (Chapter 8 Objective 042) such that the following sentence be included as**

**the final sentence in this objective -“This excludes the incineration of hazardous**

**and non-hazardous waste;”** and

(ii) amend the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011-2017 (extended to 2021) as

follows: **The written statement in respect of the Southern Environs Local Area Plan**

**Development Strategy (Chapter 2.2) such that the following sentence be included**

**after the vision statement - “Having regard to the above, the incineration of**

**hazardous and non-hazardous waste shall be excluded from consideration within**

**the boundaries of this Local Area Plan for the duration of this plan.”**

If this is deemed illegal / ultra vires by the Chief Executive, call on the Chief Executive

to place a report of his legal advice before the Council detailing the reasons why.

3.

Request the Chief Executive to immediately commence the preparation of the new

combined City and County Development Plan.

4.

Ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to amend the

Southern Regional Waste Management Plan so as not to permit any further

incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in cement kilns.

5.

Ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to review the Local

Government (Reform) Act 2014 to allow Councillors to initiate an amendment to a

Development Plan and/or a Local Area Plan.

Councillor Lynch formally seconded the Motions as put forward.

Councillor Prendiville expressed the view that the Motions should be supported. He referred

to a Motion put forward by him at the recent Economic Development, Enterprise and

Planning Strategic Policy Committee Meeting held on 9th October, 2017, dealing with this

issue, and referred to the need for action to be taken to prevent future similar planning

applications.

A number of other Members spoke in support of the Motions referring to the dangers

associated with incineration given the possible dangers to both human health and animal

health and for the food chain, and to the fact that incineration was in use in University

Hospital Limerick and in a number of other industries already.

Councillor Sheahan (K) made a proposal that the Council would introduce a policy of

significant taxation which would be imposed on all users of incineration, so that this State

and its people would be fully and adequately compensated for the entire damage that

would be caused to the environment. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Teskey.

Councillor Teskey referred to the recent proposals from the Citizens’ Assembly to tackle

climate change and expressed his concerns at possible additional taxes on the farming

community as a result of such proposal. He proposed that Limerick City and County Council

write to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action

and the Environment that the Council opposed any taxation that could be put in place in

relation to the emission of gases from farm animals. This was seconded by Councillor

Sheahan (K).

Councillor Crowley proposed that the Council take the environmental impact of harmful

activities, such as, but not limited to, incineration and gasification into account when

considering to vary the rates. As a direct consequence of the negative impact on the

environment, it is the view of this Council that these industries pay a higher level of rates.

In response to a query from the Members, the Chief Executive pointed out that the Council

was operating in accordance with the National policy as set out by Government. He pointed

out that he while he did not wish to be acting in opposition to the wishes of the Members

on the matter, the legal position was that he had to act in accordance with national policy.

He would, however, work with the Council in relation to the issues raised and guide them in

relation to the legal issues. In relation to the reference to comments made by the Head of

the Environmental Protection Agency, he pointed out that he had heard some of the

comments on a radio interview and that the comments were not in relation to incineration

alone but also referenced pollution from cars and smoky coal amongst other matters and

should not be taken out of context.

In relation to the various Motions put forward by Councillor Collins (J), he advised as

follows: -

**Motion 1**

This was a matter for the Council. However, he pointed out that this Motion,

if approved, could have wider impacts and should be considered carefully

accordingly.
---

**Motion 2**

In relation to this Motion, he pointed out that in accordance with the legal

advice as circulated, the initiation of the variation process was a matter for

the Chief Executive and while, in the main, he would always work with the

Council on issues arising, the position in this case was that the Regional

Waste Plan held precedence over the County Development Plan which meant

he was not in a position to move on the request. He stated that he would

therefore seek legal advice on the matter as per the request and bring back a

report to the Council.

**Motion 3**

In relation to the request for the commencement of the new Development

Plan process, he pointed out that he was anxious to move forward on this

matter and committed to the research element commencing in Quarter 1

2018 following completion of the National Planning Framework by the end of

this year.

**Motion 4**

He pointed out that this was again a matter for the Members to consider.

**Motion 5**

This was also a matter for the Members and this was an area where further

guidance would be welcomed.

In relation to the other Motions brought forward, these were areas which required further

detailed consideration by the Members and should be referred to the appropriate Strategic

Policy Committee for full consideration as they had significant broader implications.

Following concerns raised in relation to the wording of Motion put forward by Councillor

Sheahan (K), Councillor Sheahan (K) pointed out that he wished to amend his Motion to

include “if incineration is permitted” after the words “introduce a policy of significant

taxation which would be imposed on all users of incineration.” This was seconded by

Councillor Teskey.

In conclusion, the Chief Executive stated that he would arrange to seek the legal advice as

requested and would bring a report on the matter back to the Members for consideration,

and again clarified that the legal advice being sought was “if the request to initiate the

process to amend the County Development Plan and the Southern Environs Local Area Plan

was deemed illegal/ultra vires by the Chief Executive, to place a report before the Council

setting out in detail the reasons why.” He also indicated that he would be happy to consider

any other legal advice that Elected Members might have and asked if there was any

particular Counsel that they wished to use in this instance.

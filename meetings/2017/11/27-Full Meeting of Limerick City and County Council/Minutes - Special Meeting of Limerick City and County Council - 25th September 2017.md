as follows:

“As Cathaoirleach of Adare-Rathkeale, I and my fellow Councillors are calling for a

Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council to discuss our disappointment

that despite a recommendation from Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the

Gaeltacht, Heather Humphries, who visited Knockfierna Hill, Ballingarry, Co.

Limerick, and at the time advised “that Knockfierna Heritage Site would be an ideal

location for the Commemoration but any application would have to be supported by

the Local Authority,” – this was not brought to the attention of the Local Councillors

by the Local Authority, as instructed by the Minister. This National Famine

Commemoration event will now be held in Ballingarry, Co. Tipperary.”

Signed: Councillors R. O’Donoghue, E. Ryan, K. Sheahan, G. Mitchell, J. Scanlan, A.

Teskey, M. Collins, C. McMahon.

Councillor O’Donoghue addressed the Meeting by stating that he was very

disappointed that the opportunity to host the National Famine Commemoration at the

Knocknafierna Hill site had been missed. He added that the matter should have been driven

by the Council but that it had never come before the District or Full Council for

consideration. He acknowledged the sterling work which had been done by the

volunteers/historical society.

A number of Members echoed the sentiments expressed by Councillor O’Donoghue

and also acknowledged the tremendous work that had been carried out by the historical

society.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (K), seconded by Councillor Ryan, it was

agreed to prepare a proposal regarding the possibility of hosting the event at Knocknafierna

Hill, Ballingarry, in 2018.

In response, The City and County Librarian outlined the background to The National

Famine Commemoration which was first established to commemorate the Great Irish

Famine with an annual National Famine Memorial Day. He stated that the annual National

Commemoration rotated between the four provinces of Ireland and he noted that the 2017

location (Tipperary), and 2018 location (not yet announced), had already been designated.

He then went on to outline the sequence of correspondence in relation to

representations made by Minister Patrick O’Donovan on behalf of Knockfierna Heritage

Society following the visit by Minister Humphreys to Knockfierna on 5th June, 2015, as

follows:

• Correspondence from Deputy O’Donovan’s Office to the Chief Executive dated 22nd July,

2015, requesting support from the Council to the hosting of the National Famine

Commemoration in Ballingarry, Limerick.

• Correspondence from the Community Department of Limerick City and County Council

to Deputy O’Donovan’s Office dated 13th August, 2015, stating that the Council would be

pleased to work with the Knockfierna Heritage Society to support and host the

Commemoration.

• Correspondence from Deputy O’Donovan’s Office to Limerick City and County Council

dated 17th August, 2015, confirming that the planned event for Munster was for 2017

and not 2016.

• Correspondence from Deputy O’Donovan’s Office to Limerick City and County Council

dated 23rd November, 2015, requesting a meeting with Council Officials and Knockfierna

Heritage Society in relation to the 2017 National Famine Commemoration. It was

pointed out that this meeting had not taken place.

The County and City Librarian then outlined the structures established to facilitate

the Year of Commemoration 2016 at political and administrative level. He explained the

application process to host the National Famine Commemoration. He stated that, in

general, the application to host the event would come from a local community group. He

added that a local community group had the option of submitting an application directly to

the Department without reference to the Local City/County Council or, alternatively, could

request the Council to commit its support when the application was being submitted to the

Department.

It was stated that no formal application to host the 2017 National Famine

Commemoration in Ballingarry had been made by the Knockfierna Heritage Society either

directly to the Department or to Limerick City and County Council. Therefore, neither the

Department nor the City and County Council were in a position to give consideration to

advance a formal application which they had not received.

He noted that Limerick City and County Council had confirmed in writing, in response

to representations made by Deputy O’Donovan, that the Council would be pleased to work

with Knockfierna Heritage Society to secure and host the 2017 National Famine

Commemoration. Therefore, the opportunity was there for the Knockfierna Heritage Society

to submit an application to the Department and state that they had support from the

Council.

He concluded that from 2019 onwards, Knockfierna Heritage Society had the

opportunity to submit an application to the Department and that Limerick City and Council

would be supportive of any such application.

This concluded the Meeting.

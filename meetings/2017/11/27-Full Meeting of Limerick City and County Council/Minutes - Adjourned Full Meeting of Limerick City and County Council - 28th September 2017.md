Raising of Loan to finance Works Programme of Limerick 2030

Strategic Development DAC

(d)

Granting of Loan Facility to Limerick 2030 Strategic Development

DAC

Circulated, report of the A/Head of Finance dated 19th September, 2017, in relation

to Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC.
---
3

The report related to Items 3 (c) raising of a loan to finance the works programme of

Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC, and 3 (d) granting of a loan facility to the

company.

The report stated that Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC was a company

which was 100% owned by Limerick City and County Council with the objective to plan and

develop key strategic sites in Limerick that would act as anchors for enterprise and

investment development across Limerick.

The Gardens International Site was currently under construction and due for

completion in mid-2018. On completion, it would be Limerick City Centre’s first LEED

(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold Office Building. The Council had

already approved a loan of €16m in relation to this development in 2016.

The Opera Site was currently in the statutory planning process. It was anticipated

that the site would become an employment campus which would provide new state-of-the-

art accommodation for offices, including the Revenue Commissioners, in addition to a range

of cultural, retail and other ancillary uses. Funding had been sought from European Banks in

relation to this development and it was anticipated that they would conclude their loan

approval process within the coming months. The value of loan funding sought was €170 m

and would be subject to specific covenants and pre-lets.

The Council was being requested to consider (i) approving application for sanction

from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government for a loan of €170m to

finance the works programme of Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC; and (ii) granting

a loan facility in the amount of €170m to Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC.

Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC would undertake to repay all monies

received to the Council as outlined in the loan agreement.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Galvin;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to application for sanction

from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in accordance with Section

106 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, for a loan of €170 million to finance

the works programme of Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC.”

A number of Members expressed concern as to the lack of clarity in relation to the

detail of projects to be undertaken by Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC and, in

particular, the Opera Site, and it was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, seconded by

Councillor Loftus, that this item be adjourned until a Briefing was held on the development,

with adequate notice given to Councillors.
---

The Chief Executive stressed the importance of distinguishing between the loan, to

enable the work of Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC, and any related Part VIII

process that would be brought before the Members for approval. He indicated that a

briefing on the work of Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC would be arranged but

stressed the importance of ensuring that there was no compromise to the planning process

in advance of a Part VIII being brought before the Members and, in relation to the Opera

Site, pointed out that he was taking advice as to whether the related Part VIII should be

brought before the Metropolitan District or the Full Council.

It was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Hourigan, that the

Council should proceed with the granting of a loan facility to Limerick 2030 Strategic

Development DAC. It was agreed that a vote on this proposal would be taken in the form of

a show of hands. The majority of the Members were in favour of the Motion, with 18 for the

Motion and 6 against.  Accordingly, the Mayor declared the Motion carried and it was

agreed that the following resolution be adopted by the same voting:

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Hourigan;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the granting of a loan

facility to Limerick 2030 Strategic Development DAC of €170 million, in accordance with

Section 66 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended.”

(e)

Change in Membership – Strategic Policy Committees

On the proposal of Councillor Collins (M), seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J),

changes in membership of Strategic Policy Committees were approved as follows:

• The appointment of Councillor Crowley to the Economic Development, Enterprise and

Planning Strategic Policy Committee to replace Councillor Collins (M),

• The appointment of Councillor Collins (M) to the Environment Strategic Policy

Committee to replace Councillor Crowley.

(f)

Amended Strategic Policy Committee Scheme

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Officer, Corporate Services, dated 20th

September, 2017, together with Draft Amended Strategic Policy Committee Scheme 2017-

2019. The amended scheme had been prepared, in accordance with Guidelines received

from the Department, to include the addition of a new Cultural Strategic Policy Committee

following the establishment of the new Committee at the July Meeting.

Members stressed the importance of the Arts and Culture Sector having

representation on a Cultural Strategic Policy Committee and noted that this might not be

feasible under the proposed structure. Members suggested that an additional four places be
---
5

allocated on the Cultural Strategic Policy Committee to be filled directly from the Arts and

Culture Section.

The Meetings Administrator acknowledged the lack of representation for the Arts

and Culture Sector under the existing structures represented by National Pillars and the

Public Participation Network and noted that the Strategic Policy Committee structure would

be redrawn to match the Council’s new Operating Model in 2019 with the formation of a

new Council.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Galvin;

And Resolved:

“That, the Draft Amended Strategic Policy Committee Scheme 2017-2019 is agreed,

subject to the amendment to include the addition of four representatives from the Arts and

Culture Sector to the Cultural Strategic Policy Committee.”

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting (a) how many State Agencies are responsible for the River***

***Galey in Athea; (b) when will the proposed drainage works begin; and (c) what works***

***exactly are to be carried out.***
---
9

**REPLY:**

(a) Athea is an area that was considered for detailed flood risk assessment,

and appraisal of options to manage flood risk, under the Shannon Catchment-

based Flood Risk Assessment & Management (CFRAM) Study which was led

by the Office of Public Works (OPW). Detailed flood mapping has been

prepared for Athea and options for managing flood risk in the village have

been considered. Following consultation on the Draft Flood Risk

Management Plan for the Tralee Bay-Feale River Basin (UoM23) in the

second half of 2016, the final Plan for this region has been prepared and has

been sent for consideration by the Minister for Public Expenditure and

Reform. The River Galey in Athea is not within the remit of the OPW for

maintenance and is subject to maintenance by the riparian owner. The works

that are proposed in the RIver Galey in Athea under the CFRAM Study can be

carried out by Limerick City and County Council as the cost of the works is

within the OPW-funded Minor Works Programme threshold.

(b) It is hoped by the OPW that the national suite of plans will

receive approval within the coming weeks, after which the Plans will be

presented to the Local Authorities and the public. As the works in Athea are

minor in the scale of national projects, it is likely that they could be

implemented by Limerick City and County Council under the OPW-funded

Minor Works Programme, subject to environmental assessment, public

consultation and detailed design. The announcement with regard to approval

of funding for all proposed works is still awaited from the Department so a

definitive date for works to commence cannot be determined at this

time. Limerick City and County Council has employed an Executive Engineer

whose role is to work on all CFRAM projects.

(c) The Plan for the Tralee Bay-Feale River Basin includes a proposed measure

for Athea, which includes approximately 150m embankment on the east bank

upstream of the Bridge and approximately 150m flood wall on the west bank

downstream of the Bridge. The proposed scheme is designed to a standard

of protection against the 1:100 annual probability flood event.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a list of all Council-owned land zoned Residential and all***

***other lands deemed suitable for residential development, subject to zoning, and for***

***confirmation of estimated timeframe for the building of social and/or affordable houses.***

**REPLY:**

The Assessment for Selecting Sites for Housing (ASH) for Limerick City was

developed by Limerick City and County Council to identify, in an objective and

consistent manner, suitable Council-owned sites for housing in appropriate

locations. The policy was presented at the Housing Strategic Policy

Committee on 11th April, 2016. A total of 23 of the 80 Council-owned sites

located in the Limerick City area have passed the strategic constraints filter

(zoning, flood risk, environmental designations, etc.) with a number of
---
10

sites deemed developable in the short to medium term for housing and are

identified in Table 1 below. Since April 2016, a number of landbanks have

been progressed and funding obtained from the Department of Housing,

Planning and Local Government for social housing.

In relation to Council-owned sites in Limerick City and County generally, the

Executive of Limerick City and County Council is currently assessing and

preparing a Strategic Development and Management Plan for the earliest

possible development of Council-owned lands for social, affordable and

private tenure in accordance with Circular APH 02/2017 issued by the

Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. Limerick City and

County Council will be in a position to issue a Strategic Development and

Management Plan by 30th September, 2017, listing all Council sites zoned

residential and other Council lands suitable for residential use. A yield of

units in terms of a minimum density threshold will also be listed for each site,

in addition to an estimated timeframe for delivery. The Strategic

Development and Management Plan will be made available for viewing to the

Elected Members.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting has any consideration been given to allowing people to add***

***themselves to the Register of Electors using an online form as an alternative to the current***

***paper form; would this require changes to national legislation, and could it be piloted in***

***Limerick.***

**REPLY:**

While the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local

Registration Authority, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local
---
12

Government has commenced work on the modernisation of the voter

registration process. This is in the context of facilitating the registration of

voters resident outside the State, in the event of an extension of the

franchise at Presidential Elections being approved by the people in a

referendum. All aspects of voter registration, including online applications,

will be reviewed as part of this project.

At present, Dublin Local Authorities are piloting an ongoing voter.ie project

(developed by Avnet) that is to include an online portal, and have been

developing that over the last number of years. It is envisaged that this piloted

system will be rolled out nationally once complete. To date, national

legislation has not been changed to facilitate this.

**12.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many acres of Council-owned lands in Mungret are***

***zoned Residential,**how many houses can be located on the site in accordance with***

***average recommended density for the area and what is the proposed timeline for***

***developing this site***

**REPLY:**

An application for funding was made under the Local Infrastructure Housing

Activation Fund (LIHAF) for Mungret and was successful in March 2017. The

Government announced €10.5 million in funding for roads infrastructure to

allow for the development of new homes.

The LIHAF infrastructure will ensure the delivery of approximately 800

residential units on 25 hectares (62 acres approx.) of land owned by Limerick

City and County Council, with 250 of these units required to be completed by

2021 and a further 200 homes to be delivered on privately owned lands by

2021, under the terms of the LIHAF agreement. The remaining number of

units (approximately 350 no. new homes) will be delivered in a balanced

incremental manner by 2030.

**13.**

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, with regard to the scaling up of the Compulsory Purchase***

***Order (CPO) programmes in each local authority, and which has been sanctioned as a safe***

***way to proceed by the Attorney General, (a) How many CPO orders on vacant dwellings***

***have been issued by the Council in the past 2 years; (b) How many of these orders have***

***reached a successful conclusion; (c) What budget has been allocated by this Council to***

***secure vacant dwellings using the CPO method; and (d) When did this Council first use this***

***method with regard to vacant houses.***

**REPLY:**

No CPO acquisitions of vacant dwellings were carried out over the last two

years. There have been 3 dwellings successfully acquired using CPO

powers under Derelict Sites legislation over the last few years.
---
13

No

specific

budget has

been allocated

by

the Department

of

Housing, Planning and Local Government in this regard. However, from 2nd

October, 2017, Limerick City and County Council will establish an "Urban and

Village Renewal Department" to provide an enhanced response to dealing

with vacant sites/property, derelict sites and delivering public realm

improvement. Also, a Derelict Sites Action Plan, to work in tandem with a

Vacant Homes Action Plan, will be developed as part of an ongoing and

increased focus on addressing dereliction. The preferred method of

acquisition will be via agreement where possible but, where it is appropriate,

the Council will use its full range of statutory powers, including CPO

powers, to meet its objectives.

In relation to budgets, the cost of all approved housing acquisitions is

recouped under the Housing Capital Programme from central government.

Budgetary requirements will be dealt with as part of the normal Budget

procedure for 2018. The setting up of the new "Urban and Village Renewal

Department” shows Limerick’s commitment to this area.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Government put in place one Agency with full***

***responsibility for the maintenance / repair/ upkeep of all our rivers and streams.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin noted that two of the three arches under

the bridge at Athea were blocked and, as a result, there was a danger that the playing pitch

at the adjacent school would be washed away. He sought clarity as to who was responsible

for the maintenance of the river at this location and requested that the Council contact the

Office of Public Works in relation to the works required to alleviate this problem, and that a

Special Meeting should be held in Athea to discuss same.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

Members supported the Motion and highlighted the danger of flooding in parts of

Athea and the significant fundraising that had taken place to develop the school pitch.

Members also noted that, in the past, locals removed the silt from the river at this location

to alleviate the issue and should not now be stopped from doing same.

Councillor Costelloe reminded Members of the two lives that had been lost during

recent works at Thomond Bridge and proposed that a simple stone be erected in their

memory. This was seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

It was agreed that Councillor Galvin’s Motion would be circulated to all Local

Authorities for support.
---

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on An Taoiseach,***

***Mr. Leo Varadkar, T.D., to create a Minister for Social Enterprise to support and advance***

***this ever-evolving sector.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehy stressed the importance of social

enterprise in terms of economic potential, employment, social inclusion and shared

community spirit and noted the lack of proper structure for this sector and the level of

bureaucracy it had to deal with.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

Members supported the Motion and noted that this sector added value to the rural

economy and represented the way forward for rural Limerick.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Minister for Transport to***

***address the astronomical rise in car insurance.***

In proposing the Motion, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that the cost of car insurance

represented the major outlay for many young people and was an unfair burden, given the

reliance on the car and limited public transport. He called for regulation of the insurance

industry and for consideration to be given to a national insurance company.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor McMahon.

Members supported the Motion and the following points were made by Members

during discussion on this Motion:

• While it was acknowledged that young people were perceived as high risk from a car

insurance viewpoint, there should be a focus on altering driver behaviour using

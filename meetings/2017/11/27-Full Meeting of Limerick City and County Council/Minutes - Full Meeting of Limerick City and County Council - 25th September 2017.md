 2,045 units required by 2021 under the new Social Housing Programme

• 41 new-build were approved for delivery and underway to provide 645 units.

Potential to accelerate delivery.

• 19 new schemes were under preparation to seek Departmental approval to

proceed to commence the development process, to deliver 221 units. Approval

expected in Quarter 4, 2017. Potential to accelerate delivery.

• 7 sites for re-zoning initially identified in Limerick City to deliver 80 units. Further

sites would be investigated. Anticipated Variation date: Quarter 2, 2018.

housing units (270 Mungret, 155 Greenpark).

• 125 units committed under Part V.

• Next steps – identify public land for re-zoning, public land for private contractor

In conclusion, the A/Director said the success of the Rebuilding Ireland Programme

was dependent on continued support and commitment by the Department of Housing,

Planning and Local Government, the Elected Members and the general public. She added

that the Council’s objective to provide much needed housing accommodation must be

balanced with the policy objective to create safe and sustainable communities. This was

now achievable but needed continued ongoing commitment.

Some Members were of the view that this important issue required time for

discussion and debate and that the remaining items on the agenda should be deferred to

another day. Others Members were of the view that the Meeting should proceed with the

agenda as set out, particularly as there was a deadline of 30th September for a decision on

the Local Property Tax.

Following some further discussion, Councillor O’Hanlon proposed proceeding with

the business as set out on the agenda and that a Special Meeting would be convened to

discuss the Housing Action Plan. This was seconded by Councillor Crowley. In the absence

of agreement, the Mayor directed that a vote be take on the proposal. The result of the

voting was as follows:

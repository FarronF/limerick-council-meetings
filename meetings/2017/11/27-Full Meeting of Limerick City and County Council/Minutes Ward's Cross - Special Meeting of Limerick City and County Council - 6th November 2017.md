Councillor Galvin, at the outset, asked why representatives from Transport

Infrastructure Ireland (TII) were not in attendance at the Meeting. He stated that there

were 7 junctions between Newcastle West and the Kerry border that had stacking lanes

which allowed cars to cross safely. He added that there were 17 junctions, including Ward’s

Cross just outside Abbeyfeale, which were without these stacking lanes. He confirmed that

he had received correspondence from Deputy Neville that morning which had attached

letter received from TII. He read the following paragraph into the record of the Meeting

from the letter that had been received from TII:

*“Ward’s Cross Junction on the N21 was not identified in the 2014-2016 analysis, nor*

*does there appear to be any history of rear-end collisions at this location. In this*

*regard, it should be noted that the sight distance issue at the junction was addressed*

*a number of years ago.”*

Councillor Galvin asked for a programme of works to be drawn up which would

include a plan to install stacking lanes at 17 junctions concerned, with Ward’s Cross as a

priority location.

A number of Members spoke in support of Councillor Galvin and reiterated the

necessity to install stacking lanes. Some of the Members also made reference to other

junctions on the N21 which needed to be looked at.

In response, the Director, Physical Development, informed the Members that the

Council had invited representatives from TII to the Meeting. He added that it was not their

policy to attend Council Meetings and that instead they relied on officials of the Council to

act as a conduit in referring matters to them as appropriate. He went on to state that

Transport Infrastructure Ireland TII monitored safety on the roads network in order to

reduce risk and that it was also a priority for the Council, as a Roads Authority. He made

reference to a number of minor improvement schemes that had been undertaken by the

Council in response to local requests.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Galvin, it was

agreed to write to TII to ascertain what information they had in relation to Ward’s Cross to

include statistics on accidents.

On the proposal of Councillor Galvin, seconded by Councillor Browne, it was agreed

to write to An Garda Síochána in order to ascertain what reports they had submitted to TII

in relation to Ward’s Cross.---

The Director, Physical Development, addressed the Meeting again and stressed that

the Council had a very good relationship with TII and that they were responsive to requests

submitted to them by the Council. He confirmed that the Council would prepare a report on

the 17 junctions referred to earlier in the Meeting by Councillor Galvin and would include in

this report technical information, safety data, costings, etc. in relation to including stacking

lanes. An update would be given to the relevant Municipal District Meeting in December.

Following completion and approval by the Council, this report would be submitted to TII for

consideration. The Chief Executive indicated that he was in agreement with this approach

to the issue.

The A/Senior Engineer, Operations and Maintenance Services, confirmed that all

issues raised by the Members had been discussed with TII. He added that the TII

representative had agreed to check the accident history at Ward’s Cross.

This concluded the Meeting.

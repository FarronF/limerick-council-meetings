Circulated, report of the Acting Director, Service Operations setting out the intention to bring

the disposal of land at 16-19 Henry Street (The Gardens International Site) to Limerick Twenty

Thirty Strategic Development Designated Activity Company in the consideration of €1,323,439

**Customer Services, Culture and Arts Directorate**

**GMA Festivals and Events Grant Scheme**

Circulated, report of the Mayor of the Metropolitan District of Limerick dated 12th July, 2017

setting out the recommendations of the assessment panel for the allocation of funds under the

Metropolitan District’s GMA Festivals and Events Grants Scheme 2017. It was noted that

procedures regarding conflicts of interest had been in place during the assessment.

Members noted the potential economic benefit of festivals to the city and the region and

stressed the importance of ensuring that the financial support being given by the Council

on how existing festivals and events could be improved or expanded and that there was a

general national trend towards the increased private sponsorship of events and festivals.

In response to issues raised, the Director, Customer Services, Culture and Arts noted that

funding was being provided to EVA to facilitate it to increase its levels of inclusiveness and

engagement with the public and that an assessment of the impact of the funding provided

**Part 8 Procedure – Palm Court, Southill**

Circulated, report of the Deputy Chief Executive dated 7th July, 2017 enclosing Chief Executive's

Report setting out proposals for the construction of 27 new residential units at Palm Court,

Keyes Park, Southill that had been prepared in accordance with Section 179(3)(a) of the Planning

and Development Act, 2000 (as amended) and Part VIII of the Planning and Development

Regulations, 2001 (as amended) and proposed to proceed as indicated in Section 5 of the report.

Members welcomed the proposed development and acknowledged the consultation that had

taken place with regard to same and the fact that the residents views had been taken on board.

**(b)**

**Part 8 Procedure – Cliona Park, Moyross**

Circulated, report of the Deputy Chief Executive dated 7th July, 2017 enclosing Chief Executive's

Report setting out proposals for the construction of 18 new residential units at Cliona Park,

---
4

Development Act, 2000 (as amended) and Part VIII of the Planning and Development

Regulations, 2001 (as amended) and proposed to proceed as indicated in Section 5 of the report.

Members welcomed the proposed development and requested that they be kept informed of

similar Part VIII proposals from the time of site investigation so that queries from the public

could be dealt with in an informed manner.

The Senior Architect informed the Members that it was anticipated that both developments

would be delivered in 2019.

It was agreed that item 15 on the agenda would be taken next.

**15.**

**Presentation from SIRO**

The Mayor welcomed Mr. Stephen O’Connor, SIRO (a joint venture between the ESB and

Vodafone) to the meeting.

Mr. O’Connor presented SIRO’s plans to install a high speed, wholesale broadband network at

locations throughout Limerick availing of the ESB’s existing infrastructure. The network would

provide speeds of up to 1 GB/sec to homes and businesses and would be available to a range of

service providers.

In response to queries from Members, Mr. O’Connor noted that SIRO planned to spend €50m in

providing a high quality product in Limerick that would benefit the citizens of Limerick and had

been anxious to bring this fact to the attention of the Members. He pointed out that the project

was a commercial enterprise and not a Government initiative and the availability of an existing

ducting infrastructure would form an important part of the business case in deciding where the

service would be provided.

**QUESTIONS**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the status of the refurbishment of the vacant***

***housing units in the three storey block at Bourke Avenue for which design work commenced***

***last year?***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council have submitted a cost plan for the

refurbishment of 12 units on Bourke Avenue to the Department of Housing,

Planning, Community and Local Government on the 26 May 2017 and are

awaiting decision.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting why there has been so few meetings of the Horse Control***

***Committee, and when is it envisaged that this committee will begin to meet regularly, the***

***current spend so far this year on horse control, the number of horses seized, the number***

***reclaimed, and the number put down.***
---
5

**REPLY**:

Horse Control Statistics 1st January 2017 to 10th July 2017

Horses seized:

74

Horses released to owners:

4

Horses rehomed:

9

Horses euthanized as per bye-laws: 60

In pound at 10/07/2017

1

Expenditure on Horse Control to 1st January 2017 to 10th July 2017: €89,327.14

**REPLY**:

The Council established a control of horses working group to consider the

ongoing matters in relation to horse control and in particular the urban horse

issue. The working group comprises a small number of Elected Members and

staff. A particular focus of the group is examining the feasibility of establishing a

horse project in the Limerick City area. This was on foot of the possibility of

obtaining funding for same from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the

Marine. A number of other local authorities were also considering the possibility

of such a project. As a result, the Council organised a visit to an existing horse

project in Tralee and this took place on the 13th March 2017.

On foot of this successful visit it was planned to carry out a further site visit to the

Clondalkin Equine Club and the Dunsink Horse Club shortly thereafter.

Unfortunately due to the unavailability of Elected Members on the proposed

date it was agreed to defer the second visit until later in the year. The Council will

work with Members to select a suitable date to visit the Dublin projects and the

working group can meet as required.

So far in 2017, 74 horses have been seized of which 4 were recovered by the

owners, 9 were re-homed, and 60 were euthanised. One horse was in the pound

on the instant date of this reply. Expenditure to date in 2017 is €90,000. It should

be borne in mind that this service is demand driven and this influences the cost

to the Council.

The Council continues to raise the various issues pertaining to the operation of

the control of horses legislation at a national level. At a local level revised bye-

laws aimed at prohibiting sulky racing have been drafted and have been

advertised for public consultation.

A report on the submissions received will be prepared for consideration by the

Environmental Strategic Policy Committee at an early date for onward reference

to the Full Council.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting when the Council decided to go to Part 8 with the Opera Centre***

***Site, when the plans were finalised, when internal briefings occurred, who made the decision***

***to give Councillors just 2 days notice to become available for the briefing and will there be***

***another briefing organised for Councillors with adequate notice to be given.***

**REPLY**:

The Council in May 2016 requested Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development
---
6

DAC (then LCO Enterprise Development Company) to prepare design frameworks

for each of the strategic sites identified in Limerick 2030. The purpose of the

design frameworks is to identify the optimum use mix and key urban design

principles that should apply to their development and to examine the business

case for their development.

The Opera Site was the first such site to be examined by Limerick 2030. Limerick

2030 DAC has completed a full development appraisal of the site and prepared a

comprehensive master plan for its development based on generating an

economic and social return for Limerick.

The revised master plan was approved by the board of Limerick 2030 in

December 2016 and the proposal to use the Part 8 process was identified as a

means of progressing the development to the next stage. Detailed design work on

the planning application has taken place since February with a target date of June

30th for the submission of the application agreed with the Chief Executive. These

plans were finalised in June of this year by the board of Limerick 2030 who

requested that a briefing be arranged for Councillors. This briefing was arranged

once all documentation for the submission of the planning application was

completed which unfortunately resulted in the short notice being given.

All Councillors were provided with the press release in advance of its publication

and provided with copies of the briefing given on the 30th of June. Limerick 2030

DAC have offered to make themselves available to Councillors should they require

additional information. It is intended that prior to completion of the public

consultation phase that a further briefing will be given to Councillors on all

submissions received prior to the meeting of the Metropolitan District to decide

on the application.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**8.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan**

***I will move at the next meeting that this District supports the drinks industry and hospitality***

***sector which supports 6,997 jobs in Limerick and is a critical component of our offering to***

***tourists, with tourism spend in Limerick worth €271 million in 2016. This District backs the***

***‘Support Your Local’ campaign in calling for a reduction in excise tax on alcohol in budget***

***2018, in order to support local jobs, the hospitality sector and our local economy.***

It was agreed that this motion would be withdrawn.

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council examine the feasibility of hiring a Traffic***

***Engineer so that as an authority we can better manage our traffic and develop our own traffic***

***management plans, in house.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.
---
7

In proposing the motion, Councillor Butler noted the increased traffic that would be generated

in the Raheen / Dooradoyle area with the opening of new schools and in excess of 200 new

houses proposed. He noted the ongoing requirement to engage traffic consultants and resultant

delays caused by the tendering process and the benefit additional in house expertise would

contribute through the maintenance of existing, and the development of new, traffic

management plans.

**REPLY:**

The Council continually reviews its staffing and human resource requirements to

respond to its business objectives in accordance with the Council’s Corporate

Plan. The economic recovery has led to increased traffic volumes which are

particularly prevalent in urban areas and especially so in the city area.

The Physical Development Directorate is progressing a number of transportation

schemes across Limerick with a view to improving management of these

increased traffic volumes and is keeping Elected Members updated on same.

Traffic planning and management is a highly specialised skill set. These skills are

usually availed of by the Council through the procurement of consultant services

in relation to projects.

Separately the Council has a number of very experienced staff in its employment

with many years background in transportation and traffic management. Training

is provided to these staff in order to further develop their competencies.

The issue of adding further technical resources to the Council’s team will be kept

under review in the context of available resources and the additional demands

that the Council will face in the years ahead.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the importance of proper traffic management

as a selling point for the city and suggested that existing staff be brought to the required

qualification standard.

The Director, Physical Development pointed out that he was satisfied with existing resources in

this regard and noted the Members request for a single point of contact on these issues.

On the proposal of Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, seconded by Councillor Costelloe, it was agreed that

standing orders would be suspended to allow for the completion of the agenda.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council install some form of crossing between Cruises***

***Street and the Urban Garden, O'Connell Street as has been discussed on many previous***

***occasions.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

**REPLY**:

The Urban Garden was created to enhance the experience of the city centre and

contains a number of food and drink retail units and is generally seen as a very

positive asset.
---
8

Limerick City and County Council has made provision for regulated pedestrian

crossing facilities to be provided at this location as part of the improvements to

O’Connell Street. It should be borne in mind that there are existing controlled

pedestrian crossings at Denmark Street and Sarsfield Street/William Street.

Consideration will be given to extending the planters at the garden to restrict

pedestrians crossing.

Members expressed opposing views on this motion with some noting that pedestrians were

choosing to cross at this location as there was a logical flow of pedestrian traffic from Cruises

Street across to the Urban Garden and Penneys and the crossing should be acknowledged and

made safe. Other Members pointed out that there were a number of alternative official

crossings nearby that could be availed of by pedestrians and the potential to cross at this point

should be removed.

The Meetings Administrator undertook to bring Members views to the attention of the

Executive.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh** **(to be referred to the Joint**

**Policing Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick host a family-***

***friendly, public bonfire night to alleviate pressure on Gardaí and the Fire Services and to curb***

***illegal burning of rubbish and the damaging of green areas.***

It was agreed that this motion should be sent to the Joint Policing Committee for consideration.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council erect a memorial plaque, in remembrance of***

***Bryan Whelan and T. J Herlihy, who died tragically while restoring Thomond Bridge on the***

***29th of August 2015.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Costelloe and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

Members acknowledged the sensitivity associated with this motion and the other deaths that

were associated with this location and the need to consult with the different families involved.

Members discussed the most appropriate location for a memorial and whether a separate

memorial should be erected for those who had lost their lives while working on behalf of the

Council. The Director, Physical Development indicated that further discussion on this matter

should be held after the meeting.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan**

***I will call at the next meeting for the Council to remove the bus lane on Ballinacurra. It has***

***made driving on Ballinacurra very dangerous. Residents of the area are complaining about the***

***fact that is virtually impossible to reverse their cars into their gardens. Also residents on***

***Lifford Avenue and Omega Avenue find it extremely difficult and dangerous to access***

***Ballinacurra with taxis and buses driving extremely quickly on the bus lane.***
---
9

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hogan and seconded by Councillor Crowley.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hogan highlighted the difficulties of residents on the left

hand side of the Ballinacurra Road, exiting the city, in accessing and exiting their property by car

as this operation generally involved blocking traffic on the busy Ballinacurra Road. Similarly she

noted that residents on the opposite side of the road had to carry out similar manoeuvres across

the bus lane with many residents now choosing to park on Lifford Avenue giving rise to capacity

issues there, with others using it as a park and ride location.

**REPLY**:

The improvements on the Ballinacurra Road were completed a number of years

ago. The project was funded entirely by the National Transport Authority and

could only be delivered where there was a gain for public transport in accordance

with Government policy. As with any major transport project the Council

continues to monitor the effectiveness of the scheme. Based on the observations

of the Council the scheme has delivered on its primary objectives, which was the

improvement of public transport.

As part of the delivery of the project there was considerable public engagement

with residents at an individual and collective level. The outcome of this

engagement led to amendments in the delivery of the scheme to accommodate

the needs of the households on the Ballinacurra Road. One of the key

requirements was facilitating ease of access to off-street parking.

The scheme was designed in accordance with national guidelines with a view to

limiting speeds. In response to submissions received from the residents a “driver

feedback sign” was installed on the Ballinacurra Road recently. This sign advises

motorists of their speed and these signs have been proven effective in terms of

speed control.

However, enforcement of speed control is a matter for An Garda Siochana and

this issue can be referred to the Joint Policing Committee with a request for an

increased presence of speed enforcement on the Ballinacurra Road.

Members noted an issue at the end of the bus lane and requested accident statistics for that

location. Members noted the important part played by bus lanes in the overall transport

strategy and highlighted the extent of the consultation and negotiation that had taken place

over a number of years leading up to the installation of this bus lane. It was suggested that the

bus lane operate, as such, only during peak times.

The Director, Physical Development acknowledged the issues raised by the motion and noted

that the bus lane had been retro-fitted at this location and that driver courtesy was needed to

accommodate the residents.

**14.**

**Social Development Directorate**

**Community Facilities Scheme Applications for Approval**

Circulated, report of the Chief Officer, LCDC dated 12th July, 2017 setting out the

recommendations of the LCDC on the allocation of funding under the Communities Facilities
---
10

Grant Scheme, 2017. It was noted that the guidelines for the scheme specified that the funding

related to capital projects only.

It was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, that the proposed

allocation of €1,000 to Limerick Belles for Shower System be amended to €500 for equipment as

a grant towards fixtures might not be appropriate for this group as they did not own the

property involved. It was agreed that the remaining €500 be awarded to Monaleen Park

Residents Association for equipment, in the interest of geographical balance.

It was proposed by Councillor O’Dea, seconded by Councillor Daly, that those applicants that had

been unsuccessful should be written to and the reasons for same outlined.

Proposed by Councillor O’Dea;

Seconded by Councillor Crowley;

And Resolved:

QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

| will ask at the next meeting if the Council has had any further talks with the owners of
Parkway Valley site at the Dublin Road over its dereliction and future development.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

| will ask at the next meeting if the Council has reviewed its social housing units to ensure
that all safety measures are fully functional and in place, such as early warning systems,
including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways

etc.

Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller

| will ask at the next meeting, in relation to air quality monitoring and in the event of a
breach in the recommended air quality guidelines (especially at the Irish Cement, Mungret
monitor),

What plan or action is activated, to counteract the breach, especially in relation to the
more serious "Suspend" particulates, PM10 / PM2.5 / PM1; How often is the information
collected or monitored, and by whom; Do the monitors themselves need servicing, if so,
how often; Is it possible to install an additional monitor in close proximity to the children's
playground and school in Mungret College.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

| will ask at the next meeting for an update on the discussions with Bus Eireann and the
NTA about organising a ‘Car Free City’ day or weekend with free public transport. This was
proposed at the February Metropolitan meeting, and unanimously endorsed at the SPC
level, but we have not heard any more. It is probably too late for this years European Week
which is now upon us, but should be pursued for next years at least.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

| will ask at the next meeting for an update on my motion from the April Metropolitan
meeting to amend our development plan to ban incineration, gasification, fracking, etc.
This was sent to the Economic and Development SPC but that seems to have scheduled no
meetings for May, June, July, August or September.

Disposal of Land

Circulated, copy of Statutory Notice dated 12th July, 2017, together with report from

the Head of Property Services dated 12th July, 2017, in relation to proposal for the disposal

of land at 16-19 Henry Street, Limerick, (Gardens International Site) to Limerick Twenty

Thirty Strategic Development Designated Activity Company.

The report stated that a resolution in relation to the disposal of this property had

already been passed by the Council in March 2016 and, if the present proposal was

approved, the resolution would supersede the previous resolution passed in March 2016.

The report went on to say that the decision to sell this land at cost was in line with

International Accounting Standards 40 which set out that an asset should be held at cost or

fair value – therefore, the decision was to dispose of the asset to Limerick Twenty Thirty

Strategic Development DAC at the cost price of €1,323,439, plus VAT. The Gardens

International Project would provide 80,000 sq. ft. of high performance Grade A office

accommodation over 6 floors and would be the first LEED Gold Office development in

Limerick City Centre. It would set new standards of design and energy efficiency, combining

modern architecture and heritage buildings that would set the standard for new

developments in Limerick.

The A/Head of Finance noted that the disposal value reflected the purchase price of

the property, plus the value of enabling works. He pointed out that the Board of Limerick

Twenty Thirty Strategic Development Designated Activity Company would make future

decision in relation to the property but pointed out that this company was a 100%

subsidiary of the Council.

Members welcomed the development of the Gardens International Site and noted

the potential of the development to set the market value of office accommodation in the

City, act as a catalyst for further similar development and accommodate up to 700 jobs in

the future.

In reply to issues raised by Members, the Chief Executive noted that Elected

Members formed the majority of the Board of Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic

Development Designated Activity Company. He pointed out that the Board was qualified to

carry out its functions and that a business case was prepared for each project considered.

He stated that the value of the assets of the company accrued to the Council as the

shareholder, and that the Elected Council had control of borrowing. In addition, extensive

due diligence was carried out by the Banks that funded the borrowing and the company’s

activities were subject to review by the Local Government Auditor. With regard to keeping

Members appraised of the company’s activities, he pointed out that same would be

included in the Chief Executive’s monthly report to Members.

Proposed by Councillor Collins (J);

Seconded by Councillor Browne;

And Resolved:---

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the disposal of 0.2478

hectares of land situated at 16-19, Henry Street, Limerick City (The Gardens International

Site), to Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development Designated Activity Company (this

company being wholly owned by Limerick City and County Council) for the sum of

€1,323,439, plus VAT, particulars of which were contained in Statutory Notice dated 12th

July, 2017. This resolution supersedes previous resolution passed at Council Meeting held

on 23rd March, 2016, which approved the disposal of this land to LCO Local Enterprise

Development Company Limited (now Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development

Designated Activity Company) for the nominal sum of €1.”

Members congratulated the Deputation on their presentation and the following

points were made by Members during discussion of this item:

• The introduction of a student loan scheme would result in increased student emigration,

post college.

• Supports for apprenticeships had been withdrawn from small-scale employers over the

past 10 years and this should be addressed.

• The extent of students who did not qualify for a state grant but could not afford to

attend third level should be established.

• Colleges should play a more active role in providing student accommodation.

• Employers should support the cost of third level education to a greater extent.

In response to issues raised by Members, the Deputation clarified the following:

• In the UK, only 50% of the cost of their student loan scheme was being recovered from

the students.

• The ongoing cost of education was acknowledged and it was known that many students

had dropped out of college having failed to secure a student grant.

• With regard to the cost of accommodation, the Union of Students in Ireland had

campaigned for increased adjacency rates. In many instances, students were paying

commuting costs similar to accommodation costs.

The Mayor thanked the Deputation for their presentation and advised that the

Deputation should contact the Members further with regard to any related Motion that

should go forward to the next Meeting. The Deputation then withdrew.---

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Local Authority oppose any attempt to re-route***

***the proposed motorway link between Cork and Limerick through Tipperary, further***

***isolating West Limerick.***

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt

with:

12.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many people have approached Limerick City and County***

***Council in relation to the Council purchasing their houses, how many of these houses were***

***vacant, and how many were purchased for years 2015, 2016, and 2017 to date.***

**REPLY:**

Data on the submission of expressions of interest for the potential acquisition

of residential property from June 2015 shows that expressions of interest

related to a total of 459 residential properties have been submitted to date.

From May 2016, Limerick City and County Council’s approach has been to

only target residential property for acquisition which is currently vacant or

owner-occupied where the purchase will not result in a housing need.

Of the 459 residential properties submitted, 234 were vacant or owner-

occupied. 86 residential properties have been purchased from 2015 to date

for general housing stock, 26 are currently at ‘sale agreed’ stage. These

acquisitions exclude residential property purchased under the Regeneration

Programme.

Limerick City and County Council is actively seeking vacant residential

properties for acquisition and leasing under the ‘Buy and Renew’ and ‘Repair

and Lease’ schemes launched as part of *Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for*

*Housing and Homelessness.*---

13.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will ask at the next Meeting is the Council still employing AWL Consulting to assist with***

***making a submission to the Environmental Protection Agency regarding Irish Cement’s***

***plans for their Dock Road plant.***

**REPLY:**

In November 2016, the Council tendered for consultancy services in respect

of planning application ref 16/345 by Irish Cement. AWN’s tender was

deemed the most economically advantageous and the company was duly

awarded the contract. AWN submitted their report on 19th Dec 2016.

Based on this report Irish Cement was requested to submit further

information in respect of their planning application. This information was

received in February 2017. AWN’s contract was extended to include the

review of this information. This review was completed on 22nd Feb 2017.

Following this, AWN’s Dr Edward Porter attended a meeting of the

Metropolitan District on 20th March 2017 to give a presentation on Irish

Cement’s proposals and to answer the Councillors queries. This completed

the work which AWN had been contracted to do for the Council.

There is currently no contract for further consultancy services with respect to

the Irish Cement's planning or licence applications in place.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many social houses will be provided in Limerick this***

***year under the Buy and Renew Scheme and Lease and Repair Scheme to bring vacant***

***houses back into use.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council recognise the opportunity provided by both

the Buy and Renew Scheme and the Repair and Lease Scheme to reduce the

level of vacancy in Limerick. Information on both these schemes has been

promoted by Limerick City and County Council in the media, most recently

with advertisements placed in local newspapers in June, see attached. The

NOTICES OF MOTION

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Local Authority call on the Gaelic Athletic***

***Association to halt the current practice of allowing SKY TV exclusive rights to screen***

***particular Gaelic Games fixtures. Instead, RTE, TV3 or TG4 should be allowed to also***

***screen these fixtures. Denying households who do not subscribe to SKY TV the right to***

***view our National Games is a travesty.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Sheahan

(J).

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin acknowledged that significant progress

had been made by the GAA in opening Croke Park to Rugby and holding the Junior and

Intermediate All-Ireland Finals there. He also acknowledged the role played by SKY in

bringing national games to an international audience but stressed that, for various reasons,

not all people in Ireland had access to SKY and therefore the GAA matches shown on SKY

should also be shown on free to air, national channels. He pointed out that the current

arrangement was encouraging young people to go to pubs to view matches and requested

that the Motion, if adopted, be circulated to all Local Authorities.

Members supported the Motion and noted that not all people could attend at games

and the television was their only way of viewing matches. Members noted that the GAA

was an integral part of Irish culture and accountable to its members and should make use of

its facilities as an alternative means of raising finance. Members discussed the funding of

the GAA, the role of inter-county players, the benefits of match broadcasting to the Irish

Diaspora and the option to have deferred showings of matches broadcast by SKY on free to

air, national channels.

It was agreed that the Motion would be circulated to all Local Authorities for

support.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on Transport***

***Infrastructure Ireland to attend a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council to***

***discuss the recommendations made by their Consultants, RPS, in relation*** ***to the Review of***

***Speed Limit Bye-Laws on the National Primary and National Secondary Roads in Limerick.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor

Crowley.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan (J) sought clarity on the brief that had

been given by the Council to RPS and whether RPS recommendations had to be accepted in

totality or whether Council Engineers could have counter proposals. He noted that in---
18

Newcastle West, speed limits were being moved in towards the town, in some instances

speed limits were being increased in locations where traffic calming measures were in place

and, on the Killarney Road from Abbeyfeale, there were three different speed limits over a

short distance.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Crowley noted that there was insufficient notice

to reduce speed approaching many towns and villages and raised an issue in relation to the

100 km/h speed limit on local roads and called for greater communication with the

Members.

Members supported the Motion, noted the ongoing difficulty in getting Transport

Infrastructure Ireland to attend at Council Meetings or Workshops and requested the

Executive to support the Motion.

proposal to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for more

producer responsibility in relation to disposable packaging/one use items developing a levy on

one use items along the lines of the successful plastic bag tax.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, it was agreed to take Item No. 11 Notice of Motion

Councillor J. Scanlan at this point in the Meeting.

NOTICE OF MOTION

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan**

***I will move at the next Meeting that an acceptable time frame be agreed to enable***

***prospective tenants take up residence upon local authority houses being allocated to them***

***within this Area.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that he was concerned at the delay from the

time a tenant vacates the property and a new tenant takes possession. It was also stated that

tenants did not get to see the property prior to allocation and in some instances work had not

been done to meet their needs.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

In replying the A/Senior Executive Officer, Community Support Services stated that in some

cases the tenants did get to see the property prior to works commencing. It was stated that

since 1st July, 2017 new minimum standards apply and that properties need to be brought up to

those standards prior to allocation.

He also stated that if any Members had individual concerns he would discuss these with them.

**REPLY:**

I refer to Limerick City and County Councils recent audit by NOAC where the

Councils average re-let period of vacant social housing units was confirmed as 17

weeks. Community Support Services works in tandem with our colleagues in

Operations and Maintenance to ensure that units are turned around and

allocated to applicants on the housing list as soon as possible. This allocation

period is based on the works required to the property further to national

minimum rental standards and also based on the condition the property has

been returned by the previous tenants.

There are a number of specific cases where allocations are made to prospective

tenants in advance of significant works being undertaken on the relevant

property. In all such cases the tenants are advised, at the outset, of the timeline

when the unit will be ready for occupation. Examples of such allocations would---
4

include situations where specific alterations are required to the dwelling to

accommodate medical needs of the applicant or a member of their family.

It should be noted however that in the vast majority of cases allocations of

Council properties are made to applicants on the housing list only where the unit

is available for immediate occupation.

**(c)Provision of a new Graveyard in Abbeyfeale**

The Senior Executive Engineer, gave an update on progress in relation to the provision of a new

graveyard in Abbeyfeale. He stated that of the 3 sites previously identified only one was now a

possibility. Members raised concern at the location of the site identified and the lack of parking

at this location. It was agreed to revert to Members once further testing and valuation of the

site was carried out.

**(d)Taking in charge of Estates**

The Senior Executive Engineer, circulated an updated report on the status of taking in charge of

estates in the District. Members raised queries in relation to some estates and it was agreed

that they would liaise directly with the Senior Executive Engineer in relation to specific queries.

**3.**

**Economic Development Directorate**

**Great Southern Greenway Limerick**

The Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development gave a presentation on Great Southern

Greenway Limerick and the proposed incorporation of the Barnagh Tunnel under the following

headings:

• Proposed Works Location.

• Scope of Works.

• Underpass.

• Underpass Location.

He stated that as the period for doing a Part VIII process had been reduced he would hope that

approval would be received by December, 2017 and works would commence early in 2018.

Members suggested that the old station house at Barnagh should be considered to lease or buy

and that this would be a valuable historical site on the Greenway.

The proposal was noted by the Members as outlined.

**4.Social Development Directorate**

The report went on to outline that the Communities Facilities Scheme guidelines specified that

the funding related to capital projects only and was intended to help grass roots community

projects get underway or take the next step towards completion. It stated that it was targeted at

disadvantaged urban and rural areas and that the scheme offered grants of a maximum €1,000.

The closing date for receipt of applications was 26th May 2017.

A subgroup of LCDC had evaluated 152 applications in total based on need, additionality,

government policy, impact and sustainability. In the interest of equity/fairness and the

desirability to achieve a geographical balance and to fund a variety of projects, a maximum limit

of two projects per organisation per electoral area had been applied.

The report stated that the Community Facilities Scheme guidelines specified that “the LCDC

makes a recommendation of ‘LCDC approved’ or ‘LCDC denied’ on each project and the project

with the LCDC recommendation will then be submitted to the Municipal District Committee

who will make the final decision on project approval taking into consideration the LCDC---
6

recommendation. A clear reasoning must be noted in the case where a project is approved or

denied at Municipal level which is contrary to the LCDC recommendation”.

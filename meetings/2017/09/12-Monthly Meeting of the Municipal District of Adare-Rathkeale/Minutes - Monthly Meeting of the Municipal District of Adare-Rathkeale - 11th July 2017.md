where it was proposed to install cameras in the towns of Foynes, Askeaton, Rathkeale, Adare

and Croom, within the District and noted that, while there were many risks within the project,

every effort would be made to stay on schedule.

In relation to Rathkeale Members stressed the need to monitor the main street and a view

was expressed that a camera at Cois Deel may not be warranted. It was noted that the Council

already had a number of cameras located in Rathkeale and that these should be taken into

consideration.

With regard to Askeaton Members noted the potential to locate a camera on the Square, west

of the bridge, and requested that this location be considered for any expansion of the scheme

in the future.

Members noted the proposed location of cameras at Adare and discussed the potential of

placing a camera on the Rathkeale Road at the junction to the Sports Centre. It was noted that

the existing communications infrastructure might limit such an option.

In relation to Croom, Members noted the potential to add cameras at two further locations in

the future.

The Head of Digital Strategy pointed out that the Gardaí had been consulted in relation to the

location of cameras and that multiple cameras could be positioned at single locations. He

noted that privacy issues had to be taken into consideration and that the standard of public

lighting, adjacent to camera locations, would be kept under review.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Ms. Michelle Horrigan to the Meeting. Ms. Horrigan circulated

and reviewed a document giving details of Askeaton Contemporary Arts, its marketing and

audience engagement strategy and associated aims.

Ms. Horrigan outlined details of Askeaton Contemporary Arts 12th Annual Festival and

highlighted the need for a permanent exhibition or gallery space in Askeaton, the benefits that

would be associated with same and the difficulty of attracting funding for such capital projects

from sources such as the Arts Council.

Members queried the type of property being considered and the projected cost of same. Ms.

Horrigan noted that a property with a downstairs exhibition area and upstairs residential

accommodation was sought and that suitable property had been identified in Askeaton with a

projected cost of €80,000 to €90,000.

Councillor Sheahan noted his support for Askeaton Contemporary Arts and stressed the

importance of necessary funding being sourced while suitable property was still available. He

sale, as discussed, proceed. Councillor O’Brien and McMahon expressed reservations that

Councillor Sheahan had proposed the purchase of a property in which he had a beneficial

interest.

Members discussed the options that might be available to Askeaton Contemporary Arts to

acquire a suitable property. The Arts Officer noted that the Council was looking at the spatial

needs for the arts throughout the administrative area and highlighted the need for an

appropriate business plan to be developed. She pointed out the lack of local or national

funding streams for capital investments of this nature and noted the potential of Creative

Europe as an option that should be explored.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Ms. Sinead McDonnell, Environment Awareness Officer to the

highlighted the extent of the TLC3 activities in which 16,779 volunteers had taken part and 68

tonnes of litter were collected and gave a breakdown of this waste, by type. The presentation

noted a range of solutions required from a variety of stakeholders and called for the

development of a policy in relation to the use of ‘one use items’. Details of the Limerick Going

for Gold Competition were also reviewed, including the new Love Your Limerick Photographic

Competition.

Members expressed concern at the extent of littering still taking place and made the following

points while discussing this item:-

• A deposit and return scheme should be introduced for glass and aluminium containers.

• The barcode on products found dumped should be used to trace the product back to

the purchaser.

• Bins should be provided at supermarkets and similar outlets where excess packaging

can be deposited.

• Litter picking by volunteers on national roads is limited by the risk involved and needs

to be addressed.

• It should be made clear to consumers that unwanted small electrical appliances can be

brought in to electrical distributors without a corresponding purchase.

• Consideration should be given to the development of a smart phone app. to identify

litter/dumping locations to the Council.

• Steps should be taken to ensure that food takeaway premises adhere to their licenced

opening hours

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the same level of street cleaning that was allocated to**

**Adare be extended to all towns within our Municipal District, in the interest of fairness.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey expressed disappointment that, in spite of having

made representations at all levels of the Executive and contributing General Municipal

Allocation (GMA) funding towards same in 2016, he had learned from a member of the public

that weekend street cleaning was to be restored to Adare. He noted that the shortfall in the

street cleaning budget was to be funded from the roads budget and pointed out that the Local

Property Tax (LPT) had been increased for this purpose.

Members supported the Motion and, while acknowledging constraints on the available

budget, called for a structured approach to street cleaning with available resources shared

between the towns in the District and suggested that this issue be discussed further by the

District when budget 2018 was under review.

Members highlighted the ongoing traffic hazards at this location and it was proposed by

Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue that Transport Infrastructure Ireland

(TII) be requested to monitor traffic movements during school opening/closing times or that

the Council should install cameras for this purpose and send the recordings to TII.

Infrastructure Ireland (TII) on Tuesday, 4th July to discuss Kilcornan Traffic

Calming Scheme. TII have queries on the design submitted. Central Services are

currently preparing a report addressing these queries which will be submitted to

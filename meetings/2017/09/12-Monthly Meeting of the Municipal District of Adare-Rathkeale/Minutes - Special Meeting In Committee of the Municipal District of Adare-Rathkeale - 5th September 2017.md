**Foul Sewer in Adare**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. John O’Shaughnessy and Jana Goold from Irish Water

to the Meeting.

Mr. O’Shaughnessy reviewed, with the aide of a presentation, Irish Water’s involvement

in proposals to extend a sewer line along a portion of the Rathkeale Road, exiting Adare.

He noted that a segment of this line could be used to service the Council lands in Adare

but that these lands could also be serviced by the lowering of the Deerpark pumping

station and this option would not require a pipe along the roadway. He stressed that

Irish Water’s role was to provide services in accordance with the requirements of the

customer and with the customer carrying the cost.

Members discussed the benefits and options for servicing the lands zoned as ‘residential

various phases’ on the other side of the road opposite the Council lands and it was

noted that a wayleave ran at the back of the existing houses at this location and that

another pumping station would probably be required to service this land, via any

network installed on the Council lands, and a more extensive survey in this regard would

be required. Members stressed the need for serviced sites and housing to

accommodate the needs of young people from Adare and it was noted that, in addition

to the social housing proposed for the Council lands, there was potential for in excess of

200 private residential units at that location.

The Director, Regional Services pointed out that the issue being brought before the

Members in relation to the approved overlay works and the implications of laying an

adjacent sewer line were whether the Council should; do nothing; lay the sewer line

along the full length of the overlay works during which traffic through Adare would be

diverted due to the extent of rock to be excavated or; lay the sewer line along the road

up to the Council lands with single lane closure; or explore the alternative options to

service the Council lands and if that alternative was deemed more favourable proceed

accordingly and let the overlay works proceed. She pointed out that any option chosen

to service the Council lands would have to be marketable.

A Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Teskey that the

Council should make affordable sites available in Adare to people from Adare.

The Director, Regional Services noted that the disposal of land was a matter for the

elected Council to decide and that a policy in this regard should be considered by the

Home and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee (SPC).

Members noted the position in relation to the extent of hard rock and the related

requirement for full width road closure in Adare and accepted that the provision of a

sewer along the N21 at this point in time was not recommended. Following discussion it

was agreed that the Council would proceed and work with Irish Water to ascertain the

most suitable route for servicing the Council lands in Adare and once determined the

Council would proceed with the overlay project, subject to Transport Infrastructure

Ireland (TII) approval. Members requested to be kept informed of developments in this

regard.

This concluded the Meeting.

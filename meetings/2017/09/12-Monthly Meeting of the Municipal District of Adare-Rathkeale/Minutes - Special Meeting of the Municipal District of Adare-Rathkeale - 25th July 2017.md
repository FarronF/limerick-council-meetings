**Policing Issues**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Tom O’Connor to the Meeting. The

Superintendent reviewed the crime figures for the first six months of 2017 compared to the

same period in 2016 under a range of headings.

Members thanked the Superintendent for his presentation and raised the following points in

relation to crime prevention and detection in the District:-

• The apparent dealing of drugs by travelling gangs to disaffected young men in the

Kildimo/Pallaskenry area and the need for a guiding hand to be given to these young

men and the drug dealing eliminated.

• The large number of quad bikes that were being stolen.

• The extent of unreported crime and fear prevalent in Askeaton, along with the extent

of break-ins and the apparent dealing of drugs in up to eight locations in Askeaton. The

fact that the Garda Station in Askeaton was no longer in operation 24 hours per day

was noted.

• The importance of an increased Garda presence during the Christmas period in

Rathkeale and the need for more Gardaí on the beat throughout the District.

• The potential for criminals to become aware of the extent of Gardaí on duty in the

District at any particular time and the need for the Gardaí to take steps to prevent

same.

• The backlog in recruitment and loss of experience since the suspension of Garda

recruitment and the age of the equipment being provided to the Gardaí in the District.

• The positive contribution the Gardaí had made to the Foynes Air Show.

The Superintendent clarified the following in response to queries that had been raised by

Members:

• Planning for Christmas in Rathkeale had commenced in April and the Gardaí had

engaged with the Facilitator.

• Response time was an ongoing issue as any accident involving injury could take a

number of hours to deal with.

• The Garda district was continuously looking for additional resources and it could take a

number of years before Gardaí numbers were restored.

• In relation to licence plate recognition technology, new palm top technology would

assist in this regard.

• A new public order vehicle was awaited and in rural areas it was almost inevitable that

locals would establish the working patterns of the local Gardaí.

• The Gardaí were involved in discussions regarding the appropriate citing of CCTV

cameras under the County Wide CCTV programme and while it was understood that

there would be a limit on the number of CCTV cameras initially installed, it was hoped

that these numbers would increase in time. The Gardaí would have 24 hour access to

the CCTV cameras.

Members noted the impending retirement of Superintendent O’Connor and commended him

on his knowledge of the area and its people. Members noted the extent of the area the

Superintendent was responsible for, commended him for his accessibility, helpfulness and

diligence and wished him well for the future.

The Superintendent thanked the Members for their good wishes and assured them that there

would be a comprehensive hand over process with his replacement.

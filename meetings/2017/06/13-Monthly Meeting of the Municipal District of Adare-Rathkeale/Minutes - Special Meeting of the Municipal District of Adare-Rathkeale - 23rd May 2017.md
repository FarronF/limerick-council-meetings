**Facilitators Report on Christmas in Rathkeale with the Facilitator**

The Draft Report of the Independent Facilitator on meetings with various stakeholders in

Rathkeale dated 5th May, 2017 was circulated to Members.

The Members welcomed the Independent Facilitator Seán Ó Riordán who had prepared

the report.

The various sections of the report were considered by the Members who raised

additional items/issues for inclusion as part of the report.

It was requested that the Independent Facilitator would take these additional items on

board and revise the report where necessary.

The Director, Regional Services pointed out that the report would also be considered by

the Management Team. The revised report should then be brought back to the

Members for further consideration.

At the conclusion of the Agenda Members expressed disappointment at the manner in

which a member of the local Rathkeale Boxing Club, Martin Keenan, was omitted from

the Irish Boxing Squad, even though Mr. Keenan was the National Elite 91+KG champion.

Members requested the Meeting Administrator to convey their disappointment at this

decision to the Irish Athletic Boxing Association (IABA) and agreed a Notice of Motion
---
calling on the IABA to re-examine the position and provide for a box-off to decide the

national representative in this case.

This concluded the Meeting.

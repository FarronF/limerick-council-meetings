**Deputation from Croom Development Association**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Padraig Broderick, Mr. Tom Shanahan, Chairperson of the

Croom Traders Association and Ms. Elaine Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Croom

Development.

The Deputation noted that, while there were many positive developments associated with

Croom, many businesses had closed in the past number of years leaving a large amount of

vacant property, a portion of which was derelict and revitalisation of this aspect of the Town

was necessary.

The Deputation highlighted the issue of traffic congestion on the main street and presented a

solution to same which would involve the acquisition and demolition of three adjacent

properties, the construction of a 40 space, off street, car park and the limiting of parking to

one side of the main street.

Members thanked the Deputation for their presentation and made the following point in

relation to same:-

• The proposed site had a history of illegal fly tipping and the proposal would help to

resolve same.

• The introduction of one way traffic on the main street should be considered.

• The Renovation and Refurbishment Scheme should be considered with regard to some

of the vacant property and the owners approached in this regard.

• Consideration should be given to engaging the services of a town planner to review

how best to approach the issues faced by the town.

• The ongoing status of the private road, included in the presented proposals, should be

clarified.

• Traffic congestion on the main street was hindering existing businesses and

discouraging new business from setting up and the proposals would assist in resolving

this issue.

• The cooperation of business and property owners in Croom should be sought to assist

in moving the proposals forward.

The Cathaoirleach thanked the Deputation for their input and requested that they keep the

District Members informed of progress within the coming months.

Members noted proposals in relation to the sewer and discussed the potential to carry out

works to the proposed carpark and storm water attenuation at that time in order to avoid

increased traffic congestion at a later date.

In response to issues raised by Members the Director, Regional Services noted that she could

not give assurances that funding would not be in jeopardy due to delays and pointed out that

expenditure on a ground condition survey and detailed design in association with the

proposed sewer had been necessary as same had not been carried out in association with a

related third party planning application. She informed the Members that the survey had

identified the presence of a significant amount of rock along the route of the proposed sewer.

landowners informing them to cut their hedging. This is a live database and is

updated annually if an issue arises.

Social Development Directorate

Limerick City and County Council Housing Programme 2017

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the staff in attendance for this item.

The Executive Planner, Social Development, gave a PowerPoint presentation on the

Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. She informed the Members that it was a five-year

plan with five key Pillars, which were as follows:---
3

1. Address Homelessness.

2. Accelerate Social Housing.

3. Build More Homes.

4. Improve the Rental Sector.

5. Utilise Existing Housing.

She stated that the current demand for housing for the Municipal District of

Cappamore-Kilmallock was 6% of the overall total for housing countywide, with Caherconlish,

Bruff and Kilmallock the main areas. She explained that the projected target for 2018-2021 for

Social Housing would be approximately 1,600 which would be attained through the ten funding

programmes set by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

She informed the Members that of this projected target 60% would be from new build.

The Executive Planner, Social Development, stated that the main aims of the Action Plan

were as follows:

1. Balanced development across City and County in accordance with housing need.

2. Maximise re-use of existing vacant housing stock in the city, towns and villages of Limerick.

3. Utilise investment in housing to deliver wider benefits.

4. Influence Government policy.

5. Outcomes rather than outputs.

The main key actions were noted as follows:

• Balanced incremental development – multiple small/medium scale projects developed

rather than large scale redevelopment.

• Maximise all of the avenues for delivery.

• Use the powers available to Limerick City and County Council to encourage urban

consolidation and growth.

Information was also provided to the Members under the following headings:

• Social Housing Construction.

• Role of Approved Housing Bodies.

• Regeneration Programme.

• Rent Pressure Zones.

• Vacant Housing Stock.

• Repair and Lease/Buy and Renew Schemes.

The Members expressed concern in relation to the Estate Management of the Council’s

stock and stated that the need for greater community focussed activities in these estates would

be key to their success. The Members requested that all lands be checked and assessed under

the land aggregation scheme and, in particular, lands in Bruff and Caherconlish. It was noted

that one-off housing was important for rural people and also, taking into consideration the

pressure on private rental availability in towns within the District. The Members highlighted

the importance of the supply from Part V developments for a spectrum of applicants on the

housing waiting list.---

In reply to queries raised by the Members, the Director of Social Development stated

that there was a need to strengthen the Council’s current Estate Management procedures and

that they would be working closely with An Garda Síochána and engaging with the

Communities.

The Members thanked the relevant staff who were in attendance for this item and

requested that they return in a couple of months with a presentation specific to the Municipal

District of Cappamore-Kilmallock.

Other Matters Raised

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the

following items were raised:

•

Ash Hill Manor

Councillor Donegan expressed concern in relation to foul odour issue in Kilmallock town. It

was noted that the Waste Water Treatment Plant located at Ash Hill Manor housing

estate had previously caused problems as the pumping system had been designed for a much

higher number of houses than were actually constructed. The pumping system was

subsequently modified and this resolved the odour issue in the town. The source of the

present odours would require investigation by Water Services working on behalf of Irish Water.

The Senior Executive Engineer agreed to follow up with Water Services.

•

Shannon Commercial Properties

The Meetings Administrator confirmed that a representative from Shannon Commercial

Properties would attend the July Meeting of the District.

•

Correspondence

The Cathaoirleach referred to correspondence received in relation to request from group of

residents to attend the June Meeting of the Municipal District to discuss source of funding and

location for footpath in Nicker. Following a short discussion, on the proposal of Councillor O'

Donnell, seconded by Councillor Donegan, it was agreed that the Members would be first fully

briefed by staff at the next Meeting on the specific issues concerning this matter.

•

Update for Next Meeting

The Members requested an update on the following:

 Speed Limit Review.

 Road Works Programme (for July Meeting).

 Age-Friendly Seating.

 Tourism/Marketing Proposals relevant to the District (Laura Ryan, Communications Officer,

Economic Development, and Majella O’Brien, Staff Officer, Economic Development, to be

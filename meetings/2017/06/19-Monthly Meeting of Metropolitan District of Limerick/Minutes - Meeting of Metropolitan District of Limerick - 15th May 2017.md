**(b)**

**Limerick City and County Council Housing Programme 2017**

The Senior Executive Architect presented an overview of the Council’s Housing Programme 2017

which included the following :

 An overview of Rebuilding Ireland – Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness – July 2016

from the national and local viewpoint, including targets, funding, delivery mechanisms and

local project details.---
3

 The role of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in housing provision and their relationship with

the Council.

 An overview of regeneration, rent pressure zones and vacant housing stock.

 A review of the Repair and Lease Scheme.

 The aims and key actions of the Council’s housing policy.

Members welcomed the presentation and made the following points during discussion of this

item :

 Emphasis should be placed on the construction of Council houses as the purchase or rent of

property by the Council could put it in competition with the private market.

 Properties located on Mallow Street had the potential to be improved under the Buy and

Renew or Repair and Lease Schemes.

 The increased involvement of AHB was noted and while AHBs had additional tenant supports

in place the co-ordination of their activities with the Council was important.

 Every effort should be made to fast track the tender process involved in house construction.

 There were insufficient houses being built to meet supply and many of the sites designated

for housing on the Development Plan were either landlocked, unserviced or tied up with

NAMA. Other sites without such issues should be considered.

 Properties with distressed mortgages should be purchased by Councils and rented back to

the occupants to avoid the involvement of vulture funds.

 Rent caps should be applied to areas of Limerick in acknowledgement of increasing rents in

areas such as Dooradoyle / Rathkeale.

In response to issues raised by Members the Senior Architect, Social Development clarified the

following :

 There were approximately 31 AHBs active in Limerick, many of these operated on a small

scale and any contribution made by AHBs to the provision of housing units would be

welcomed.

 AHBs needed land ownership to develop sites but conditions would be attached to any such

transfer of lands from the Council.

 When purchasing houses the Council would not compete with first time buyers and would

withdraw from any transaction where vacant possession was not available. Of the 200

houses considered for purchase in 2016, the Council purchased 50.

 The maximum number of Council houses considered on any site would be 40 and it was

important that both public and private housing would be available, going forward.

 There was a three month lag in figures relating to rent pressure zones which may explain

why Raheen and Dooradoyle were not yet included.

 A number of single properties, many of which had difficulties associated with them, were

being looked at in the context of the Buy and Renew Scheme. Multiple properties could also

be looked at and any information that the Members had in relation to properties that could

benefit from the scheme would be welcomed.

 Increases in population and homelessness had been taken into consideration in the Council’s

plans.

 Part V discussions with private developers indicated a pick up in this market in the areas of

Raheen, Castletroy and Newcastle West.

 In relation to the activation of land, four sites had been submitted to the Department under---
4

the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund Scheme with a view to the State providing

the infrastructure to open up same. This included sites at Mungret and Greenpark.

Members requested that they be circulated with a copy of the presentation.

**QUESTION**

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

**I will ask at the next meeting for an update regarding the traffic management study underway**

**for the Dock Road and the plans to include the Raheen, Dooradoyle and Mungret areas as part**

**of a greater traffic study for Limerick that was due to commence in 2017.**

**REPLY:**

A preliminary plan for improvement work on the Dock Road carriageway was

prepared in 2016. Funding has not been made available to progress

improvements on the Dock Road to date and the Council will be seeking the

required funding from the DTTAS in 2018.

A wider land use planning study is required for the Dock Road area and it is

hoped that this land use plan with complementary upgrade plans for the Dock

Road can be progressed over the next 12 months. It will be necessary to fund this

study from Development Levies and the Council will be looking to allocate a sum

of €70,000 in 2017.

The National Transport Authority has confirmed that a strategic transport study

(the Limerick Transport Strategy) will commence in Quarter 4 of 2017.

The Raheen, Dooradoyle and Mungret areas will be considered as part of this

strategic study.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**7.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

**I will move at the next meeting that traffic wardens and litter wardens be deployed at regular**

**intervals to patrol all residential estates in the immediate vicinity of University of Limerick**

**where a large percentage of Limerick's Student accommodation is based, with effect from**

**mid-September.**

Following discussion it was agreed that this motion would be sent to the Travel and

Transportation and Environment Strategic Policy Committees.

**8.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council extend the 30km speed**

**limit pilot scheme to other estates in the city especially where speeding is a big issue and**

**residents request it.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.---

In proposing the motion Councillor Secas noted the need to change driver behaviour and make

estates safer for vulnerable users. She pointed out that extending the 30 kmph speed limit to

other estates would facilitate the enforcement of safer driving in these areas.

Members supported the motion and called for more 30 kmph speed limit signs to be erected in

the pilot estates and for increased speed van and Garda presence to coincide with the

introduction of 30 kmph limits. A view was expressed that there was no evidence to suggest

that the 30 kmph limit was appropriate or effective.

Members noted that motions similar to this had been sent to Strategic Policy Committees for

consideration and highlighted the need for consistency in this regard and it was proposed by

Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Hourigan, that a review of standing orders relating to

the Metropolitan District take place, to include the review of how notices of motion should be

dealt with.

**REPLY**:

The Council is currently undertaking a general speed limit review in accordance

with the provisions of the Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in

Ireland. The question of extending the 30 kmph speed limit to other estates is

being considered as part of this review.

The Director, Physical Development noted that new approaches, such as table top pedestrian

crossings at junctions that also act as speed ramps and also controls for cyclists, were being

implemented to reduce traffic speed and increase safety.

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

**I** **will move at the next meeting that the Council allocate sufficient funding from the Budget of**

**2018 to upgrade and take in charge the road to Carrigogunnell Castle in Clarina, on the banks**

**of the River Shannon.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Lynch and seconded by Councillor Gilligan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Lynch highlighted the historical significance of

Carrigogunnell Castle, its links to U2 and location adjacent to the Wild Atlantic Way, all of

which enhanced its potential as a significant tourist attraction. He highlighted the lack of

signage or appropriate parking in association with the Castle, the need to upgrade and take

in charge its approach road and the State’s associated obligations under the Florence

Convention.

Members supported the motion and emphasised the historical and cultural significance of

the site and the need to fully develop its potential, in conjunction with the Council’s Tourism

Officer, for the benefit of the city and county.

**REPLY**:

The question of the provision of funding for the taking in charge of roads and

estates in 2018 is a matter for consideration by the Members of Council when

agreeing and adopting the 2018 budget.

In this particular case, the road in question is 620 metres long by an average

width of 3 metres. It serves four houses, some farmland and is also used as an---
6

access to Carrigogunnell Castle, a ruined 13th Century Castle on private property.

The road is in poor condition, badly shaped with a rough, uneven surface. The

cost of bringing this road up to standard for taking in charge is estimated at

€36,000. This involves regrading the road with Clause 804 material followed by a

double surface-dressing.

The option of upgrading and taking in charge this road will be considered as part

of the Council’s scheme in 2018, having regard to the funding available and the

priority ranking of this particular request when compared to the priority ranking

of other estates.

An alternative option is for the users of the road to apply for a Local Improvement

Scheme whereby they would be required to pay just 20% of the cost of the works

(equal to €7,200) and the Council would carry out the works when the scheme is

approved.

However, it must be noted that if a local improvement scheme is applied in this

area, then the Council would not subsequently take the road in charge and the

road would remain in private ownership.

The Meetings Administrator acknowledged the views expressed by Members and undertook

to bring same to the attention of the Economic Development Directorate and the Tourism

Officer.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

**I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council write to the OPW to**

**acquire the sites at Mary Street and Edward Street to develop and use as part of our housing**

**stock, given we have such a lack of units throughout the city.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Costelloe and seconded by Councillor Prendiville.

In proposing the motion Councillor Costelloe noted that both sites were neglected with the

Mary Street building in the Medieval Quarter of the city and detracting from same.

In seconding the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that these sites were earmarked for

private development under the Minister’s plans for 700 such sites around the country. He

noted the ongoing need for Council housing and called for a mix of Council and private

housing to be built on these sites.

Members supported the motion and noted the ongoing need for more houses to be built on

available sites.

**11.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence, as circulated, was noted.---

At the conclusion of the agenda, and with the permission of the Mayor, Ms. Lisa Ruttle,

Assistant Staff Officer, Public Interest Development presented details of the Town and Village

Renewal Scheme 2017 which included an overview of the scheme, selection criteria, key

dates and types of projects to be considered. She noted that the Council was seeking

expressions of interest from town or village groups with suitable projects for consideration

under this competitive scheme.

Members noted the closing date for submissions of 26th May, 2017 and that emails in

relation to the scheme had already been circulated. Members thanked Ms. Ruttle for her

presentation and discussed its potential to apply to various projects in the District.

This concluded the Meeting.

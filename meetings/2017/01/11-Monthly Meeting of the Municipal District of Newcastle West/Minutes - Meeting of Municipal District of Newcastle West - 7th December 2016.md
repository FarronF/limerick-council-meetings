Meeting with Transport Infrastructure Ireland

The Cathaoirleach said that a meeting had taken place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland as

2. Customer Services Directorate
Libraries and Museum

The City and County Librarian addressed the Meeting and explained the “My Open Library”
Scheme to the Members. He said the Scheme allowed for additional opening hours for libraries.
over and above their scheduled staffed hours. Under the scheme he stated that registered
members could access the library through self-service from 8am to 10pm, 365 days a year,
outside staffed hours. Meeting rooms and community spaces could also be made available for
use. He added that the scheme, if introduced, would attract a broader range of customers by
allowing access at times that would suit the customer.

He went on to state that, if introduced, there would be no reduction in staffed hours, He added
that the role of library staff was recognised as key to the expansion of the library service in local
communities.

He summarised the services that could be available through the scheme as follows:

¢ Borrow and return books and other items using self-service.
e Use public computers and WIFI.

e Print and photocopy.

e Study ina quiet space.

e Larger percentage of the usage would be for study.

In response to a query from Members, he said that the scheme was being piloted in
Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo, Banagher and Tullamore, Co. Offaly, since November 2014. It was noted
that the pilots were deemed successful and that a number of recommendations for the rollout
of the service countywide had been made. A key recommendation was that a further pilot
should be tested in each local authority in both urban and rural settings in order to assess the

viability of the project.

It was noted that the Department had approved 23 projects in 23 Local Authorities, subject to
all works being completed and commissioned by 30" November, 2016. Cappamore Library had
been included on this list as it was deemed the best match for Open Libraries i.e. self-service in
place, public toilets, meeting spaces, high visibility for security.

The City and County Librarian confirmed that no consideration had been given at this pilot stage
to Newcastle West, Abbeyfeale, Glin or Dromcollogher Libraries. The work and cost involved in
adapting the branches to the required Open Library standard would be prohibitive.

A discussion took place on the scheme and the following points were made by the Members:

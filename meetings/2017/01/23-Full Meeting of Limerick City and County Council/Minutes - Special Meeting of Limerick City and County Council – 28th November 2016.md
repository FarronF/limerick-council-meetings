Limerick/Foynes Road Improvements Scheme

Circulated, report of the Director, Physical Development, dated 25th November, 2016.

The Deputy Mayor stated that the Special Meeting was being held arising from Special

Meeting of the Council held on 21st October where it had been agreed that a further

Meeting would be held to update Members on the design of the proposed interchange to

support the connectivity of Croagh Village to the Limerick/Foynes Road Improvements

Scheme.

Councillor Keary addressed the Meeting as follows:

“Deputy Mayor, I would like to personally thank you for facilitating this very

important meeting today. To begin, I would like to welcome the people from Croagh

and surrounding areas to the public gallery but I am extremely disappointed and

embarrassed as an Elected Member of Limerick City and County Council with the

report that has been prepared and presented here today following last month’s

Special Meeting. It does not satisfy the requirements of the Motion that was passed

here on 21st October, 2016. This is a disappointing generic report that was basically

copied and pasted and belittles the intelligence of those for whom it was intended.

We the Elected Members of Limerick City and County Council, along with the people

of Croagh and the surrounding rural communities of West Limerick, deserve better

and to be treated with respect. We are now in the dying days of 2016, things have

moved on and I personally am not interested in kicking the can down the road,

wasting time and valuable taxpayers’ money.

This is not acceptable. I am today requesting, with the support of the Elected

Members of this Chamber, a definite timeline in which a decision will be made

available to the people of the Croagh area. Is it going to be 3 months or is it going to

be 4 months – please tell us here today. At the last Special Meeting on Friday, 21st

October, 2016, a Motion was unanimously passed by this Council which read:

“I will call on Limerick City and County Council to support the connectivity of Croagh

Village to the Limerick/Foynes road upgrade; that all relevant technical and socio-

economic environmental expertise would be engaged by Limerick City and County

Council in both the design and implementation of the said interchange; I am

requesting a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council on the same date

as the November Meeting of Limerick City and County Council. On that occasion, I

will be requesting an advanced update on the design of the proposed said

interchange.”

As is clearly evident, the report presented by the Executive here today falls well

short of the above Motion. I do not appreciate, or accept, the content of this report

which is, once again, non-committal. I am now looking for a full update on the

process to date since our last meeting on 21st October, 2016; how many meetings

have taken place regarding same and I am also requesting the minutes of these

meetings to be made available to Elected Members in the interest of openness and

clarity. I would also like to know who is the direct point of contact between Limerick

City and County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

I am demanding the convening of a Special Meeting between the Elected Members

of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, representatives of the Executive of

Limerick City and County Council, representatives from the Mid-West Road Design

Team, representatives from Roughan & O’Donovan Consultants, and Transport

Infrastructure Ireland, at a location suitable to all. On this occasion, I will be

demanding a breakdown of all expenditure to date associated with this project.

Under the Limerick City and County Council Capital Programme 2017-2019, an

amount of €7 million has been allocated to finance the continued design of this

project. I do not have any problem with this large amount of money being allocated,

provided it is spent wisely and, in doing so, addresses the concerns and needs of the

citizens who we are all elected to represent.

I will finish by calling on this Executive to give a definitive and clear timeline for the

issues that I have raised to be addressed.”

In response to queries raised by the Members, the Director, Physical Development,

stated the following:

• He assured the Members that the report issued was written to update the Members

and had not been copied and pasted.

• He stressed that he always treated the Members with respect and would continue to

do so.

• He confirmed that he was the first line of contact with Transport Infrastructure

Ireland and the Mid West National Road Design Office in relation to road schemes.

• He confirmed that the junction strategy was being reviewed and that any such

review would take time. He noted the concerns of the Members but highlighted the

need for a thorough review to be carried out. The report outlined the complexity of

the decision-making process and that every effort would be made to expedite the

process. He added that the process itself must be robust given that it would be

reviewed by external Bodies such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland; Department of

Tourism, Transport and Sport; Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; and

An Bord Pleanála.

• He confirmed that access for Croagh Village had been considered previously by the

Project Team.

• He asked for the Members’ support to allow the Project Team time to carry out the

necessary studies and review the provisional junction strategy taking into account

the information received.

This concluded the Meeting.

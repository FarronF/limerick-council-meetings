proposal was seconded by Councillor Leddin and agreed.

minutes to facilitate the group in addressing the Meeting, similar to what had been done

at the September Meeting of the Metropolitan District for a residents’ group in

Rhebogue. The proposal was seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

At the request of the Mayor, the Meetings Administrator addressed the Meeting and

outlined the relevant procedure for dealing with requests such as this. In particular, he

made reference to Standing Orders Nos. 103 to 108 which set out the process to be

followed for receiving a deputation at a Meeting. In addition, he explained that, in any

case of urgency or upon Motion made on a Notice duly given, any one or more of the

Standing Orders could be suspended provided that two-thirds of the Members of the

Council present voted in favour of the suspension.

Following further discussion and in response to queries from the Members, the Chief

Executive clarified that a current planning application was on hand for the proposed

development at Irish Cement and that a decision was due to issue on 5th January, 2017.

It was agreed to adjourn the Meeting for 10 minutes to allow the group to meet with

Members. It was further agreed that staff would leave the Chamber and that any

The above table details all cases created on the Council’s Customer Relationship

in 2016 are for the Operations and Maintenance Department. This Department

deals with road maintenance, street cleaning, surface water, road safety, traffic

management,

severe

weather

responses,

housing

maintenance,

traveller---
14

accommodation, maintenance of parks, open spaces and cemeteries and is the

largest Department in the Council. The median completion time on these cases in

Operations and Maintenance is 36 days per the Sugar CRM system. Among the

reasons for varying completion times are issues such as required inspections,

responses from contractors, and adherence to procurement requirements. Works

may also be completed on the ground and delays may occur in the update of the

system. The Council is piloting a mobile application for early 2017 that will allow

instant update of cases.

NOTICES OF MOTION

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council consider utilising the services of a full or

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that parts of Limerick had no

their first therapy assessment was unsatisfactory. He added that occupational therapy was

crucial for enabling all age groups to go about their daily lives when faced with illness, injury

or disability.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keary.

The Chief Executive noted the concerns of Members and, in response, gave a

commitment to review the procedure and systems in place for this area.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (to be

referred to Community, Leisure and Emergency Services SPC)

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Community, Leisure and Emergency

Services Strategic Policy Committee.

backed Bonding where multiple housing developments are approved and (b) a fee be

introduced to recover the cost of reprocessing invalid planning applications.---

Planning Strategic Policy Committee.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

an immediate Referendum to repeal the 8th Amendment, rather than further delaying this

the Citizens’ Assembly.

Councillor Prendiville, in proposing the Motion, stated that he was calling on the

Council to support an immediate referendum to repeal the 8th Amendment. He added that

process in place in the form of the Citizens’ Assembly and that it should be allowed to run its

course and await the outcome.

seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

“I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call for a

Referendum to repeal the 8th Amendment and enact legislation that would allow for

terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest.”

The Mayor stated that, in the absence of agreement, he would take a vote on the

Amendment first. It was agreed that the vote would be taken in the form of a show of

District.

REPLY: We have referred this matter to IPB who provide insurance cover for Limerick City
and County Council. They report as follows:

privately owned slipways/piers.

From Marine point of view, the Council owned slipways/piers exposures should be
insured on a Marine Legal liability policy to protect your interests as owners. If you
can provide us with a list of your owned slipways/piers, we can make sure you have
adequate Marine Legal liability insurance in place.

In relation to the privately owned slipways/piers, there is an exposure to the owners
that would not fall under the Councils Marine Legal Liability policy.’

8. Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on designs for Kilcornan traffic route lighting and
safety measures at Kilcornan National School.

REPLY: A detailed topographical survey of the site has been carried out and the design
work is on-going. The proposal that is going to be submitted to TIl for funding will
include for a new footpath from the entrance to Curragchase to the
school/community centre and traffic calming measures will be proposed from the
cross roads junction west of Kilcornan NS down to the Curraghchase entrance. The
measures proposed will include for kerbing, public lighting, traffic calming signage

Agency (EPA) and Irish Water in relation to the treatment of effluent at Askeaton.

Councillor Sheahan noted that he had met with Irish water in this regard and that a set of
circumstances might arise that many advance works at Askeaton. He noted that Irish Water were
anxious to emphasise that there was no discharge of untreated sewage at Askeaton Plant but

untreated effluent could be discharged from two other discharge pipes and suggested that this be
brought to the attention of the EPA.

The Director, Regional Service noted that Irish Water had carried out a feasibility study in relation
to the improvement of Askeaton Waste Water Treatment Plant and that the next step would be to

portion of land needed to safely complete the path be acquired by CPO. Councillor Sheahan noted

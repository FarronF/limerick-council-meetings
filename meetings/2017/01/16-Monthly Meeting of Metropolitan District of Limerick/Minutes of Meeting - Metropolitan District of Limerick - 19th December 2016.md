for communicating with the media and public, and details for the recovery and

clean-up operations following a flooding incident.

It should also be noted that already this year, the Council repaired a large breach

in the Corbally embankment at the back of Meadow Brook. This work cost over

€40,000 and was funded by the OPW. In addition, a 130 metre long concrete

**Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the traffic situation on Ballysimon Road coming from the city***

***approaching Tipperary Roundabout towards Childers Road Retail Park has been monitored***

***and if any measures have been considered to improve it.***

**REPLY:**

The Traffic Department in Limerick City & County Council continues to

monitor traffic city wide including the Ballysimon Road and Childers Road in the

vicinity of the Tipperary Road Roundabout. This junction does experience traffic

congestion in the am and pm peak times as well as peak weekend shopping

times. The Council were advancing plans to upgrade the Childers Road, Tipperary

Road and the Tipperary Road junction however these plans were put on hold at

the end of 2012 due to a lack of grant funding resulting from the economic

downturn. It is hoped that grant funding can be secured to activate this scheme

again at a future date and in this regard the Council continues to make

representations for roads funding for this and other schemes with the DTTAS.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the calming measures scheme for Annacotty Village including***

***the L-1113 Road has been developed in order to address the speed issues, road crossing issues,***

***etc., and when it is expected to be implemented.***

**REPLY:**

Following representations earlier this year from Members regarding speeding in

Annacotty Village and the approach road L-1113 from Monaleen the site has

been examined by both the Traffic Department of Limerick City & County Council

and An Garda Siochana. On the dates of these visits excessive speeding was not

observed in the village itself however some speeding was observed on the L-1113

approaching the village from Monaleen. To date two sets of speed cushions have

been installed on the approach road to the village from the R445 to slow traffic

approaching the village from this busy road. In relation to the L-1113 the Roads

Engineers will be developing a programme for traffic calming 2017 and

depending on available funding traffic calming measures on the L-1113 will be

considered. The Roads Engineers will meet with Members in 2017 to discuss

traffic calming measures for Limerick City East. The introduction of a 30kph speed

limit for Annacotty Village in 2017 as a road safety measure will also be

considered as part of the National Speed Limit Review.

***license application, or is one being prepared?***

**REPLY**:

Following a competitive tendering process, the Council engaged consultants to

carry out an appraisal of the air quality, health and climate change elements of

the applications and further submissions. The consultants report is expected to

be completed this week. The Council will consider the contents of this report and

make a decision on whether a submission to the EPA is appropriate.

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the vacant sites at the old Dunnes on Liddy Street, the Robert***

***Street site beside the Milk Market and the abandoned Horizon Mall development site have***

***been investigated recently to see if they qualify as derelict sites?***

**REPLY**:

The Roberts Street site beside the Milk Market was investigated and the owner at

the time was engaging with the Council, it is the Council’s understanding that the

The old Dunnes Site – Direct engagement with Dunnes Stores has been taking

place over the last 18 months in regard to this site.

The Horizon Mall – the Council is aware that fresh proposals for the site are being

prepared, in that context it would be prudent to await the submission of any such

proposals.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the Council has a register of the owners of inner city properties***

***and if not, can one be established.***

**REPLY**:

The Property Registration Authority (Land Registry) has statutory responsibility

for mapping of all land/property and the ownership associated with this

land/property. Not all land/property is registered with the Property Registration

Authority, however, it is now compulsory for all land/property transfers to be

registered with the Property Registration Authority.

The Council has access to the Property Registration Authority records, for which

we have to pay a fee for each property folio that we download.

As the Council is not the statutory body responsible for the compilation and

maintenance of property ownership records, it is not possible for a list of

property ownership to be complied/maintained. However, should it be

necessary to ascertain the ownership of certain properties, then ownership

searches can be undertaken, as they arise.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***I will call at the next Meeting on Limerick City and County Council, in partnership with Limerick***

***Smarter Travel, to extend the City to UL Riverbank Cycle/Walkway to cover the Castletroy and***

***Annacotty Area.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

In proposing the motion Councillor Secas commended the Smarter Travel staff for the works

carried out to upgrade the Cycle / Walkway along the river to UL thereby providing more

comfort and safety for its users. She pointed out that the increased use of this route,

subsequent to the improvements works, was proof that people will use these amenities when

provided. In seconding the motion Councillor Leddin highlighted the benefits the improved

surface provided to the elderly and the disabled and the need to promote the use of this, and

similar amenities at Cleeves Bank and the Baggott Estate. In supporting the proposal to extend

the improved pathway to service the Castletroy and Annacotty area Councillor Leddin

highlighted the potential of partnering with UL in this regard.

Members supported the motion and made the following points during discussion of same.

 There was a need to create a protected cycle / walkway connecting the new park in Mungret

to the city, via the Baggott Estate.

 A feasibility study should be carried out on a riverbank walk to Coonagh.

 People considering whether to come to live / work in Limerick take amenities into

consideration. The development of the riverbank should be considered in this regard by the

relevant SPC.

 Plans produced by the City Council to develop walkways all around the city should be re-

examined.

**REPLY**:

At present there is no funding to expand the new UL to City Centre riverside cycle

walkway further into Castletroy/Annacotty. The Council will be making an

application for funding to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport

(DTTAS) in 2017 for this and other cycle schemes.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District request the consultants***

***working on plans for Revitalisation of O’Connell Street and Limerick City Centre consider***

***adding to their current models the possibility of expanding the current ‘Urban Garden’ at the***
---

***O’Connell St/Cruises St area into a full pedestrianised iconic town square, including drawings,***

***and an assessment of the impact on traffic of redirecting cars around the side of Burger King,***

***onto Liddy St and back up William St.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville highlighted the benefits of removing traffic from

the city, the need to reduce national CO2 emissions and avoid potential pollution fines and the

need to work with Bus Eireann to enhance services in conjunction with park and ride facilities.

Members pointed out that consultants had been appointed in connection with the

redevelopment of the city centre and that a consultation process was underway in relation to

same. Members highlighted the need for ongoing communication between the consultants and

the public / Elected Members and raised concerns in relation to the workings of elements of the

proposals contained in the motion.

Following a show of hands it was agreed that the motion would not go forward and that a

workshop should be held with the consultants in the new year.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Cian Prendiville, John Gilligan and John**

**Costello**

***We will*** ***move at the next Meeting that Limerick’s Metropolitan District***  ***write to Irish Water***

***and the relevant Minister urging them to introduce an exemption for charity organisations***

***and not-for profit sport clubs from the standing charge element of their water bills.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted the difficulties experienced by the Womens

Network in paying the standing charge portion of their water bill which was placing a serious

burden on their finances.

Members noted that a national all party committee was looking at the issue of water charges

and that this issue would be addressed by same.

Following discussion it was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor Collins, seconded by Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh that the motion be amended as follows :-

“That Limerick Metropolitan District write to Irish Water and the relevant Minister urging them

to introduce an exemption for charity organisations and not for profit sports clubs from water

charges”.

Councillor Secas noted previous discussions at District Meetings in relation to motions of this

nature dealing with national issues that were not necessarily relevant to the business of the

District and the need for clarity in relation to same. The Meetings Administrator pointed out

that he had looked for nominees previously from the various political groupings to discuss this

issue and repeated that request.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh (to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council conducts a review of the M7, within the***

***Metropolitan District, with a key focus on how the route is affecting traffic in the city.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on the Minister for Local Government,***

***for equal status and equal treatment to be given to all Local Electoral Areas in Limerick.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh stressed that there was no individual statutory

meeting for each of the three Electoral Areas in the Metropolitan District, with Operational

Briefings held behind closed doors and procedures for the Metropolitan District Meetings

confusing. He pointed out that the merger had not benefited the city and that there was a need

to restore proper democracy.

Members expressed contrary views as to the effectiveness of Operational Briefings and agreed

that a review of the practices and structures associated with the Metropolitan District was

timely.

The Meetings Administrator noted that many of the motions coming forward from the District

Members related to policy matters and it was good practice to forward these motions to the

relevant SPC and avail of the outside expertise associated with same.

In response to an issue raised by Members the Meetings Administrator noted that a protocol for

the wearing of Chains of Office was in place.

The Director highlighted the changes that had been introduced by the Local Government

Reorganisation Act, 2014 with additional powers devolved to Municipal Districts and

acknowledged the need for a workshop to be held with the District Members in the New Year to

discuss issues identified.

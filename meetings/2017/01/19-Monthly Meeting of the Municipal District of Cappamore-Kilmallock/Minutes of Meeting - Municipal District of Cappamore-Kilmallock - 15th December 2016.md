**Customer Services Directorate**

**Libraries and Museum**

Circulated, Report in relation to “My Open Library” Initiative at Meeting.

The City and County Librarian addressed the Meeting and explained the “My Open Library”

Initiative to the Members. He said the initiative allowed for additional opening hours for

libraries over and above their scheduled staffed hours. He stated that under the initiative

registered members could access the library through self service from 8am to 10pm, 365 days a

year, outside staffed hours. Meeting rooms and community spaces could also be made

available for use. He added that the scheme, if introduced, would attract a broader range of

customers by allowing access at times that would suit the customer.

He went on to explain that, if introduced, there would be no reduction in staffed hours. He

added that the role of library staff was recognised as key to the expansion of the library service

in local communities.

He summarised the services that could be available through the scheme as follows:

 Borrow and return books and other items using self service.

 Use public computers and WIFI.

 Print and photocopy.

 Study in a quiet space.

 Larger percentage of the usage would be for study.

In response to a query from Members, he said that the scheme was being piloted in

Tubbercurry, County Sligo, Banagher and Tullamore, County Offaly since November 2014. It was

noted that the pilots had been deemed successful and that a number of recommendations for

the rollout of the service countywide had been made. A key recommendation was that a

further pilot should be tested in each local authority in both urban and rural settings in order to

assess the viability of the project.

It was noted that the Department had approved 23 projects in 23 Local Authorities, subject to

all works being completed and commissioned by the 30th November, 2016. Cappamore Library

had been included on this list as it was deemed the best match for Open Libraries i.e. self

service in place, public toilets, meeting spaces, high visibility for security. The timeframe given

by the Department of 3 months to tender, source and commission the Open Library Initiative,

meant that Phase 1 of the project had been required to go ahead immediately in

September/November. This had involved greatly enhancing the security systems at Cappamore

Library. The work was grant aided in the sum of €35,000 approximately and it was agreed that

this represented a positive in terms of additional security for the library.

A discussion took place on the initiative and while some Members acknowledged the

opportunities, concerns were raised in relation to the following:

 Anti-social behaviour.

 Security of property/equipment.---

 Safety of persons using the facility in the absence of library staff.

Members queried if the decision to roll out initiative in Limerick was an executive / reserved

function.

**6A.**

**The ‘Thomas Fitzgerald Centre’ Bruff and the Old School House, Grange**

Circulated, Report of the Administrative Officer, Property Services dated 12th December, 2016

in relation to proposed works to the ‘Thomas Fitzgerald Centre’ Bruff and the Old School

House, Grange.

Members welcomed the proposals to carry out the improvement works outlined. It was agreed

that a further update would be given at a future meeting.

The Acting Director of Support Services (Finance, Corporate, HR and ICT) stated that funding

had been received for the following under the REDZ Scheme :

€100,000 for Kilmallock / Charleville Engineering Hub;

€200,000 for Kilmallock / Charleville Loop Walk.

**QUESTIONS**

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Ryan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many burial grounds are in the Cappamore-Kilmallock***

***Municipal District and their locations; how many of them are closed; how many have***

***available burial spaces and how many in use with no available spaces.***

**REPLY**:

There are 86 Burial Grounds in Cappamore / Kilmallock Municipal District.

Approximately 60 of 85 Burial Grounds are closed either formally or informally.

Only those families who have existing burial plots can be interred within

closed burial grounds so long as burial plot is not full.

A

survey

is

required

to determine

exactly

how

many spaces

are

available within these Cemeteries. 26 Burial Grounds have burial plots available

within them in varying amounts. It is unknown how many are in use with no

spaces available, as not all our cemeteries have caretakers.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a survey to be undertaken of the Council's lighting system in***

***Hospital as it needs upgrading. In addition extra lighting is required around funeral homes***

***and outskirts of Hospital on the Limerick side and on Knocklong side towards Tennis club.***

***This is a health and safety issue and must be addressed as a matter of urgency. I will also***

***ask what the time frame will be for this report.***

**REPLY**:

The existing public lighting in Hospital is currently being assessed and a report

including detailed costs for the replacement of them on the regional road will be---
5

completed in January 2017. Due to the large number of lights, it is likely that

they will be replaced on a phased basis. Additional lights cannot be provided as

there is no provision in the 2017 budget for new public lighting works.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock calls on***

***the CEO of Limerick City and County Council to immediately suspend any roll out of the ‘Open***

***Library Initiative’.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehy stated that the “My Open Library” Initiative, if

introduced, would devalue and threaten the place of libraries in society as a place of social,

cultural and educational learning. She emphasised the critical and very important role played

by library staff. The risks from a health and safety perspective were raised as was the threat to

security of property and equipment. Anti social behaviour was also highlighted as an issue.

Councillor Sheehy said she would not be supporting the roll out of the initiative and would

oppose any decision to introduce the initiative in Limerick.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Gleeson stated that he was totally opposed to the

initiative. He added that the library in Cappamore was a state of the art facility and one which

the community were proud of. He said he would not be supporting any initiative which would

give unsupervised access to the library. He made reference to a number of serious issues which

had been highlighted as part of the pilot scheme in other local authorities. He concluded by

welcoming the extra security measures which had been installed at Cappamore Library but

reaffirmed his total opposition to the initiative.

The following items were raised at the conclusion of the Agenda :

Members welcomed Mr. B. Murphy, Senior Executive Engineer and Mr. D. O’Dea, Assistant

Engineer to the District and stated that they looked forward to working with them. Members

thanked Mr. G. O’Connor, Acting Senior Engineer for his work in the District and wished him

well in the future.

Councillor Gleeson indicated that he had attended the Meeting with Transportation

Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and gave an update to Members. He stated that Part 8 Planning

Approvals would be prepared in the coming months for O’Rourke’s Cross and Beary’s Cross

Improvement Schemes. Members thanked Councillor Gleeson for representing the District at

the Meeting which had coincided with the official opening of Ballingaddy Burial Grounds. His

apologies for non-attendance at the opening were noted.

Members congratulated Superintendent William Duane on his appointment to the District and

extended their good wishes to Inspector Luke Conlon. It was confirmed that Superintendent

Duane would be invited to the January Meeting.---

**Junction on the Adare Bypass**

Circulated A3 map showing the current proposed junction layout for exit to Adare from

proposed new Limerick Foynes Road as published in June, 2017.

Members noted the concerns of the Fitzgerald family, owners of the Woodlands Hotel,

at the proposed layout of the junction at Adare and noted that the Fitzgeralds had

engaged engineering consultants Punch and Partners to draw up alternative junction

layouts and also engaged Financial Consultants Grant Thornton to assess the economic

impact of the options and submitted same to the Mid West Road Design Team.

Members strongly voiced their support for the proposals brought forward by the

Fitzgeralds and made the following points in relation to same;

• The Woodlands Hotel employed in excess of 220 people and was held in high

regard locally.

• The Woodlands Hotel purchased in excess of €1m worth of goods annually from

the Adare locality.---

• The Lantern Lodge, which had been renovated to a high standard, was regarded

as the historic gateway to Adare and locals would take issue if it did not remain as

such.

• It was estimated that up to 60 jobs in the Woodlands Hotel will be lost if the

current design proposal proceeded.

• The Fitzgeralds had consulted with other hotel owners in the area in relation to

their alternative proposals and these had indicated their support for the

Fitzgerald proposals.

• The Members requested that serious consideration be given to the economic

impact of the current proposal on the Woodlands Hotel and that the financial

impact analysis prepared by Grant Thornton, submitted by the Fitzgeralds, should

only be evaluated by those qualified to do so.

• Under current proposals traffic exiting the bypass would have to negotiate either

three or four roundabouts to access the Woodlands Hotel and this was excessive.

Members noted the support of local Councillors and TD’s for the Fitzgerald proposals, to

be examined and considered by the design team, and a number of Members undertook

to actively campaign in this regard.

Staff from the Mid West Road Design Team acknowledged the issues raised by Members

and made the following points in relation to same;

• Several meetings had already taken place between the Mid West Road Design

Team and the Fitzgeralds, along with their consultants, to discuss their proposals

and same would be taken into consideration, along with all other submissions

along the length of the scheme.

• A significant amount of consideration had gone into the layout of the proposed

junction with a number of alternatives considered.

• Under the Fitzgerald proposal, all traffic entering and exiting Adare at the

proposed junction would be obliged to travel an additional 1 km each way and

the time, cost and benefits of same, along with additional carbon emissions

would have to be taken into consideration.

• The roundabout at the Lantern Lodge would have to be replaced and enlarged as

part of the proposals put forward by the Fitzgeralds.

• Traffic wishing to go to the Woodlands Hotel would be required to pass through 2

or 3 roundabouts under the Fitzgerald proposals as opposed to passing through 3

or 4 roundabouts under the current proposed layout.

• The impacts of all submissions would be taken into consideration and the Design

Team would have to stand over the design proposals with An Bord Pleanala.

The Director, Physical Development noted the strategic importance of the bypass to

improving the economic position of Adare and County Limerick generally and the need

to have regard to the interests of all of Adare.---

It was noted that a further design update for the full scheme would be available early in

2018 and Members requested that the issues they had raised at this meeting be

regarded as a submission on the design.

The Director, Regional Services confirmed that this would be the case.

This concluded the Meeting.

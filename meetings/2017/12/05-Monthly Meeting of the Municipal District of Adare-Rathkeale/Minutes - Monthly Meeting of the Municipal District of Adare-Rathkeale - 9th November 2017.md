**I will ask at the next Meeting for the detection rate of illegal waste dumping in**

The Council investigates all litter / waste incidents reported in the

In 2017, 12 spot fines have been issued to date, two court cases are

pending and there have been four successful prosecutions under Litter /

Waste legislation in the Askeaton area.

Councillor Sheahan noted the extent of litter generated in Rathkeale arising from the

activities of unlicensed traders and called for litter wardens to be put in place for the

two weeks up to Christmas. Members agreed that the most appropriate time for litter

wardens to operate during this period would be between 1.00 p.m. and 9.00 p.m.

Limerick City and County Council tenants are required to maintain their

property in accordance with the letting agreement. The current ‘Letting

Agreement – Housing Act 1966 (As Amended)’ stipulates the following:

Section 6:

*thereof, in a clean and proper state and shall not allow any refuse or*

*offensive matter to accumulate in any portion thereof*.”

Section 13:

“*The Tenant(s) shall be responsible for all internal decoration and for any*

*breakage of glass and any damage to fixtures, fittings or the structure of*

*the dwelling, and for the proper maintenance of fences, including gates, of*

*the garden or plot and shall cause to make good any damage or breakage*

*without delay and where such works, damage, or breakage is carried out*

*or repaired by the Council, shall pay the cost of such works to the Council.”*

Councillor O’Brien sought clarity on the obligations on tenants to maintain the outside of

their properties and noted that he would submit a Motion in this regard for the next

Meeting.

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien**

**I will move at the next Meeting that, in light of the recent EPA report, this District calls**

**on Irish Water to prioritise a waste water treatment facility for Foynes to prevent**

**waste water flowing into the Shannon estuary.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Brien and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

Members discussed the inadequacy of sewerage treatment facilities at Foynes and other

locations along and near the estuary and following discussion it was agreed that the

Motion should be amended to read;

“In light of the recent EPA report, this District calls on Irish Water to prioritise waste

water treatment facilities for Foynes, Askeaton and Shanagolden to prevent waste water

flowing into the Shannon Estuary and to provide proper backup facilities for pumping

stations in the event of a power outage”.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor McMahon it was agreed

that the District should write to the EPA pointing out that their recent report,

highlighting the pumping of untreated sewage to waters, should have made reference to

Askeaton where the overflow pipes at the treatment plant discharge untreated sewage

to waters during periods of high rainfall. The correspondence should also point out that

the licence granted by the EPA for the treatment plant at Askeaton required the

construction of a new waste water treatment plant and ancillary works, new pumping

station and stormwaters storage capacity by 1st January 2014 and this had not been

compiled with.

**13.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence, as circulated, was noted by Members.

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the consent of the Cathaoirleach, Members

raised the following issues:-

• Councillor Keary requested an update on the drainage issue at Courtmatrix and

requested that this go on the agenda for the next District Meeting.

• Councillor Keary requested an update on proposal for a pedestrian controlled

crossing for Adare. The Meetings Administrator read out the update that had

been circulated to Members in this regard as follows;

Central Services, has spoken informally to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)

about the introduction of a signalised crossing at Adare and they have advised that

they have changed zebra crossings to signals at other locations on the national road

network over the last few years and that their analysis post installation has indicated

a reduction in the road capacity. It should be noted that they are not formally

refusing to consider the Council’s request for a signalised crossing, but they will need

further information. Central Services intend to progress with traffic and pedestrian

counts when resources permit and prepare a feasibility report for submission to TII.

Councillor Keary requested that this item appear as a recurring item on Agendas for

the District Monthly Meetings.

• Councillor Sheahan requested an update on the request to improve the walkway

along the N69 at Askeaton. The Meetings Administrator read out the update that

had been circulated to Members in this regard as follows;

The existing gravel walkway is becoming overgrown with grass and difficult to walk

on despite having been cleared earlier in the year. The Council will clear it again

once all the leaves have fallen from the overhanging trees. The Executive Engineer,

Rathkeale Area Office will cost a proposal to provide a macadam surface that will

require less maintenance and be easier to clean with a sweeper.

• Councillor O’Donoghue raised the issue of community concerns at the proposed

route of the Croom Distributor Road and requested an update from the Design Team

before Christmas.

The Director, Regional Services undertook to organise a workshop in this regard.

• Following discussion it was agreed that the December Meeting of the District would

take place on 5th December, 2017 at 5.00 p.m.

• It was agreed that a Special Meeting to consider the Part VIII associated with

proposed traffic calming in Rathkeale should take place on the 15th November, 2017

at 6.30 p.m. and be preceded by a workshop on the same topic at 6.00 p.m.

This concluded the Meeting.

NOTICES OF MOTION

***locations within the Municipal District be compiled.***

Councillor Scanlan in proposing the Motion stated that the National Parks and Wildlife

Service would have responsibility in this area. Members raised the issue of eradication and

treatment of knotweed and a difficulty with inputting location details on to the app was also

stated. Further education and awareness leaflets were required for members of the public

and at Council depot locations.

It was agreed that these issues would be raised with A. Goggin, Senior Executive Engineer,

Physical Development Directorate.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

**REPLY**: The Council has developed an App for the recording of Invasive Species.

The Council has already collected significant data through the Invasive Species App,

both from members of the public and Council Staff.

The attached screenshot from the Invasive Species App, shows all sightings of

invasive species, but the majority of the recorded sightings in West Limerick are

Japanese Knotweed.

While there is a significant amount of Japanese Knotweed throughout the county,

the position in West Limerick appears to be particularly severe.

However, it must be noted that the surveying of every road and the logging of all

sightings of invasive species would require extensive time and resources which we

do not have available in the area at present.

The App is an excellent tool for recording the location of invasive species and the

Council is of the view that the recording of locations would be enhanced through the

use of the App by Council staff, members of the public, interested community

groups, voluntary bodies etc.

The Council will continue to publicise the availability of the Invasive Species App with

a view to increasing public awareness.

Council staff have been trained in relation to recognising invasive species and they

are currently using the app to record findings.

**13.**

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that a pedestrian crossing be provided at the library***

***Abbeyfeale in the interest of safety.***

In proposing the Motion Councillor Galvin stated that children cross this busy street near

the library/Supervalu daily. Discussion took place on the removal of the Keep Clear sign and

on the width of the footpaths. It was agreed that the provision of a pedestrian junction at

this location would be reviewed as a safety measure in consultation with the Transport

Infrastructure Ireland (TII).

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that a clean-up operation be carried out in the three social***

***housing estates at Clash, Abbeyfeale. I will also move that this District calls on An Garda***

***S*íochána to work with the Council in order to stamp out anti-social behaviour in these**

**estates.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin outlined the various issues in these estates and

stated that investment was needed to upgrade infrastructure. The other Members

concurred with the sentiments raised and a meeting with the Gardaí, Estate Management

Unit along with the Public Representatives was to be arranged.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

**15.**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council put a pedestrian***

***crossing in front of Broadford National School in the interest of safety.***

location, the school, parents and Community Council have requested a pedestrian crossing.

It was agreed that the provision of a pedestrian crossing at this location would be reviewed

as a safety measure under the GMA Roads allocations 2018.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

A request was made by Councillor Browne to receive a delegation from the Abbeyfeale

Community Council to attend the December Meeting of the District and this was agreed.

The Cathaoirleach noted that Curlings Bridge was now open and complimented the Senior

Executive Engineer on the works carried out. The provision of an additional Bus Shelter at

**Speed Limit Review**

Circulated, Report of the Acting Senior Engineer, Operations and Maintenance Services, dated

15th November, 2017 setting out the background to the speed limit review and the preparation

of related Draft Bye Laws for Non National Roads and National Roads. It was noted that

submissions, proposing changes to the Bye Laws, were assessed in accordance with “Guidelines

for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland” (March, 2015) and that an Engineer’s Report,

with recommendations, was completed in respect of each location. It was also noted that

workshops had been held with Members in each District and issues raised by Members were

reviewed by the Council Executive or TII, as appropriate, and the outcome of these reviews was

now being presented to the District Members for consideration. The report noted that Members

approval was sought to proceed with the publication of Draft Byelaws for public consultation, in

accordance with the aforementioned guidelines.

Also circulated:

• National Road Speed Limit Review 2015-2017;

• National Road Speed Limit Review 2015-2017, Limerick National Road Draft Bye-Laws;

• Limerick City and County Council, County Limerick Road Traffic Special Speed Limit Byelaws

2018 for Regional and Local Roads (Draft);

• Speed Limit Review Submissions received for the Metropolitan District for Non-National

Roads.

At the outset the Acting Senior Engineer noted the issues that had been raised at workshop by

Members requesting an increase in the speed limit on the R527, Condell Road and pointed out

that, following a review of same, it was not recommended that the speed limit on this road be

increased. He noted that the National Cycle Manual, published by the National Transport

Authority, identified that the appropriate speed limit for this road type, with a non-segregated

cycle lane adjacent to a live carriageway, was recommended at a maximum of 50kph.

Members noted the frustration of drivers using this road having to limit their speed to 50 km/hr

but noted the danger to cyclists sharing the same surface with vehicular traffic and discussed the

benefits of segregating the cycle lane from vehicular traffic and having a shared pedestrian /

cycle facility.

Members also noted issues around unconnected segments of cycle lanes in the city and the

need for a cycle strategy and suggested that an audit of cycle use on the Condell Road be carried

out.

The following additional issues were raised by various Members during discussion of this item :-

• The request to reduce the speed limit on the R511 between Roxborough and Fedamore. The

recommendation not to alter this speed limit was accepted with engineering measures to be

looked at.

• The request to increase the speed limit on the R445 from Daly’s Cross to the County

Boundary from 80 km/hr to 100 km/hr to match the speed limit on the Tipperary side of the

boundary.

• The high density and extent of school traffic at Ballybrown and it was noted that the request

to reduce the speed limit there to 50 km/hr had been accepted.

• The request to reduce the speed limit on the R526 from the flyover at Ballykeeffe into the

city to 30 km/hr to facilitate those living along this road to gain vehicular access to same.

• A possible error on the review document issued in relation to the L1144 Mill Road. It was

clarified that the document was correct and that no alteration was proposed for the speed

limit on this road.

The Acting Senior Engineer clarified the position in relation to the speed limit arrangements for

the N7 at Junctions 28, 29 and 30 and for the M7/M20 Rossbrien Interchange.

The Acting Senior Engineer noted that the adoption of the bye laws was a matter for the Full

Council and that the approval of the District was sought to move on to the public consultation

phase.

Following discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Hourigan, seconded by Councillor Gilligan

and agreed that the speed limit on the Condell Road, R527 be increased from 50 km/hr to 80

km/hr in conjunction with the segregation of the cycle lane from vehicular traffic.

The Director, Physical Development emphasised that the Council strongly recommended no

increase in the speed limit on the R527 Condell Road considering the presence of a non

segregated cycle lane adjacent to live traffic.

It was proposed by Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor O’Dea and agreed that the speed

limit on the R445 be increased from 80 km/hr to 100 km/hr.

Government Department.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the merits of the bridge from a tourism and

Limerick City and County Council has received grant funding in respect of Bridge

Rehabilitation Works in the sum of €428,000 from DTTAS to fund works of repair

vehicular traffic where significant funding is not required.

The Council has also received an allocation of €700,000 under the 2017 Specific

Improvement Grant for Thomond Bridge.

However, the costs of restoration works to the black bridge have been estimated

at €1m.

under the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme.

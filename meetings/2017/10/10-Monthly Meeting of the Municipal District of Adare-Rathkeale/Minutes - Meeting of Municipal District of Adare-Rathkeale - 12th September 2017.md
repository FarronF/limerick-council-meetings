• The introduction of traffic calming measures at an estimated cost of €178,000

plus VAT.

• The consideration of a one way system along main street (R523) to be put on

hold pending the installation and review of the effectiveness of traffic calming

measures.

Members thanked the Director, Regional Services for her update and in response to

queries raised by Members, the Director noted that the Gardaí would be in contact with

the Courts Service with regard to the provision of special sittings of the District Court

over Christmas and that she would be in a position to meet representatives of the

Community Council to discuss proposals she had outlined.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division noted that, in

relation to traffic calming measures and to enable the Council comply with the statutory

process, a related Part VIII was advertised on 14th September, 2017. He pointed out that

the latest date for submissions in relation to the Part VIII would be 23rd October, 2017

and that a Special Meeting of the District may be required to expedite the process.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division circulated and

reviewed seven draft discussion drawings numbered L/RK/17/RM/(0001 to 0007)

detailing the proposed traffic calming measures for Rathkeale Town. Also circulated was

map showing a revised traffic layout for Rathkeale incorporating a one-way system on

Main Street.

Members discussed the proposed traffic calming measures and the following points

were made in relation to same:

• The proposed traffic calming measures would need garda support as many of the

vehicles being driven in Rathkeale would not be slowed by speed ramps.

• New Line Road was extensively used by goods vehicles and the width of this road

should not be compromised.

• The location of ramps proposed at TT5 and TT6 was a congested area and this

should be taken into consideration in planning any ramps at these locations.

• A long stretch of Well Lane, over which many vehicles speed, had no proposed

calming measures. A similar situation arose in relation to Thomas Street and

leading to Mick Neville Park.

• Consideration should be given to including additional traffic calming measures in

the Part VIII, pending the availability of additional funding.

• A pedestrian crossing should be considered for Thomas Street.

• The issue of the safety of children on Church Street should be taken into

consideration.

• In relation to any one way traffic system on Main Street, consideration should be

given to any fire or emergency response and also the effect on businesses.---

The A/Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division acknowledged the

issues raised by Members, he clarified that any table top ramps would be full road width

and noted that rumble strips gave rise to noise considerations.

The Director, Regional Services noted that the Council would be seeking a Garda

commitment in relation to the enforcement of traffic laws and that consideration was

being given to the recruitment of additional traffic warden resources. She also noted

that contacts had been made with the Department of Social Protection, the Health

Service Executive, Túsla and An Garda Siochána towards a Multi Agency approach.

Limerick Heritage Plan and noted the benefit of having the plan in place to support the

drawdown of any related funding that might become available.

Members welcomed the plan and the following points were made by Members in

relation to this item.

• The need to support the activity of reed cutting on the Shannon Estuary which

employed in excess of forty people. The A/Senior Executive Planner, Economic

Development undertook to engage with the Heritage Council and the reed

cutters in this regard.

• An Audit of all listed and protected structures should be carried out to assess

their viability as it should be acknowledged that some of these building would

never be restored as sufficient financial aid was not available.

• The Old Abbey in Adare should be re-roofed and brought into community use.

• Curraghchase House had significant potential and should be restored.

• Many old churches and graveyards in the District were in a state of disrepair with

insufficient funding allocated to their upkeep.

• Many protected buildings had commercial potential but the extent of

administration associated with their development was preventing the realisation

of this potential.

The A/Senior Executive Planner, Economic Development noted the limited amount of

funding available from the Heritage Council and undertook to take the issues raised by

Members into consideration when reviewing the Development Plan.

**(c)**

traffic flowing through the village and the traffic delays created by uncontrolled street

crossing by pedestrians. Members also noted the availability of statistics with regard to

traffic movements, the potential to build a further car park adjacent to the town park

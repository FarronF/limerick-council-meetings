**Adoption of minutes from Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning**

**SPC meeting of the 3rd of April 2017.**

The draft minutes as circulated were adopted on the proposal of Cllr Eddie Ryan,

seconded by Cllr James Collins.

**Matters Arising**

A query arose as to why Social Enterprise wasn’t included on the agenda.  Eileen

Humphreys updated the members as follows:

A Task Group / sub-committee has been set up under the LCDC to examine the

scope for further development of social enterprise in both urban and rural areas and

to report back with practical suggestions. The sub-committee comprises DSP

(Regional Manager), staff of the Local Development Companies working on social

enterprise and a staff member, LCCC. An initial meeting has been held. At this

meeting, it was agreed not to get too involved in issues such as definitions of social

enterprise (of which there are many) but to take a whole approach to it with the focus

on what can be done that is of benefit to enterprise, job creation and addressing

needs in communities. It was also proposed to expand the membership of the sub-

committee to include an academic at the Kemmy Business School, UL with expertise

in social enterprise. This was agreed at the LCDC meeting on June 7th last.

Ms Humphries outlined that there are a number of existing programmes in rural

areas to support social enterprise including actions under LEADER and the SICAP---
programme. SICAP supports unemployed people to progress into employment in

social enterprise.

There are also a number of new opportunities which could support the development

of social enterprise/social economy such as the reintroduction by DSP if the

Community Services Programme(CSP).

Enterprise Ireland under the Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme will issue a call

for proposals later in the year.

Ms Humphries also responded to queries from members regarding night care for the

elderly, rural isolation and rural sustainability.

The members requested that the SPC receive an update on Social enterprise at

future SPC. This was agreed.

**Item 2**

**To consider Notice of Motion deferred from meeting of the 5th** **of December**

**referred from full Council meeting on the 28th** **of November 2016:**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr J. Scanlon:**

***I will move at the next meeting that, in future, (a) planning grants require fully***

***cash backed Bonding where multiple housing developments are approved and***

***(b) a fee be introduced to recover the cost of reprocessing invalid planning***

***applications.***

The members generally welcomed and supported the notice of motion. There was

concern among members that the Council had to spend its own funds in order to

complete estates where the bond was not sufficient to meet the taking in charge

costs. Mr. Duclot informed the members that we currently have new strict measures

in place with regard to new developments and bonds.

It was agreed that this issue does not just concern Limerick it is a national issue.

The Council is awaiting new guidance from the Department in that regard. It was

agreed that there would be further discussion at the SPC upon receipt of same.

A number of concerns were raised regarding a number of derelict sites in the City

Centre that are continuing to deteriorate. The members requested that an audit be

carried out of all derelict sites in Limerick and what the future plans for them are.

Regarding part (b) of the motion fees are set up under the Planning & Development

Regulations so we are not in a position to change this process.

**Item 3**

**Metropolitan District of Limerick on the 18th** **of April 2017.**

**Notice of motion submitted by Cllr C. Prendiville**

***‘I will move at the next meeting of Limerick’s Metropolitan District that the***

***Council look to amend our development plan to ban the development of***

***incineration, gasification, fracking and other environmentally damaging and***

***destructive industries in Limerick City & County Council.’***---
It was agreed that this item would be deferred to the next SPC meeting as Cllr C

Prendiville was not in attendance.

**Item 4**

**Update on the Great Southern Trail and proposal to change its name to the**

**Great Southern Greenway Limerick.**

Members received a presentation update on the Great Southern Trail from Brian

Kennedy. The presentation covered a number of key areas including

 Tourism context

 Great Southern Greenway progress to date

 Part VIII works to be carried out

 Future Potential – Other examples

 Furture development of Greenway – key priorities

The members welcomed the presentation. John Sheahan proposed that the Great

Southern Trail be renamed Great Southern Greenway Limerick and this was

seconded by Cllr. James Collins.

The members paid tribute to Mike McDonald and Liam O’Mahony who have worked

on the Greenway for a number of years.

**5. A.O.B.**

Brian Thompson raised an issue regarding the agenda and minutes of SPC

meetings. He requested that these be sent out 2 weeks before the meeting to give

them the opportunity to discuss them with the PPN members.

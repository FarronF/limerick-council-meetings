‘| will move at the next meeting that the Council calls on Gas Networks Ireland to
ensure that the proposed Gas Pipeline from Foynes to Kerry Co-op plant in Listowel,
take into account the location, the design and capacity of the pipe for future potential
demand i.e. the Industrial Landbank at Tarbert/Ballylongford, the Power Station in
Tarbert, the existing manufacturing businesses in Glin and the future possibility that
the people of Glin Town would have access to domestic gas supply.

Members were anxious that any investment by Gas Networks Ireland in a new gas
pipeline from Foynes to Listowel be future proofed to ensure that its capacity is
adequate for current and future demand from industry along the route and to make
provision for town gas for Glin.

It was unanimously agreed to refer the motion back to the full Council with the
recommendation that the Council write to Gas Networks Ireland calling on them to
future proof their proposed investment.

Item 4.
To consider Notice of Motion referred from full Council meeting of the 23rd of
January 2016.

‘| will move at the next meeting that Development Levies on all building projects
commenced between 1“ of January and 31" of December 2018 be reduced by 90%
to provide a much needed incentive to the Construction Industry’.

While members were somewhat sympathetic to the motivation behind the Motion i.e.
to kick start construction projects throughout the city and county, there was concern
regarding the impact of the motion on the newly adopted Development Contribution
Scheme. If the motion were passed by the Council a complete review of the Scheme
adopted in January 2017 would need to take place.

It was agreed that the Council would monitor the effect of the existing Scheme on
increased levels of construction and if it was found that it was not having the desired
impact the members could undertake a review of the scheme at that stage.

Item 5.
To consider Motion referred from Council meeting on the 23rd of January
2017:

Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr, J. Sheahan.

‘That the €7 per sq metre rate of planning contribution for residential development be
extended to towns and villages and do not have statutory zoned lands within a Local
Area Plan. That the line defining the boundaries of such towns and villages be
drawn for Development Contribution purposes only’.

Members expressed concer with the rates of contribution attaching to smaller towns
and villages compared with the reduced rates in the larger towns. It was felt that the
Scheme should treat all towns and villages whatever their size in an equitable
manner.

Given the consequences of altering the recently adopted Development Contribution
Scheme it was agreed that this motion would not be pursued at this stage but could
be re-introduced at a future time if required.

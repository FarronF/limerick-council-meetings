**Item 2:**

**Consideration of Notion of Motion submitted by Cllr. L.M. Sheehy**

***“I*** ***will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City & County Council calls***

***on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community & Local Government to***

***retract the policy that has introduced the roll-**out of the „Open Library‟***

***Initiative across Local Authorities”.***

Cllr. Sheehy discussed the importance of libraries and the many services they offer including

events & exhibitions and also, the strong sense of community they encourage. Staff-less

libraries are anti-community and can lead to anti social behaviour, she stated. She added that

this could lead to a reduction in visits and a reduction in staff which would eventually lead to

the closure of libraries.

Another concern was raised in relation to the provisions for disabled customers if an

alarm/fire alarm is going off and the library is unmanned.

Several Councillors supported the notice of motion including Cllr. B Teefy, Cllr. M Sheahan,

Cllr. S Lynch, Cllr. M Hourigan, Cllr. F Foley, Cllr. G Mitchell & Cllr. C McMahon.

Cllr. M Hurley suggested the Council wait and see how the pilot in Sligo & Offaly proceeds

before making a decision.

Cllr. F Foley acknowledged the work of the Librarian Damien Brady and all the library staff.

Mr. Brady outlined the pilot scheme which allows for over and above hours running parallel

to usual staffed opening hours i.e. before and after official times. He added that a reduction in

staff hours is not expected and stated that under the pilot scheme the opening hours will be

from 8am to 10pm, 7 days a week, 365 days per year while staff will work their normal

hours.

Mr. Brady acknowledged it will bring a number of challenges, one being the introduction of

high end technology- c.c.t.v. where incidents will be monitored. He advised that members of

the public will have to register to use the open library and complete a short course in health &

safety/fire safety to ensure users abide by the rules. A swipe card will be used to enter the

building and lighting and computers will come on once members enter. He confirmed that it

is not expected to affect staff and that the possibility of a security guard will be considered if

deemed necessary.

Cllr. C. McMahon asked that the extra hours in terms of staff be costed out and Mr Brady

agreed to do this. He pointed out that different areas require different opening hours e.g. in

some villages libraries are empty on a Saturday but are very busy on weekday evenings.

Cllr. L.M. Sheehy highlighted issues that some library staff may have with security citing the

example of if someone has stayed in the libraryall night and something is missing on the

following day. This will take staff away from their normal day to day duties, she added.

Notice of motion was seconded by Cllr. B. O’Donnell.

Cllr. K. Sheahan requested a bigger building be sought for Askeaton library as it is not

suitable and also requested that the building be painted seven months ago. Cllr. M. Collins

supported these requests. Mr. Brady informed members that money has been set aside in this

year’s budget to paint Askeaton library.

**Item 3:**

**Suicide Awareness Working Group** **–** **2017 Workplan**

Cllr. LM Sheehy updated members on the 2017 workplan which included:

 Safe talk & Asist training for all Councillors and nominated frontline staff

who deal with vulnerable people. Confirmation of dates to follow.

 Comhairle na nOg App for mental health to be investigated.

 Public Space project being developed in conjunction with the HSE & Gardai.

 Mentalhealth.ie – Promotion of this site & encourage usage of it.

 Media Guidelines in reporting suicides being drawn up in conjunction with

the HSE & Samaritans.

  Holding a mental health conference/meet up for all stakeholders, if time

allows.

Cllr. S. Lynch asked if the workplan could be expanded to include the education of parents in

how to detect suicidal behaviour in their children and Cllr. L.M. Sheehy discussed the

prevalence of cyber/online bullying. She reiterated the importance of support for parents.

Cllr. J Costello requested training for Councillors as they often deal with vulnerable

constituents with mental health issues.

Cllrs. C. McMahon & M Hurley both stated they attended the Safe Talk training and thought

it was very effective.

Cllr F. Foley acknowledged the hard work of Cllr. L.M. Sheehy and Cllr. L.M. Sheehy

thanked the staff of the council for overseeing the administration of the group.

S. O’Connor stressed the importance of contacting TUSLA or the Gardai in the event of

child protection issues arising in their interactions with their constituents.

**Item 4:**

**Local Economic & Community Plan actions/update.**

This agenda item was deferred to a later date.

**Item 5:**

**Update on St. Patrick’s Day Festivities**

Aoife Potter-Cogan, Arts Officer, delivered a presentation on St. Patrick’s day festivities

which will take place from Friday 17th March to Sunday 19th March throughout Limerick City

& County. Highlights of the weekend are the Limerick St. Patrick’s Day Parade on the 17th &

the International Band Championship on the 19th provided by Limerick City & County,

coordinated by the Arts Office with event production company, Grooveyard Event

Management.

The parade will start at 12 noon at O’Connell Avenue (Wolfe Tone Street junction) and finish

at Merchant’s Quay.

Since being awarded National City of Culture 2014, Limerick City & County Arts Office has

been working on the creative development of the St. Patrick’s Festival Programme. This

process involves collaboration with the Artistic Director, event management company,

creative companies,entertainers and Limerick City & County Council Marketing and

Communications Department.

The theme of this year’s parade is *Our Story-This is where we belong* and sees the Arts

Office working with Lumen, a local street spectacle company. A grant of €5,000 was given to

this new street spectacle company to develop an entry for this year’s parade as part of the

ongoing Festivals & Events Development Strategy.
---
Lumen will focus on delivering a story in the history of the River Shannon in keeping with

the theme of *Our Story-this is where we belong.*

The parade will also welcome creative content from national street spectacle companies Luxe

& Artastic alongside circus acts and drummers.

Luxe are an award winning processional spectacle company and their passion is to bring

their unique decorative style of sensory, multi layered spectacle to communities throughout

Ireland and internationally.

Artastic & Limerick based Spotlight Stage School will come together again in 2017 to bring

their award winning performances and colourful entry Lost in Music to the streets of

Limerick.

17 bands will take part in the 47th International Band Championship consisting of over 1,000

talented marching band musicians from across Ireland, Europe & the U.S.

Led by The Irish Army Band, Ireland’s only international band championship will start at 12

noon, ending with a free concert for the public in Arthur’s Quay Park where the

championship winners will be announced.

The parade is expected to attract 80,000 people into the city.

Cllr. J. Loftus suggested that last year’s parade was too fragmented and said he hoped that

this year’s parade could be arranged in such a way that sets the rhythm and pace for every

group with minimal gaps between groups if possible.

A number of members, including Cllr. M Hurley, Cllr. G Mitchell & Cllr. F Foley

commended Aoife and all of the staff of the Arts Office for all their hard work in organising

the parade and bringing footfall to the city.

J Cotter Coughlan also asked members to encourage people to attend the parade.

**2.**

**Update on Policing in the District**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Billy Duane, Bruff District, to the Meeting and,

along with the other Members, wished him well in his new role in the District.

Superintendent Duane acknowledged the extent of the area he was responsible for and the

limited resources at his disposal. He outlined his plans to use resources from other areas such

as community policing and the Traffic Corps to supplement his resources and pointed out that,

as crime statistics for the area were reducing, it was unlikely that additional fulltime resources

would be allocated. He reviewed crime statistics for the area and noted that a number of

firearms issues had been successfully detected.

Members thanked Superintendent Duane for his presentation and made the following points

in relation to this item.
---
2

• Limerick was under-resourced in terms of Garda numbers, compared to national

averages, and every effort should be made to increase Garda numbers in the District.

• The ongoing use of ‘*text alert’* was critical for the area and the use of CCTV was being

looked at by the Council, in conjunction with the Gardaí.

• Garda visibility was important and gave particular assurance to the elderly, many of

whom were moving into nursing homes rather than remain at home alone.

• Ongoing complaints were being received regarding speeding in estates and Garda

assistance was required to enforce the new 30 km/h speed limit being piloted in a

number of estates.

• Efforts should be made to bring more cases to the Courthouse in Kilmallock which was

underutilised.

• Every effort should be made to develop any available Garda accommodation to

encourage Gardaí to live within their District.

In response to issues raised by Members, the Superintendent made the following points:

 Community Alert was being extended to Ballylanders.

 Any positive drink-driving tests were automatically screened for drugs.

 The Garda Station at Hospital would be manned 3 days per week, with an ad-hoc

arrangement at Oola that would be advertised locally.

 The Traffic Corps would be availed of to tackle speeding issues in the District and every

effort would be made to detect incidents of drug-driving.

 Garda accommodation in Cappamore was being renovated and accommodation was in

place in Murroe.

 The opening of the new Courthouse in Limerick may result in more cases being heard

there.

 The Council should engage first with the local Garda Sergeant in relation to any area of

concern.

The Cathaoirleach thanked Superintendent Duane for attending and looked forward to

meeting him again in the next quarter. Superintendent Duane then withdrew from the

Meeting.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Ms. Karen Burke, A/Senior Executive Planner, Economic

Development and Strategic Planning, to the Meeting.

Circulated, copy of Draft Plan entitled *‘Limerick’s Proposed Heritage Plan 2017-2030 –*

*February 2017.’*

The A/Senior Executive Planner informed the Members that the proposed Heritage Plan

2017-2030 was on public display up to 10th April, 2017, and submissions were invited up to that

date. She noted that the Plan was non-statutory and non-operational and was intended to put

forward policy to support future projects and assist in the sourcing of funding for same. She

noted that €69,000 funding had already been received from the Heritage Council and this had

supported projects on Limerick Lace, Golden Mile, Schools’ Art Competition, Digital Atlas,

works at Bouchier’s Castle and a Shannon Estuary Bird Survey.

Members noted that while the definition of heritage was broad, available funding was

small, and discussed the need to support Kilmallock Town Walls’ restoration, Golden Mile and

the Abbey in Hospital.

The A/Senior Executive Planner noted that considerable consultation had taken place

with the Heritage Council in relation to the Plan, all submissions would be considered and the

Plan would be brought back to the Members at that point.

It was agreed that the Notices of Motion on the Agenda - Items Nos. 11 to 13 - would

be taken at this point in the Meeting.

Notices of Motion

**11.**

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council direct the dog wardens to focus on areas***

***that have a high level of dog fouling and that it will (a) erect extra signage; (b) provide extra***

***dog dirt bags; (c) penalise offenders with fines.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Mitchell, in the absence of Councillor Sheehy,

and seconded by Councillor O’Donnell.
---

**REPLY:**

The Council’s Environmental Inspectors monitor and patrol environmental

issues, including dog fouling, on a daily basis. The problem of dog fouling is an

ongoing issue throughout the city and county. While there has been a

significant increase in the number of dog owners cleaning up after their dogs,

there are still quite a number of owners who do not. The Litter Team has

erected a large amount of *No Dog Fouling* signage in areas where there are

problems with dog fouling and in response to requests from members of the

public.

A Dog Fouling Awareness Campaign was carried out over 12 months ago in

conjunction with the Gardaí. Staff from the Environment Department and

Environmental Inspectors, together with Gardaí, were out and about meeting

with dog owners to raise awareness about the need to carry a bag and pick up

after their dog. Dog litter bags were issued to dog owners as part of the

campaign. The Council also circulated press release and highlighted the issue on

local radio interviews as part of the campaign.

The main feature of the campaign was to increase the level of awareness

amongst the dog owning public to be responsible dog owners and clean up dog

litter. The *‘Any Bag Any Bin’* campaign means that bagged dog litter can be

disposed of in any Council bin.

The Environmental Inspectors have issued a small number of fines for dog

fouling offences and will continue to issue fines for offences in accordance with

the legislation.

Members acknowledged the work that had been carried out by the Council in this area

and enquired as to whether third parties could make complaints in relation to dog fouling.

**12.**

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor W. O’Donnell

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council identify a permanent***

***solution to the recurring road damage on the R514 adjacent to Cahercorney Graveyard and***

***also adjacent to the Council Compound.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donnell and seconded by Councillor Teefy.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donnell noted that the road in question

degraded within hours of rain.

Members supported the Motion and the Executive Engineer noted that drainage on the

road in question needed to be addressed.

**REPLY:**

Road condition surveys are scheduled to be carried out along all regional

roads in 2017.

These

surveys

will

determine

where

permanent

reinstatement works should take place. The R514 is included in the planned road

condition survey.

**13.**

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell

***I will move at the next Meeting that Hospital Waste Water Treatment Plant be immediately***

***upgraded, as a matter of urgency, to make it fit for purpose to comply with present***

***regulations.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Mitchell and seconded by Councillor Teefy.

**REPLY:**

The Notice of Motion, as submitted by Councillor Mitchell, has been referred to

Irish Water for response. The Notice of Motion has been sent directly to

localresupport@water.ie

**7.**

**Regional Services Directorate**

**Part VIII Procedures**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Messrs. T. Fitzgerald, C. Hegarty and R. Kennedy of the

Mid West National Road Design Office, and Mr. P. Bergin of Kilgallen and Partners, Consulting

Engineers, to the Meeting.

**(a)**

**N20 O’Rourke’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme**

Mr. Bergin presented details of the emerging Preferred Options, dated 23rd March,

2017, for N20 O’Rourke’s Cross which included need for the scheme, scheme objectives,

general layout and comparison with scheme objectives.

Members raised concerns in relation to the safety of pedestrians crossing the N20 at the

proposed bus stop. Members noted the proposed right-hand turn from the N20 into the

adjacent petrol station and raised concerns that traffic at this point might back up to the

roundabout. Members noted that a large amount of heavy traffic used the petrol station and

discussed the possibility of a fifth entrance on to the roundabout being provided, giving direct

access to the petrol station. Members pointed out that roundabouts with five exits seemed to

work well elsewhere and noted that such an exit was to be provided to Northern Trust’s

development on the edge of the city.

Mr. Bergin noted that a refuge would be provided in the middle of the road opposite

the bus stop which would facilitate pedestrians. In relation to access to the petrol station, they

pointed out that it was estimated that a roundabout with a fifth exit at this location would have

a 50% greater accident record and, while this option was considered as part of the design, it

was not recommended. The Road Design Team stressed that traffic volumes had to be taken

into consideration when comparing the safety of roundabouts and that the option being put

forward was considered the safest. It was noted that if Part VIII approval was granted and

Transport Infrastructure Ireland funding allocated, the project would move the Compulsory

Purchase Order phase, which was preferred by some landowners and helped to clear title.

**(b)**

**N24 Beary’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme**

Mr. Bergin presented details of the emerging Preferred Options, dated 23rd March,

2017, for N24 Beary’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme which included need for the scheme,

scheme objectives, general layout and comparison with scheme objectives.

It was noted that, as this project proposed works in both the Municipal District of

Cappamore-Kilmallock and the Metropolitan District of Limerick, the related Part VIII would be

brought to the Full Council for approval.

Members welcomed the proposed works and highlighted the future potential of the

N24 in terms of Brexit and requested that this be taken into consideration in relation to any

land-take to facilitate future requirements. Members stressed the importance of engaging with

the public and adjacent landowners as part of the Part VIII process and emphasised the need

for the cul-de-sac that would be created by the proposed works to remain a public road to

ensure its continued maintenance.

The Road Design Team pointed out that any land-take would be confined to the

requirements of the Part VIII and noted that the cul-de-sac referred to would continue to have

a public right-of-way over it and therefore would continue to be a public road.

**8.**

**Physical Development Directorate**

**Amendment to County Development Plan**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Messrs. K. Lehane, Director, and V. Murray, Senior

Engineer, to the Meeting.

Circulated, Limerick Northern Distributor Road Public Information Leaflet, Variation No.

5 to Limerick County Development Plan 2011-2016 (Extended), dated February, 2017.

Mr. Murray gave a PowerPoint presentation dated 23rd March, 2017, which gave details

of the proposed Limerick Northern Distributor Road, including the location of, and need for, the

proposed road, its benefits and what it would deliver and the steps needed to make planning

provision for the road, with related timescales. It was noted that the proposal to amend the

‘County Development Plan’ would be considered for approval by the Elected Members of

Limerick City and County Council in May 2017.

Members raised concerns as to the uncertainty and timelag involved in protecting

corridors of land and how this impacted on the landowners in question, and queried how the

proposed road would impact on receipts at the Shannon Tunnel toll.

The Senior Engineer noted that the proposed variation of the County Development Plan

represented a vote of confidence by the Council to protect the corridors in question, something

that was required by the Department of Transport before funding for detailed design would be

released. In relation to tolling, it was noted that shadow tolls were being looked at nationally

and it could not be predicted where tolling would stand in ten years’ time.

The Director stressed the importance of getting feedback from the Members and the

public in relation to the project and noted that there was no absolute requirement to take any

dwellings where the proposed road would pass through the two corridors being protected.

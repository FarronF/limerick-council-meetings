**Question submitted by Councillor F. Foley**

***I will ask at the next Meeting (a) for an update on provision of CCTV System for towns of***

***Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale; (b) what funding is available.***

**REPLY:**

It is proposed under the Limerick Hinterland Report that a distributed “Smart

CCTV System” comprising of 50 to 70 Smart CCTV Cameras (depending on

proposals received during procurement) is deployed in a pilot project across the

county, according to local needs, in consultation with An Garda Síochána and

local community.

The estimated cost is €500,000 which will be required for:

• €350,000 capital of investment in CCTV and communications equipment and

installation.

• €150,000 over 3 years for annual maintenance and communication costs.---
5

**Funding:**

€250,000 by Limerick City and County Council and €250,000 by the Department

of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

The aim of the pilot is to develop an integrated Smart CCTV System that can

serve local communities in the longer term and can be expanded if more funding

becomes available in the future.

A technical assessment has commenced to document the CCTV Systems in use by

the Council and to define the standard technical capabilities required for the

CCTV. As the CCTV will be deployed in rural towns with limited connectivity

options, the Council is also assessing the communications infrastructure required

for CCTV recording and monitoring.

Following this assessment, more clarity will be available in relation to the

minimum standard technical specifications of cameras, communication

interfaces, recording equipment and monitoring options. This will inform the

solutions that will be sought during the procurement phase. The proposed

locations and the estimated number of CCTV cameras to be deployed in each

town will be agreed through public consultation and within the budget

constraints once the technical specifications are finalised. A statutory Part VIII

will be considered depending on the type and value of the contract that needs to

be put in place.

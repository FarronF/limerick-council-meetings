Development Association to address the Meeting.

Mr. O’Brien highlighted the various projects and works being carried out by the Development

Association and outlined the following issues that were of ongoing concern;

• While plans were in place to improve the right hand side of the approach road from

Glin the left hand side was also in need of improvement and advice was sought in

there was a need to erect railings or raise the level of the ground adjacent to the path;

• There was a persistent issue of sediment in the water in the village;

• There was concern as to the quality of road reinstatement that would be carried out

after the gas pipeline was laid through the village and the Development Association

was seeking to establish the appropriate person in the Council to liaise with in this

regard;

• Due to the gradient of the roads in the village, safe entry and exit from the village in

times of frost was an issue and there was a need to grit, even one of the exit roads

from the village;

• The green area at the Shanagolden side of the village, adjacent to the river, was in need

**(ii)**

**Nomination to the Proposed Consultative Group for the Great Southern Greenway**

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development dated 21st February,

2017 attaching terms of reference for the proposed Great Southern Greenway Consultative

Group and requesting the District to nominate a Member to same. On the proposal of

Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O’Brien, it was agreed that Councillor O’Donoghue

should represent the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale on the proposed Consultative

Group for the Great Southern Greenway.

**(iii)**

**Intention to Lodge Part VIII for the extension of the Great Southern Greenway**

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development dated 27th February

2017 setting out details of the Council’s intentions to lodge a Part VIII application in

connection with proposals to extend the Great Southern Greenway walking and cycling route

from Rathkeale to Ballingarrane, Co. Limerick along the former Limerick to Kerry Railway line.

Members noted that the proposed Limerick to Foynes road would impact on this portion of

the proposed greenway and requested that this section would be shown clearly on any maps

to be provided and that the final route for the Greenway, at this point, should be selected now

to ensure that it would not be disrupted by the new road and that finances invested in the

Greenway would not be wasted.

The Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development made the following point in response to

issues raised by Members;

• Discussions had been held with the Palentine Society in relation to the potential use of

a stone building, in their charge, in association with the greenway. While the Palentine

Society had no plans in this regard the matter could be considered by the Consultative

Committee;

• The Rail Line was the property of Iarnród Éireann and broadband services were running

along the length of same. Landowners adjacent to the line had been met with in

relation to the proposed greenway and no issues had been raised, to date;

• Road Design had undertaken to design the proposed road in consideration of the

greenway and make the greenway available during the road works. It should be noted

that 700m of the 3km greenway section would be affected in this regard and any

expenditure would be minimised on this 700m section, pending construction of the

road.

**(b)**

**Proposed Heritage Plan 2017-2030**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Ms. Bernadette Collins, Executive Planner and Mr. T. O’Neill,

Heritage Officer to the Meeting. The Executive Planner informed Members that the proposed

was intended primarily to be broad based to facilitate the allocation of funding from the

Heritage Council as suitable projects arose. She noted that projects funded to date included

Golden Mile, Bouchier’s Castle, Digital Atlas, Limerick Lace and a Bird Survey on the estuary,

which was required in conjunction with any proposed development on the estuary.

**Operations & Maintenance Services**

**Burial Ground Maintenance**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Ms. S. McCutcheon, Executive Archaeologist, to the Meeting and

pointed out that a number of old headstones at Clounagh graveyard were leaning over and a

local group were being prevented from carrying out works on same.

The Executive Archaeologist noted that there was a guidance document from the Department

in place in relation to the maintenance of such recorded monuments that recommended,

where a headstone was leaning over by more than 45 degrees, a concrete base with a slot to

accommodate the headstone and a membrane between both should be put in place. She

noted that this issue often arose from the earth at the base of the headstone being exposed

by maintenance works causing it to erode and the headstone to lean over. She noted that she

worked with many groups to give guidance on the appropriate maintenance of burial grounds

but had had no contact with any groups in relation to Clounagh Burial Ground.

In reply to issues raised in relation to the protection of a structure at Kilscannell Burial Ground

the Executive Archaeologist noted that access to the structure had been prevented on

engineering advice. Scaffolding had originally been erected to facilitate the inspection of the

structure and the opportunity had been used to reposition pinnacles back into plumb. Lack of

funding had prevented any further works to the structure.

In relation to the use of modern adhesives to repair split headstones the Executive

Archaeologist noted that the use of an adhesive, stronger than the original stone could be an

issue. She also noted that where dowelling was considered in such cases, the condition of the

stones had to be taken into consideration.

In relation to access being limited to Lemonfield Burial Ground by an electric gate, in private

ownership, the Executive Archaeologist informed the Members that the Council was working

through a series of options with the landowner in question in an effort to resolve this issue.

Members requested that they be kept informed of developments in this regard.

Members raised concern with regard to the safety of a structure at Bruree Burial Ground and

expressed their dissatisfaction at the lack of progress in resolving a range of issues they had

identified at Burial Grounds throughout the District. Members acknowledged the limited

budget available in this regard and highlighted the need to prioritise spending in the short

term and requested that the Executive Archaeologist revert to them in relation to same.

Members stressed the need for the Council to engage fully with community groups to

maximise their potential to carry out maintenance works and supervise same.

Members noted the apparent lack of progress in repairing one of the two thatched cottages in

Adare damaged by fire and requested an update on same.

same. It was noted that the plant room, in particular, at this location was under threat.

the Council on foot of the Government declaration of Travellers as an ethnic group. He

on the Travelling Community. Members looked forward to receiving an answer to the

issues raised at the next Meeting.

• Councillor O’Donoghue raised concerns regarding the number of public lights not

working in Ballingarry, Granagh and Croom and enquired as to whether the Council was

even though there seemed to be no relationship between the survey and the length of

time taken to repair lights not working.

• Councillor O’Donoghue sought clarity as to the length of time taken to repair potholes

and whether the Council had liability for any damage caused by potholes from the time

it became aware of same.

• Councillor O’Donoghue raised the issue of a Council Tenant wishing to purchase their

rented property under the Tenant Purchase Scheme but were prohibited from doing so

because of their weekly income and in spite of the fact that they had the capital on

hand to purchase. The Director noted that elements of the current scheme had been

put in place to prevent money laundering and Members noted that a new scheme was

being devised.

Deputation – County Limerick Youth Theatre

The Meeting welcomed a Deputation from County Limerick Youth Theatre comprising

Ms. Fiona Quinn, who was accompanied by two students, Ethan Mulcahy and Brenna Mulcahy.

At the outset, Ms. Quinn stated that the County Limerick Youth Theatre was originally

an initiative of Limerick County Council and had been set up in 1996. She said over the past 20

years, the Youth Theatre had worked with thousands of people of all ages from all over County

Limerick. She highlighted that the underpinning ideology was that participation in the Arts was

of benefit to the whole community. It increased educational capacity, built friendships and

social bonds, empowered individuals and created social cohesion and enhanced integration.

She expressed concern in relation to funding and support structures for the Youth Theatre

going forward. It was noted that funding had remained the same even though the work and

number of members of the Youth Theatre had increased substantially. She asked if

consideration could be given to the employment of part-time facilitators.

Ms. Quinn delivered a PowerPoint presentation on the County Limerick Youth Theatre

under the following headings:

• Workshops/Performances/Projects.

• Youth Theatre Ireland Launch – 14th February.

• Institutional Capacity Building – Policies and Management, Revenue Control.

• Change Programme.

• Limerick 2020 Bid / Limerick Cultural Strategy / 8 Steps to Inclusive Practice.

The Members thanked Ms. Quinn for her very interesting presentation and it was

unanimously agreed that support was needed for the County Limerick Youth Theatre. They

commended those involved in the programme of work which they said was innovative, varied,

creative and dynamic. A discussion took place on whether the County Limerick Youth Theatre

should continue to operate as an initiative of the Council. The Members were of the opinion

that it should continue under the auspices of the Council. At the request of the Members, the

Director agreed to arrange a meeting between the Group and relevant Council officials in

relation to the issues raised.

Presentation on Plans to construct Walk around Section of Kilmallock

Town Wall

Ms. Sarah McCutcheon, Executive Archaeologist, was in attendance for this item.

A presentation was given on the plans to construct a walk along a section of Kilmallock

Town Wall. During the presentation, an Ordnance Survey Map indicating the established

walkway and the proposed walkway was shown. There was also a Geophysical and

Topographical survey at Ash Hill, Kilmallock. It was explained that some of the lands had not

been the subject of a survey either because of water-logging and vegetation or due to collapse

from Medieval town wall. There was a map showing the Indicative Layout Plan.

The presentation stated that the final location of the walkway would be subject to

further archaeological investigations which were to take place after completion of the current

study. The presentation gave a view of surface dressed walkway showing typical construction

QUESTION

5.

Question submitted by Councillor W. O’Donnell

I will ask at the next Meeting if urgent repairs can be carried out on the L-24004 at Linfield,

Pallasgreen, and where this road is positioned on the Multi-Annual Roadworks Programme.

REPLY:

The road in question, L24004, at Linfield, Pallasgreen, was not included in

the Restoration Improvement Works Scheme 2016 - 2018 which is still in

effect. However, it is hoped that additional funding may be made available

in 2017 and that this funding will facilitate works to be carried out on this

and other roads not included in the Restoration Improvement Works

Scheme. Should sufficient funding be made available, consideration can

be then given to carrying out works at this location. Patching can be

carried out on this road in the meantime as part of routine maintenance

works and the Supervisor will be requested to carry out whatever

patching is appropriate.

Other Matter Raised:

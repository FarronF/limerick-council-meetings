Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council actively
promote the use of the landbank at Askeaton with a view to enticing a suitable
industry to locate at this site.

ice of Motion submitted Cmhir allai

| will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Department of
Agriculture to reimburse the Council for the full cost of horse control in Limerick.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch

| will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Government and the
Minister for Education and Skills to award a set number of extra points, not
exceeding twenty-five (25) (under the Leaving Certificate Points System), to Sth and
6th year students who participate in a formally assessed programme of engagement
with the elderly and other vulnerable people in their community. The purpose of this
programme is to help elderly and other vulnerable people identified by the HSE
and/or Department of Social Protection to continue living in their own homes.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on Minister
Creed to relax the criteria for the Young Farmer Scheme as regards educational
requirements. As it currently stands, the strict deadlines for enrolment in FETAC
level 6 courses means that many worthy applications are automatically excluded
from the scheme. With farming uptake by young people at an all-time low, this
Council considers it of the upmost importance that proper incentives are given to
young people to get involved in farming activities and that the legislation in place is
as inclusive as possible. This Council also calls on the Minister to recognise that the
competence for setting educational criteria and their enforcement is a matter for the
Irish Department of Agriculture and not a European competence. In fact, only 10 out
of 28 EU Member States have chosen to adopt educational criteria as a prerequisite
for availing of Young Farmer funds. Young farmers face an increasingly complex set
of barriers when trying to get on an even footing in their sector. The Minister cannot
continue to deny responsibility when it comes to breaking down some of those
obstacles.

insisting on electronic transfer.

i Motion mi uncillor C. Prendiville

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council agree to make a submission to the
Environmental Protection Agency registering its opposition to Irish Cement’s
proposal to burn tyres and other rubbish in its plant in Limerick.

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and the Minister for Transport urging them to: (i) take action to ensure

immediately implement inspections and oversight of all planes that may be involved
in the transport of prisoners, and (iii) end the use of Shannon Airport by US military

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors K. O’Hanlon (Mayor),

M. Collins, M. McCreesh, C. Prendiville, E. Secas, J. Sheahan,
B. Teefy

We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the
Minister for Education to include the victims of the sexual and physical abuse
suffered in Creagh Lane Primary School in the redress scheme. The victims in
question have fought long and hard and their lives have been undermined and, in
some cases, destroyed as a result of what they suffered as innocent children in the
care of the State. We are calling on the Minister to remove all barriers to gaining
access to the redress scheme for the Creagh Lane victims.

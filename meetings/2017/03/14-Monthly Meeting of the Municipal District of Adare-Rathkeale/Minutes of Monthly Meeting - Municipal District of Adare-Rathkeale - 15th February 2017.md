Question submitted by Councillor C. McMahon

I will ask at the next Meeting, in relation to grants for updating septic tank sewage systems,

Inspection Programme, fail the test and be subject to an advisory notice. Works

undertaken to comply with the advisory notice may be eligible for grant aid subject

NOTICES OF MOTION

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O'Brien

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council undertake such appropriate action to deal with

road side littering on national, regional and local roads in the Adare-Rathkeale District.

In proposing the Motion Councillor O’Brien highlighted the extent of roadside litter exposed by

grasscutting activities and the need to identify offenders in this regard. He noted the

accumulation of litter at Bolane on the N69 and sought clarity as to whether voluntary groups

were permitted to pick litter in such locations.

The Director, Regional Services noted that the Council was not in a position to allow voluntary

groups to carry out operations on roadsides but encouraged groups to operate in a safe manner,

at all times.

REPLY:

Funding is provided for litter picking on all routes under the Schedule of Municipal

District Works. Litter picking is carried out as and when required. Where illegal

dumping takes place this is dealt with by both the Environmental Section and the

local area office.

Members noted the ongoing issue of littering in Rathkeale in spite of clean up works carried out by

the Council. Members noted the need for a litter warden to operate more frequently in Rathkeale

and the potential to use cameras to identify offenders littering in the cemetery in Rathkeale.

Members discussed the potential of availing of contractors to pick roadside litter in order to

reduce costs and the benefits of encouraging community involvement in this regard.

Members noted the extent of works carried out by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in relation

to national roads and on the proposal of Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor Sheahan, it was

agreed that the following Motion should go forward to the full Council in the name of all District

Members and with Councillor Keary as proposer.

“We will move at the next Meeting that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) make direct

arrangements for the gathering and removal of litter along national roads in the administrative

area of the Council.”

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council carry out a survey on all Council owned

graveyards in this district to ascertain the condition of these graveyards, with a particular focus

on headstones.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor Keary.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey highlighted the income accruing to the Council from the

sale of gravespaces and the need to apply this income to the maintenance of graveyards.

Councillor Teskey noted instances of headstone in Clounagh Cemetery which were falling over and
---
6

the Council was preventing locals from straightening same. He requested that the appropriate

staff attend at the next District Meeting to review the Council’s policy in this regard and discuss

same with the Members.

In seconding the Motion Councillor Keary noted that, following the collapse of the church steeple

located in Kilscannel graveyard, scaffolding had been erected and no works carried out while it

was in place. This scaffolding had subsequently been replaced by a fence and access to the site

was still prevented.

Councillor Keary also noted a cemetery in Crecora where access to the cemetery was being

controlled by an electric gate, in private ownership.

REPLY:

In 2017 a new technical member of staff is to be employed by Limerick City &

County Council in Cemeteries, part of their initial duties will be to conduct an up to

date survey and audit of all 255 cemeteries in the ownership of the Council.

This will incorporate burial plot title, headstone condition, the preparation of

accurate up to date drawings of cemeteries and accurately quantifying burial plots

available within cemeteries. This data will all be input into a modern electronic

database and graphical information system for ease of access.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council establishes a second lay-by area on the

entrance to the rear of the Andersen Ireland Factory to facilitate the expected traffic due to the

commercial identity of the proposed business that is to be established there.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey noted the considerable distance between the existing

lay-by and the premises in question and the need to widen this road or install an additional lay-by.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keary who stressed that the business concerned should

finance any further works required.

REPLY:

Innovate Limerick are currently carrying out substantial upgrade works at the

former Andersen Plant which we are confident will result in employment at that

location increasing from 70 persons at present to well over 100 by 2018. As part of

these works, which were subject to Part 8 planning application in 2016 and agreed

with the business concerned, we included a lay by on the road which runs parallel

to the front of the Enterprise Centre and have secured a right of way along that

road and permission for a separate entrance off that road to their part of the site.

I am confident that Innovate Limerick have fulfilled our agreement in full and have

informed the client that they would have to pay for any additional works that they

may wish to have provided for them.

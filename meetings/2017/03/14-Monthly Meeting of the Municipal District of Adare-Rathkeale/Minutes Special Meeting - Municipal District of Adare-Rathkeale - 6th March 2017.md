The Deputation highlighted the plans of Circuit of Munster to hold a rally over the June Bank

include stalls for local producers to promote their produce and items such as story telling and

traditional music being looked at. They noted that the rally was on the National Round of Rallys

potential of the Andersen Site to be included as part of the event, the potential of the event to be

used as a promotion opportunity in conjunction with Henry Ford’s 100 anniversary in Ireland and,

given the interest in rallying in Rathkeale, the potential to hold historic lectures as part of the

weekend.

The Cathaoirleach thanked the deputation for their update and called on the executive to support

the event by ensuring that Rathkeale Town and surrounds was looking at its best during the rally

and festival.

Traffic Calming at Kilcornan

Circulated maps reference TCL-01-05-01-17 and TCL-01-05-02-17 showing the proposed traffic

calming layout at Kilcornan and the proposed works at Kilcornan Community Centre.

The Senior Executive Engineer noted that the site had been fully surveyed and the proposed works

would include traffic calming, signage, drainage and paving overlay with a footpath on one side

and kerbing on the other. He pointed out that there was considerable underground services on

this route that had to be taken into consideration and that the estimates cost of the works were in

excess of €750,000. He noted the need to carry out a traffic count at Kilcornan School Site and

undertook to submit the circulated plans to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) for approval and

funding if the Members were in agreement with same.

Members welcomed the plans as a positive step forward in resolving this issue and made the

following points while discussing same.

• The proposed traffic calming works should be extended to include Kilcornan Church and

graveyard to enhance the safety of users of those locations.

• The works did not include for any drop off and pick up area outside the school.

• Cars turning right into the school approaching from the Askeaton side would block the road

while they waited for an opportunity to turn. This would pose a danger to themselves and

the vehicles approaching behind them and a traffic island should be provided in this

regard. If funding was an issue this traffic island should be provided in lieu of the proposed

footpath.

• Should a traffic island be provided, vehicles exiting the school and turning right would have

to cross two lanes of traffic, thereby increasing the risk of exiting the site safely.

Consideration should be given by the Community Council to purchasing adjacent lands to

facilitate the creation of separate entrances and exits from this site.

• Speed indicators should be installed in conjunction with the works.

The Senior Executive Engineer made the following points in response to issues raised by Members.

• Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) had a finite national budget for works of this nature

and a full scheme, to include the Church and Graveyard would not be facilitated by TII at

this point and the current proposals should go forward.

• There was currently insufficient road width to include an additional turning lane and the

combination of the traffic calming measures, speed limit and public lighting should

enhance the safety of those turning right into the site. While the inclusion of a traffic

island could be reviewed, all proposals would be subject to a road safety audit and the

commitment to funding from TII.

• The proposed works were based on current speed limits. It should be noted that TII were

looking at reducing the distance of the 60 kph limit at this location and that the Council had

submitted comments in relation to same.

Following discussion it was agreed that details of the proposed works should go on display, at a

time to be agreed, by the Cathaoirleach and the Senior Executive Engineer, in the Kilcornan

Community Centre with Council staff present to discuss same.

This concluded the Meeting.

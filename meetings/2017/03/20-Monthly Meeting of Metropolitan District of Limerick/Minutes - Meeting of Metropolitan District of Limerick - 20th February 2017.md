**Schedule of Works for the Metropolitan District of Limerick**

Circulated, report of the Director of Service, Physical Development dated 10th February, 2017

setting out the background to the preparation of a Schedule of Municipal District Works and

including the Draft Schedule of Municipal District Works 2017 for the Metropolitan District of

Limerick.

Members welcomed the increased expenditure reflected in the Schedule of Works and noted

that the increase agreed in the Local Property Tax had been a factor in same. Members noted

the negative effect housing voids had on the neighbouring community and welcomed the

submission made to the Department for funding in this regard. Members noted the need to

maintain footpaths in order to reduce insurance claims and the need to increase the budget

allocated to tree pruning, which was an ongoing issue on estates.

In response to issues raised by Members the A/Senior Engineer clarified the following:-

• In relation to the replacement of existing public lighting fittings with LED lights, this was

being done locally on a needs basis, in parallel with a national programme that involved

the replacement of 275,000 light at a cost of approximately €200 million.

• With regard requested improvements to the footpath from Clarina to Brick Lodge, the

Council had met with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in this regard and a feasibility

study, for submission to TII in the coming weeks, was being prepared.---

• While the R445 was not included as part of the Schedule of Works a Part VIII submission

in relation to same was being progressed.

• Expenditure on winter maintenance was primarily funded by the Department and could

not be allocated elsewhere.

• Tar patching was temporary by nature and there was an expectation that it would be

carried out promptly. Staff were trained on how to carry out this operation and the

patching material was compacted. Any specific areas of concern to Members should be

brought to the Council’s attention.

• It was acknowledged that housing maintenance activities were often reactive, however,

plans were in place to survey the housing stock and draw up a schedule of planned

works. Consideration was being given to drawing down a loan in this regard. The Health

and Safety aspects of Halting Sites would be included in these works.

• The grass cutting pilot scheme, in conjunction with Tait House, would involve the

collection of the cut grass leading to higher running costs. This was a social scheme that

would be under continuous review. While there were environmental gains in leaving cut

grass in situ to act as fertilizer, this practice worked best when the grass was cut

frequently.

• The cost of repairing the Black Bridge at Plassey was estimated at approx. €1m and the

Council was seeking to establish if this cost could be shared.

• In relation to maintenance of the private road to Carrigogunnell Castle, Local

Improvement Scheme funding applied to private roads servicing parcels of land of which

at least two are owned or occupied by different persons and a financial contribution

must be received from the applicant towards the cost of the scheme.

Proposed by Councillor Butler;

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan;

And Resolved:

“That the Schedule of Municipal District Works 2017 for the Metropolitan District of Limerick be

adopted in accordance with Section 103A of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended)”.

**QUESTIONS**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the proposed new City Cycle Strategy to include**

**existing and new cycle routes being considered.**

**REPLY:**

The draft Limerick Metropolitan Cycle Network Study is a high level framework

study funded by the NTA, and completed by Limerick Smarter Travel. The purpose

of the study is to identify and prioritise investment in cycle infrastructure.

The study aims to identify a contiguous series of cycle routes which will provide

for the future needs of cyclists. The study sets out in broad terms a possible

cycling network for the Metropolitan Area for 2025 and will form the basis of

funding and delivery of a cycle network on a phased basis towards an achievable

goal.---

The draft Limerick Metropolitan Cycle Network Study is currently under

consideration and a presentation on the study will be made to the Metropolitan

District of Limerick in due course.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor F. Daly**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on whether or not Limerick is to get a central**

**library and cultural centre, similar to the Lexicon in Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin, for our great**

**City.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council have identified the provision of a new Central

Library as a priority for the development of the Library Service in Limerick.

The project will form part of the Council’s Limerick 2030: **An Economic and**

**Spatial Plan for Limerick** for the redevelopment and re-imagining of the Limerick

City Centre landscape. This significant infrastructural project will be a key

element in Limerick City & County Council’s strategy for delivering on the

Governments national policy, **Putting People First: Action Programme for**

**Effective Local Government.**

The planned Central Library for the new Limerick City & County Council will be

one of the Local Authority’s most inclusive social, cultural and educational

services. It will serve as a City Library for 105,326 people and a Central Library for

the new Limerick Authority for 195,175 people.

It will act as a powerful cultural and social inclusion agent, playing a pivotal role

in strengthening community identity and promoting civic participation. It will

support the Local Authority’s economic agenda through business and job skills

support. It will combat educational disadvantage through the promotion of

literacy and community lifelong learning.

It will be Limerick City’s open and inclusive venue, nurturing the development of

critical thinking and an informed citizenry. It will be a 21st Century design,

responding to and indeed leading the new ways in which people learn and

acquire information. It will address what good digital spaces should look like and

what kind of new learning spaces are needed.

In 2016 the Department of Housing, Community and Local Government

announced a new Library Capital Programme for the period 2016-2021. A new

Central Library for Limerick was included in this programme. The Council is now

investigating the most suitable site for the location of a new Central Library for

Limerick.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Hogan**

**I will ask at the next Meeting, how many Dog Wardens are on patrol at any time in the District,**

**how many dogs are housed in the Dog Control Centre currently, what is the life expectancy of**

**a dog in the Centre, what are the opening hours of the Centre and what marketing initiatives**

**are in place to provide an opportunity for people to visit the Centre when looking to re-home**---
5

**a dog.**

**REPLY:**

The Council has 2 Dog Wardens employed and they are based in the Council’s Dog

Shelter, Mungret. The opening hours of the Dog Shelter are as follows;

Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday

10 am – 2 pm

Wednesday

1.45 – 4.30 pm.

The Dog Pound can shelter up to 20 dogs at any one time and there are currently

4 dogs in the Shelter. The Council aims to re-home as many dogs as possible. In

2016 the Council accepted 712 dogs at the Dog Shelter. 438 dogs were re-homed

or reclaimed by their owners. It was necessary to euthanize 274 due to

behavioural issues, age, restricted breed.

The Dog Shelter has a very active face book which was set up in 2015 and to date

has almost 8,000 likes. The face book page is updated daily from Monday to

Friday and has proven very successful for the re-homing of dogs.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to provide a detailed breakdown of Development**

**Contributions that are outstanding for developments that commenced during the last 10 years**

**and can the list provided highlight development contributions that were offset by other**

**arrangements that resulted in the monetary contribution amount been waived.**

**REPLY:**

The Audited Annual Financial Statement for Limerick City & County Council for

the year ended 31st December 2015 includes a debtor outstanding for

Development Levies in the amount of €30.223m with a corresponding Bad Debt

provision of €28.182m. These figures reflect gross debtors and there are no

offsets due on any of these debtors outstanding.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

**I will ask at the next meeting if the alternative proposals for a more ambitious and future-**

**proofed revitalisation of O'Connell Street, submitted by the Anti Austerity Alliance and the**

**Green Party, will be modelled by the consultants who have been hired by the Council.**

**REPLY:**

O'Connell Street is a dynamic location, with many changing facets and functions.

It is acknowledged that a project of this magnitude, in the heart of the City, will

require a certain degree of flexibility. The street currently functions as a transport

link, as well as a destination in its own right, within the City Centre. The Council's

objective must be to ensure that any final design is significant enough to make a

statement in its own right but is also adaptable meeting existing need and

capable of changing as the City Centre evolves.

ARUP, as Project Consultants, have developed project objectives under 5

headings, according to the Common Appraisal Framework for Infrastructural

Projects, namely:----
6

1. Environment

2. Economy

3. Safety & Physical Activity

4. Accessibility & Social Inclusion

5. Integration

Over the past four months, two public consultation processes have taken place.

ARUP have integrated and utilised the above objectives, as well as all of the

submissions received from stakeholders, businesses, public representatives, and

members of the public including the Green Party to progress the Design Options

and Appraisal Process, for the Project. The Design Options Process has also used

a combination of traffic modelling data, as well as appraisal criteria, to establish

the 5 most feasible options, that offer the greatest balance of improved public

realm, attractions for visitors, better facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and public

transport patrons, while mitigating the impact on access to the City Centre.

Additionally, the Anti Austerity Alliance Party proposal at public consultation in

December to close off vehicular traffic at the north entrance to O'Connell Street,

and divert it over to Arthur's Quay and Liddy Street, was subsequently assessed

by ARUP consultants but was not considered feasible to progress at this time as

part of this project for the following reasons:

• Increase in journey times was significant

• Restriction needed at junction of Henry Street / Sarsfield Street/Liddy Street

• Impact on Denmark Street and High Street for local diversions from Patrick’s

Street.

In addition the diversion of all traffic from Patrick Street through Arthur's Quay to

Liddy Street at this point is inconsistent with the establishment of a pedestrian

plaza in this general area as set out in the Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial

Plan.

ARUP Consultants are currently carrying out additional assessments to assist in

determining the emerging preferred option, to bring forward for the next public

consultation in late March. In addition, the Council and ARUP are continuing to

work on the design of an improved public experience for all users of the street.

This involves engaging with relevant stakeholders, public realm design, basement

surveys and site investigation work on the street.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

**I will ask at the next Meeting, if a consultation will be organised with Councillors to discuss the**

**content of the Council's submission to the EPA regarding Irish Cement's EPA application for**

**permission to burn tyres and other waste in the City.**

**Reply:**

It is the intention of the Physical Development Directorate to make a submission

to the EPA regarding certain technical aspects of the proposed development,

based on the Consultant's report. This submission will be made once a decision

has been made on the planning application. There will be consultation with the---
7

Members in relation to the submission.

**I will move at the next Meeting that this District requests the Government to progress the**

**Coroners Bill as a matter of urgency and that the Coroners Bill will provide for an automatic**

**inquest into every maternal death in the State.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Hurley noted that, while inquests were held in relation to

deaths arising from road traffic accidents, this was not the case in relation to all maternal

deaths. She also noted a range of cases where inquests were held into maternal deaths that

concluded with verdicts of medical misadventure.---

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next meeting that a commitment be given that at no occasion in the future**

**will any further traffic from any future development of Greenpark Racecourse be allowed to**

**access the South Circular Road. The Greenpark Infrastructural Development Plan must take**

**this into account and provide for all access from the Dock Road.**

The Mayor informed the Meeting that this item would be forwarded to the Travel and

Transportation Strategic Policy Committee.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas** **(to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting for the Council to speed up the process and bring forward to**

**Councillors for discussion as a matter of urgency, the draft plans for the road treatment**

**scheme for Dublin Road and for safe access to Gaelscoil Chaladh an Treoigh.**

The Mayor informed the Meeting that this item would be forwarded to the Travel and

Transportation Strategic Policy Committee.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council place a life buoy in the**

**centre of Sarsfield Bridge, as a matter of urgency.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Lynch and seconded by Councillor Hourigan.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Lynch highlighted the importance of life buoys being present

on Sarsfield Bridge to assist in rescuing individuals who enter the river from that point.

Members supported the Motion and stressed the importance of life buoys being present along

the river and praised the suicide prevention work that was taking place in conjunction with

same.

**REPLY:**

There are more than 50 Lifebelts located throughout the City centre at regular

intervals along the various water bodies.

Sarsfield Bridge is a protected structure and the Council is not allowed to attach

any fixture to the structure. There are however 2 adjacent lifebelts located at the

Monument beside Limerick Boat Club and also at Shannon Rowing Club. In

addition, there are further lifebelts in situ along both Clancy Strand and

O'Callaghan Strand which are in close proximity to the bridge also.

Councillor Lynch expressed his dissatisfaction with the reply in that it suggested that a protected

structure was more important than a life. Members suggested that options for the placing of a

life buoy on Sarsfield Bridge, similar to those in place on Thomond Bridge, be explored. The

Meetings Administrator undertook to bring the Members views to the attention of the Water

Safety Officer and to revert in relation to same.---

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh** **(to be referred to the Local**

**Operational Briefings)**

**from the roundabout at junction of Courtback Avenue and Ashbourne Avenue to the junction**

**with the Dock Road on R510 (opposite Car Dealership) and whether this road will remain in**

**private ownership, indefinitely. There is a lot of illegal parking causing severe safety issues for**

**pedestrians crossing to the business and medical services in the area.**

The Mayor informed the Meeting that this item would be forwarded to the Local Operational

Briefings.

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next meeting that the District contact Bus Eireann and the National**

**Transport Authority (NTA) about organising a 'Car Free City' day or weekend, where public**

**transportation would be free in order to encourage more people to use this vital public**

**service, in order to help tackle pollution and climate change.**

Transportation Strategic Policy Committee.

This concluded the Meeting.

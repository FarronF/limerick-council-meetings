To discuss the maintenance of the River Feale, Abbeyfeale.

At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting of the District. He

stated that this Meeting was being held following a Notice of Motion which was raised on the

issue of river erosion and flooding along the banks of the River Feale.

A lengthy discussion took place on the issue of river erosion and flooding along the river banks

which is continuing to deteriorate and also responsibility for the river, all of which were raised

on a number of occasions previously.

The town park was described as a lovely amenity for cyclists, walkers and the elderly but

unfortunately a large section of the town park is closed at present due to health and safety

reasons. The excellent work carried out by the Town Park Committee over the last number of

years in maintaining the upkeep of the town park was acknowledged.

Reference was made to the substantial level of funding invested in the town park from various

funding streams and the importance of seeking further funding to rectify the issues was

highlighted. The previous works carried out by Irish Water near the Water Treatment Plant was

also raised.

The Meetings which took place with various stakeholders and landowners concerning this issue

was referred to and a query as to what role the Council has on this matter was raised.

Following the Notice of Motion which was raised and supported by all the Members present it

was agreed that the following Notice of Motion would be sent to the Minister of State for the

Office of Public Works for reply.

“I will move that the Minister with responsibility for Office of Public Works take ownership of and

responsibility for the maintenance of the River Feale from the rear of Abbeyfeale Town Park right

down to the bridge at Golden Vale Marts, Abbeyfeale where the Allaughan joins the Feale and

that emergency repairs be carried out at the rear of the Town Park immediately”.

It was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Galvin and agreed by all the

Members present that the Minister of State for the Office of Public Works would be invited to

attend the December Meeting of the District. It was also agreed that this item would remain on

the Agenda for future Meetings of the District.

Following discussion, the Meetings Administrator referred to an update received from the Office

of Public Works, stating that a report is to be made available shortly on this matter. The Meetings

Administrator also stated that the Head of Flood Risk Management, Office of Public Works has

confirmed he is willing to discuss this matter when the report is made available.

The Senior Executive Engineer was asked by the Members if he was aware at any time that

funding was granted to carry out works to deal with the erosion issue along the stretch of the

River Feale within the confines of Abbeyfeale Town Park. In response, the Senior Executive

Engineer stated that he was not aware at any time that funding had been granted. The Senior

Executive Engineer also confirmed that no agency of the state had any responsibility for either

the upkeep of Abbeyfeale Town Park or that stretch of the River Feale.

Prior to the conclusion of the Meeting, the importance of having this matter dealt with

immediately was reiterated.

It was also agreed to change the date of the December Meeting of the District to Friday, 2nd

December, 2022, at 3 p.m., at Áras William Smith OBrien.

This concluded the Meeting.

NOTICES OF MOTION

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that urgent and immediate work be carried out on the bridge***

***dividing Kerry and Limerick on the Kilmorna Road.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

An inspection will be carried out at the bridge, if structural repairs are required

Bridge Rehabilitation Scheme. If structural works are required they will be

carried out within that programme.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to dangerous condition of the bridge and

requested that a survey be carried out on the bridge.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that Central Services will carry out an

inspection of the bridge in the near future.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council demand improved***

***levels of service from the ESB.***

If the Notice of Motion is agreed at the District meeting, we will write to the ESB requesting

It should be noted that Limerick City and County Council do try to actively engage with

representatives of ESB locally requesting quotations, contracts, attendance to ESB faults and

connection dates for projects.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to a number of street lights not working

for a considerable period of time in the town of Newcastle West including South Quay,

Mass Path, Assumpta Park, Newcastle West areas and requested that Limerick City and

County Council follow up with the provider to ensure these lights are in working order.

The Members also referred to the Service Level Agreement in place with Airtricity with regard

to the timeframe for having street lights repaired.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that a progress report be provided in respect of the need for***

***a Distributor Road in Newcastle West.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY:

The Newcastle West Local Area Plan 2014 – 2020 (as extended) identifies a proposed route

for a distributor road, which was intended to be developer led. No progress has been made

in relation to the delivery of the road since the adoption of the Local Area Plan.

The Local Area Plan review has commenced internally and it is not reasonable to define the

need or otherwise of such a road at this stage until the review has developed further. Note,

consultants have been engaged to further develop a Local Transport Plan for Newcastle West

as required in the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy.

The Forward Planning and Transportation and Mobility Teams will engage with the Elected

Members of the Newcastle West Municipal District, stakeholders and the public throughout

this process.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to traffic congestion in the town and to

the need for a distributor road in Newcastle West.

Following a brief discussion, the importance of a distributor road for Newcastle West was

reiterated and reference was also made to lands which have been sterilised for many years.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the distributor road would most likely

be a developer led project which would form part of the Local Area Plan.---

The following items were also raised.

An update was sought on the Council owned derelict properties in Assumpta Park and

Sharwood Estate, Newcastle West. In replying, the Meetings Administrator stated that

confirmation had been sought from the Senior Engineer, LA Housing Construction and

Maintenance that works are to commence shortly in Sharwood Estate, Newcastle West.

An update on a detailed accident report at Dore’s Cross, Templeglantine, was also requested.

In replying, the Meetings Administrator stated that an update had been sought from the

Senior Executive Engineer, Roads who confirmed that a Meeting is to take place shortly with

Transport Infrastructure Ireland with regard to carrying out a safety review of the junction.

The Senior Executive Engineer circulated a map outlining plans to remove two loading bays,

removal of single parking bay and the installation of double yellow lines at Bishop Street,

Newcastle West. Following discussion, the Members agreed to the carrying out of these

works. However, it was pointed out by the Members that the new loading bay indicated on

the drawing was at a location that may create a traffic hazard. Therefore, it was agreed that

further consultation would take place with the Members on the location of a new loading bay

in Bishop Street, Newcastle West.

The Senior Executive Engineer also circulated a map outlining plans to install double yellow

lines at Bishop’s Court, Newcastle West. Following discussion, it was agreed that the

Meetings Administrator would seek further clarification on whether the installation of double

yellow lines was either a reserved or an executive function. In replying, the Senior Executive

Engineer indicated that he believed it was an executive function.

The Members referred to the level of violence and destruction which took place by gangs of

youths in Newcastle West on Halloween night and to the frightening scenes witnessed in the

town. A lengthy discussion followed and reference was made to a number of matters

including the lack of Garda resources, more Garda presence required on streets, the need for

a new Garda Station for Newcastle West, telephone lines at Newcastle West Garda Station

being diverted to Henry Street Garda Station from 9 p.m. daily, GDPR legislation regarding the

use of CCTV, requirement for CCTV evidence, parental responsibility and tenancy laws.

Reference was also made to an incident which took place in Abbeyfeale on Halloween night.

The Members also referred to the difficulty in getting new recruits to join the An Garda

Síochána and to existing members of the force leaving to change career paths.

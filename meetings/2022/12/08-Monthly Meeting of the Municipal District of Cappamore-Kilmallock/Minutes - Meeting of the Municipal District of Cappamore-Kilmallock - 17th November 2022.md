4.**Presentation on Criteria for Bus Shelters, Active Travel.**

The Executive Engineer of Active Travel with responsibility for Bus Shelters made a

presentation to the Elected Members in relation to the Criteria required for agreement and

installation of Bus Shelters.

Circulated Bus Shelter Presentation – Active Travel.

The Elected Members requested clarification on the following, and the responses have been

included:

**Question 1:** Would a school service count towards the minimum criteria for bus shelter

funding?

**Answer 1:** No, unfortunately, school services would not form part of the minimum criteria

as they are funded by the Department of Education and not the NTA.

**Question 2:** Would the NTA have any issues with local communities fund raising and

installing bus shelters on public land/space?
---
**Answer 2:** The NTA would not have an issue with this, but they could not take them in

charge. These shelters can cause maintenance issues post installation and the Local

Authority would have to give permission to install them.

Visibility of bus stops, and bus schedules being available at bus stops was also discussed. As

per the Notices of Motion below submitted by Councillors Teefy and Donegan, it was agreed

that correspondence be submitted to the National Transport Authority to request a review

of the services provided to the 329 Bus Route in light of the changing demographics of the

local population.

Cllr. O’Donovan welcomed the works on the N69 Mungret and Boland’s Cross. She was

disappointed that the Limerick Rathkeale Greenway might be in jeopardy due to Irish Rail and

that it is still with Community Tourism & Culture directorate and not TII. It is not just a tourist

attraction; it is about connectivity to Patrickswell and Limerick.

Cllr. Butler asked if the Rathkeale to Limerick City Greenway would be transferred to TII once it

connects to Limerick City and asked what is the agreed timeline for the scheme. He also asked

if the Cement factory line could be examined.

Cllr. Teefy acknowledged the great progress made. She referenced the Limerick to Cahir project

and asked if Cahir/Oola/Brooksbridge is the exact route. She agreed with Cllr. Secas in relation

to the traffic at the Mackey Roundabout and advised the issue has been raised with TII. She

asked for the presentations to be circulated.

Cllr. Leddin referenced the campaign regarding disused railway lines. He stated that the railway

network is one of our hidden gems and a line from Mungret by Ballykeefe and into the heart of

the city would be very positive. He expressed disappointment that there was no reference in

LSMATS to look at feasibility for potential routes for passengers. He added that it is a missed

opportunity and who is taking ownership of it. Mr. Kennedy, in response confirmed that

passenger rail was identified in LSMATS and the executive will continue to discuss this element

with the NTA.

The Chair acknowledged that it takes time in terms of greenways and would like to see more

connection with Clare and Shannon and that the railway lines would be used for light rail.

Cllr. Sheahan (M) wished to know if the Foynes to Limerick rail scheme would have sufficient

demand, taking into account the enhanced road services when the Adare bypass is completed.

Cllr. Mitchell asked if it is a good thing that Greenway schemes are transferred to TII. He

welcomed the Beary’s cross and Oola works on the N24, and the bypass of Tipperary town.

Cllr. Foley acknowledged the work at Wards cross. He asked when will the Abbeyfeale and

Newcastle West corridors be narrowed down. Mr. Fitzgerald confirmed that a design update for

both Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale is scheduled for Q1 2023.

Cllr. McSweeney thanked Mr. Fitzgerald for the informative presentation and stated the

extension of the greenway to Patrickswell and the City needs to be a priority. He particularly feels

that landowners in Patrickswell are in limbo as they cannot get planning permission for house or

extensions.---

In response to members Mr. Fitzgerald added the following:

-

He acknowledged the issues at the Mackey Roundabout.

-

He confirmed that TII is the approving authority for all Greenways since September 2021

and they have developed new guidance documents and procedures in relation to

Greenways.

-

The Black Bridge is not included in the UL to Montpelier scheme; it falls within the Limerick

to Scarriff scheme, which is being administered by Waterways Ireland and Clare County

Council.

-

He advised that it is difficult to give a timeline in relation to the Rathkeale to Limerick

Greenway, as currently working on the feasibility phase. National code of practice requires

the investigation of locating greenways on state-owned lands where possible.

-

In relation to the Cahir project, Mr. Fitzgerald stated that work was progressing to reduce

the 300m wide corridor identified in May 2022, and a design update was programmed to be

published in Quarter 2 2023.

-

In relation to the Foynes to Limerick rail scheme, Mr. Fitzgerald added that Foynes is a Core

Port and in accordance with EU TEN-T regulations, is to be served by high quality road and

freight rail line.

**Item 3: Proposed 30k Speed Limits in the core business district** **–Seamas O’Reilly, S.E.E.**

Mr. Seamas O’Reilly delivered a presentation on the proposed 30kp/h speed limits in the core

business district.

The members thanked Mr. O’Reilly and the Chair opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Mitchell referred to a recent Motion he submitted at the Cappamore Kilmallock District

Meeting. He welcomed the engineering measures in junction tightening and raised ramps. He

asked about the speed limit review.

Cllr. Secas agreed it is a great proposal and will make a big difference regarding road safety. She

asked about enforcement and if lower than 30kp/h was considered

In response to Cllr. Mitchell, Mr. O’Reilly confirmed that a number of submissions were received

and he will be managing the speed limit review and will be holding workshops. Mr. O’Reilly

confirmed that he is in consultation with An Garda Siochána regarding enforcement, and once

implemented, a speed survey will be undertaken, which will assist in informing LCCC of required

engineering measures. 30kp/h is the lowest available to the Local Authority.

The Chair stated she would agree the design and signaling is more important that the speed

limits. She asked if there were any other measures, like traffic management or circulation plans.

Mr. O’Reilly stated that at a number of locations, engineering measures may be deemed

necessary. It is currently a work in progress and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.---

Mr. Kennedy advised Bus Connects has started and traffic management will be part of the Bus

Connects project.

**Item 4: Health Benefits arising from implementation of a low noise road surface -**

**Mr. Simon Jennings, Executive Scientist**

Mr. Kennedy introduced Mr. Simon Jennings to deliver presentation and acknowledged his

experience in the area of noise monitoring.

Mr. Jennings delivered the presentation and described how works in the area between Junction

28 and 30 were completed for the TII under a pilot project. The project is designed to inform the

development of TII policy for addressing road traffic noise issues on the national road network.

The Chair thanked Mr. Jennings for the presentation and added that Environment and Transport

are intrinsically linked and she welcomed the road surface noise reduction. She asked if a paper

would be published from this research and if a reduction in speed reduces noise. She also asked

if reduction in speed limits in certain periods would be effective.

Cllr. Secas acknowledged the work of Mr. Jennings and team, adding that this work was

introduced 7 to 8 years ago and it was a long process to get to this point today. She acknowledged

TII and thanked them for listening and providing funding. She asked if it would be possible to

monitor the impact of noise level over next couple of months.

Cllr. McSweeney asked about the scheme for Glencairn and Belgard Grove. Cllr. Sheahan (M)

thanked Mr. Jennings for his enthusiasm and professionalism.

Cllr. Ryan enquired about the change in materials from HRA to SMA and what is the change in

friction and stopping distance.

Cllr. Butler referenced the WHO Health impacts and agreed the results are very encouraging.

In relation to Glencairn, he expressed his disappointment at the lack of information. 30-40

residents, close to the motorway have received no communication or update and this now needs

action.

Mr. Harper referenced the UK Noise Association, adding that the reduction in speed is the

cheapest way to reduce noise. He asked if a reduction to 30 kp/h will have an effect on noise.

Cllr Mitchell raised the following queries:-

1. Should Noise Mitigation be introduced in future residential developments

2. What type of fencing would help reduce noise.

Mr. Jennings thanked the members for their questions and added the following: ----
5

In relation to a published paper, a report on the M7 is completed, which looks at various

mitigation measures. With regard to applying periodic speed limits, he has not seen any applied

in the Irish context to reduce impact of noise.

TII in recent weeks has carried out surveys and will be in a position to compare and measure

output of noise to monitor the impact.

In response to Cllr Mc Sweeney, Mr. Jennings confirmed that he has completed a report on

Glencairn and Ballycummin hotspot and also Patrickswell. He understands the areas are works in

progress. He added that Cost benefit Assessment is completed for the Ballycummin hotspot and

was prepared at the same time as the Monaleen (M7) hotspot

In response to Cllr. Butler, Mr. Jennings confirmed that he has been updating residents and

working to get TII to move on the Glencairn project. He is speaking to residents where he has

carried out noise monitoring. Mr. Kennedy also advised that he will liaise with Mr. Jennings to

work closely with TII.

Mr. Jennings added that a reduced speed to 30kp/h in the core business district will most likely

have a positive effect on reducing environmental noise and he will be undertaking noise

modelling again in the future

There are currently no national guidelines in relation to the construction of new residential

developments. TII has responsibility for the Technical guidance in relation to materials. Mr.

Jennings confirmed that barriers need to be of sufficiently high density material with no gaps

along their length.

The Chair thanked Mr. Jennings for his expertise and stated that he would be welcome to future

SPC Meetings.

**Item 5: Update on LSMATS** **–** **Mr. Brian Kennedy, D.O.S.**

Mr. Kennedy delivered an update and confirmed that LSMATS is approved by the board of the

NTA and is now with Minister Malcolm Noonan for 6 weeks. It is anticipated that the final

document will be published by the end of November 2022.

Cllr. Secas expressed disappointment at the omission of the LNDR. Cllr. McSweeney concurred

and added that it is disappointing that there is no mention of cycle connects at this SPC. Cycle

connect is out to public consultation and there has been no briefing or engagement with

members. The closing date is the 11th November 2022.

Mr. Kennedy confirmed that the Minister of Transport made the decision to exclude LDNR and

he assumed this continues to be the case. He added that the Executive agrees it is important to

the region. He will bring the comments on cycle connects to the NTA.---

Cllr. O’Donovan agreed with Cllr. McSweeney and added that there is no consistency between

cycle lane schemes and referenced the S.C.R. / Fr. Russell Road scheme. She asked what the plan

was with regard to Part 8’s and what traffic surveys are being done at present.

Cllr. Mitchell concurred with Cllr Mc Sweeney, adding that the LNDR is an important piece of

infrastructure and was unanimously decided on by the Members.

Mr. Kennedy advised that the LSMATS is a strategic document and has more emphasis on

networks as opposed to schemes. In relation to the connectivity of cycle schemes, the LSMATS

will connect all schemes that the Council has been working on through the Pathfinder project.

Cllr. McSweeney thanked Mr. Kennedy adding that this is really important. He asked what

mechanism is used to connect the LNDR. Mr. Kennedy stated that the proposed congestion

improvement works on the Corbally Road and on Junction 28 are all in an effort to progress into

the future.

The Chair welcomed the strategy. She added that the omission of the LNDR does not diminish

other works and we need to keep the focus on Active Travel and Public Transport.

**Item 6: Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. S. Benson (referred from Full Council Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council consider the introduction of specifically

designated autism parking spots outside the Dóchas Centre in Parnell Street, Limerick, and that

this Council work with ASD Ireland with a view to identifying other suitable locations across the

city and county.

In proposing the Motion, Cllr. Benson stated that Autism friendly parking is required for people

with additional needs. 130 children are using the facilities at the Dóchas Centre for speech and

drama classes etc. and parking is required.

Cllr. Collopy seconded the Motion adding he is wholeheartedly in support. The Chair and Cllr.

Mitchell also supported the Motion. The Chair referenced Waterford where autism parking

spots are identified.

**Reply:**

In a recent written response by the Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan it was advised

that there is no authorised Disabled Parking Badge specifically relating to autism. This creates a

difficulty when considering the introduction of specific parking spots in this regard.

We reviewed best practice elsewhere and are aware of arrangements in place in some locations,

which are dependent on an honesty policy for effective operation. The system involves marking

a specific parking area with a recognised hidden disability emblem and depends on user honesty

for subsequent parking on this spot.---
7

It should be noted that that this is a very busy city centre location with paid parking. We will liaise

with ASD Ireland and the local Dóchas Centre to gauge their views on the matter and determine

a course of action following these discussions.

Cllr. Benson welcomed that the Council will engage with ASD and the local Dóchas Centre and

was satisfied with the response.

**Item 7:** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Ryan (referred from**

**Cappamore/Kilmallock MD Meeting)**

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that the use of

averaging Speed cameras in towns and villages be considered in the Municipal District where

speed is a concern.

In proposing the Motion, Cllr. Ryan stated that speed is a concern and suggested a pilot project

would encourage motorists to be more alert going through towns and villages.

Cllr. Teefy seconded the Motion and suggested looking at a pilot on certain sections of road of

the R513. Cllr. Mitchell concurred with Cllr. Teefy and fully supported the Motion.

**Reply:**

The Average Speed Safety Camera System is governed by an agreement under Section 81 (7) of

the Road Traffic Act, 2010, entered into between An Garda Siochana, the Dept. of Justice and

Transport Infrastructure Ireland. A pilot was launched on March 8th on the M7 in Tipperary

between Junction 26 (Nenagh West) and Junction 27 (Birdhill) to commence installation and

testing of an Average Speed Safety Camera System. The operation of the system is very complex

from a data handling perspective and is still under evaluation by An Garda Siochána and the Dept.

of Justice at this Co. Tipperary site. Note that a similar system has been in operation in Dublin

Tunnel and has resulted in a reduction in speeding incidents by about 80% in the Tunnel.

However, it should be noted that both of the above locations have a defined speed measuring

entry point and a defined speed measuring exit point, with no entry or exit points in between.

Essentially, traffic entering the system have no choice but to continue on to exit point, which

means that the averaging system will get an accurate reading of the speed of the vehicle as it,

traverses this defined path.

This requirement is not replicated in a typical town/village scenario where, invariably, there will

be multiple exit/entry/destination or speed interruption points between the sampling points in

question. Consequently, there could be no confidence that the system will give an accurate

representation of the vehicles speed because of this likelihood of exposure to journey

interruptions along the route.

Cllr. Ryan stated that many local residents in Abbington Murroe area of the R516 have raised

concerns in relation to speeding. In response, Mr. Kennedy added that the Council will write to---
8

the Department of Justice on the matter. Cllr Ryan stated that it was important to keep

working on the issue and he welcomed the response.

**Item 8:** **Notice of Motion submitted by Mr. Dean Lillis**

We move to ask Limerick City and County Council to write to the Road Safety Authority to revise

the content of the Category B Essential Driver Training syllabus and the Category B Approved

Driving Instructor Training syllabus to result in greater awareness of the illegality of parking on

any footpath and/or footway, as per *Article 36(i) of S.I. No. 182/1997 - Road Traffic (Traffic and*

*Parking) Regulations, 1997*.

In proposing the Motion, Mr. Lillis on behalf of the Community / Voluntary PPN Representatives

stated that the Road Traffic Regulations 1997 makes no reference to parking on footpaths. As an

approved driving instructor himself, he requested that explicit reference should be made to

parking on footpaths in the essential driver and driving instructor training syllabuses.

Cllr. Ryan seconded the Motion. He confirmed that the Step Forward Disability Group, delivered

a presentation at a recent Municipal District Meeting, at which they outlined the obstacles on

footpaths which make it difficult for people with disabilities. He added that it would be well

worth getting them to do a presentation at this SPC.

Cllr. Teefy supported the Motion adding she is very familiar with Step Forward Group who outline

the challenges for people with buggies, wheelchairs and who are visual impaired.

Cllr. Secas supported the Motion adding that parking on footpaths was discussed at the Metro

meeting. She referenced cars parked on footpaths on both sides of road can cause an obstruction

to emergency services. She stated that education, enforcement and awareness will help to a

certain degree. Cllr. Mitchell agreed with Cllr. Secas adding that there was consistent traffic

congestion in Hospital. Other issues need to be address like the provision of car parks.

The Chair supported the Motion adding that the underlying cause is not addressed and a strategic

approach is required as there are many layers. It requires deeper thinking, i.e. examining fines

and enforcement. Maybe a special meeting with An Gardai Siochána and stakeholders may be

required.

**Reply:**

The Council will write to the Road Safety Authority to revise the content of the Category B

Essential Driver Training syllabus and the Category B Approved Driving Instructor Training

syllabus.

Mr. Lillis thanked Mr. Kennedy for the reply

The Chair advised that the next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, the 20th December 2022.

The meeting then concluded.---

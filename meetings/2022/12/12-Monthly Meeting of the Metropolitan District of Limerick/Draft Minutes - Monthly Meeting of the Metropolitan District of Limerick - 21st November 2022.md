numerous footpaths.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***place with the NTA regarding the additional bus lane in O'Connell Street.***

**REPLY:** The NTA has recently appointed specialised transport designers, Jarrett Walker & Associates

review of the existing bus network across the Metropolitan area and developing initial

drafts for the future bus networks, which will be based on Limerick Shannon Metropolitan

Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS), land zoning and predicted demand areas. Indications

from the NTA are that the LSMATS will be published by the end of November.

Limerick City and County Council will be fully engaged with the NTA in the review of the

proposed draft routes. It must also be noted there will be full public consultation associated

with Bus Connects in Limerick.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Director responsible***

***could provide leaf-cleaning schedule for the City area.***

**REPLY:** The rate of leaf fall is heavily dependent on current weather conditions with larger falls of

leaves occurring during windy conditions or following frosts. The use of a fixed schedule is

not effective and a more reactive approach is required to maximise the benefits of leaf

sweeping. Public roads are continuously assessed for leaf fall and to decide the assignment

of available resources. The Council gives additional attention to areas where large amounts

of leaf fall are a regular occurrence.---

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***commitment given to my motion on litter bin tagging system in 2020, in particularly for the***

***update on the options that were planned to be considered [including a tagging system that will***

***improve the current service by providing appropriate information that will inform the delivery of***

***a more efficient litter bin service for the Metropolitan area].***

**REPLY:** While a QR code system would allow the public to scan a QR code and report any issues

they may encounter, telemetry fitted to litter bins provides better and real time

information. The Council’s CRM system remains an option for any member of the public

wishing to make a complaint about any litterbin. Following the previous notice of motion,

the inclusion of telemetry was incorporated into the procurement of solar powered

compacting bins. This telemetry informs the Cleansing Team when a bin is full or has been

emptied. It assists in making the servicing of litterbins more efficient. To date 76 solar bins

with this technology have been fitted, 6 of these are part of the O’Connell Street

refurbishment and a further 24 solar bins will be installed on O’Connell Street. when the

project is completed. As more solar powered bins are installed in future, they will also have

the technology to provide real time information to the Cleansing Team.

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on when***

***benches will be installed in Vartry Field.***

**REPLY:** At present, there are no plans to install benches in the Vartry Field. Any proposals to install

benches at Vartry Field would require consultation with local residents.

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a detailed update of the***

***landscaping scheme for the O'Connell Street revitalisation project including where and when***

locations of all proposed raised and long planters and tree pits. There are twenty four raised

box planters within the scheme, there are four long planters on the scheme at the four

corners of the Thomas St / Bedford Row junction and there are five tree pits on the scheme,

***fencing will be removed on Parnell Street and Hartstonge Street which has been there for over a***

***year as the fencing is causing obstructions to footpaths.***

***Transport*** ***Authority requesting the introduction of a new faster direct bus service linking Raheen***

***Dooradoyle to UL via Childers Road to accommodate growing population now living in the area.***

In the absence of Councillor Leddin and with his permission, the Notice of Motion was proposed

by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kilcoyne stated that this issue had been raised regularly and a

more direct bus route to UL should be considered, particularly at peak traffic times. Members also

noted that the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) was also

imminent and that the motion was timely in relation to this strategy.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council writes to the management of each of the major shopping Centre’s and retail parks***

***to ask them to provide secure bicycle storage at their premises.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor O’Donovan

and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) referred to the increase in popularity in cycling,

with improved Active Travel infrastructure, and the need for secure bicycle storage at shopping

centres and retail parks. The Members welcomed the Motion and agreed it was important to

support more cyclists and ensuring the security of their bicycles and equipment.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council write to Waterways Ireland to ask them to come before the next Metropolitan***

***meeting to answer questions about the deterioration of the Guinness canal between the city***

***centre and UL and to outline the management plans they have for the canal.***---
10

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan

and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) stated that the Canal was widely used by runners

and walkers and required urgent upgrading. Members complimented Limerick Civic Trust on their

great work in maintaining the Canal in the past and agreed that it was important to make contact

with Waterways Ireland so as clarify their role and responsibility in relation to the proper

maintenance of the canal.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors C. Slattery, K. O’Hanlon and J. Pond**

***We will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council again***

***write to Minister McEntee and ask her to reconsider her decision to transfer Logan Jackson to the***

***UK.***

The Cathaoirleach confirmed that this Notice of Motion had been withdrawn.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this District (Limerick***

***Metropolitan) require all active travel schemes, involving the provision of segregated cycle lanes,***

***where the project value exceeds €127,000 be progressed through the full Part 8 planning process***

***as set out in Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, in the interest of proper***

***planning and development.***

Councillor McSweeney proposed the Notice of Motion and stated that the figure should be

amended to €126,000. The Motion was seconded by Councillor Kiely and agreed.

Councillor McSweeney noted the important work carried out by the Active Travel Department and

highlighted the importance of consultation with Members and the public in relation to active travel

schemes. He cited instances where some projects were not subject to the same level of public

consultation measures, in comparison with others. Some Members also agreed that a Part 8

application gave the Elected Members greater input into the decision making process.

The members raised a number of points, as follows:-

 Members were not clear on the distinction and process between Section 38 and Part 8 and

agreed that this needed to be clarified as there seemed to be inconsistencies in the

treatment of projects, and the written reply to the Motion did not provide the clarity being

sought;

 Members agreed that it was difficult for the public to know where details of Section 38

schemes could be obtained and queried whether they could be listed on the Planning

Enquiry system to facilitate people’s queries on these projects;

 Members noted that Section 38 provides that a Road Authority may provide traffic calming

measures, but that there was no obligation to always use Section 38;

 Concern was expressed about the ease of access to the Active Travel team and the need for

improved communication from the team, as members of the public were not clear re

locations where they could meet with Active Travel so as to make submissions on schemes;

 Members agreed that Section 38 could be considered appropriate to use in certain---
11

circumstances, but not for segregated cycle lanes in accordance with the adopted motion.

**REPLY**: Active Travel schemes fall under Local Authority own development and as such section 179

– Local Authority own development of the Planning and Development Act (as amended)

applies.

Section 179(1) refers to ‘prescribed’ forms of development or classes of development that

are set out in section 80(1) of the Planning and Development Regulations (as amended).

Section 80(1) lists forms of development that if proposed by the local authority must go

through the Part 8 planning process. Section 80(1)(k) of the regulations refers to

development the cost of which exceeds €126,000.

However, section 179(6)(bb) of the Planning and Development Act (as amended) states that

section 179 and any accompanying regulations shall not apply to proposed development

which consists of works, other than works involving road widening, under section 38 of the

Road Traffic Act (1994).

As such, works proposed or carried out under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act are exempt

from the Part 8 planning process and regardless of the cost of the works or if the cost

exceeds €126,000, do not have to go through the Part 8 process.

Members agreed that the reply to the Motion was not very clear and that further discussion and

clarification was required. The Members welcomed the proposal that a Workshop would be

organised in January 2023, which will clarify the issues that were raised.

**30.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this District write to***

***Micheál Martin outlining the urgent need for the allocation of additional funding to recruit the***

***additional staff required to deliver affordable housing within our City and County.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor McSweeney, seconded by Councillor Kiely and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor McSweeney stated that affordable housing had been delivered

in other parts of the country with little affordable housing delivered to date in Limerick. He

highlighted the urgent need for additional staffing resources to deliver affordable housing in

Limerick in a timely manner. Members supported the motion.

**31.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

**32.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that an invitation be sent***

***and timetables.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor McSweeney and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kiely stated that there was no bus service to the Hyde Road

area after 7pm and she highlighted the difficulties this caused for residents. Councillor Sheehan (C)

proposed that the motion be amended to include the 305 bus service to St. Mary’s Park. This was

**33.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***connecting Westbury with the city.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir, seconded by Councillor

Hartigan and agreed.

**34.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir, seconded by Councillor

O’Sullivan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir stated that the provision of sustainable

travel infrastructure in Business Parks would facilitate employees to switch to sustainable modes

by Active Travel.---

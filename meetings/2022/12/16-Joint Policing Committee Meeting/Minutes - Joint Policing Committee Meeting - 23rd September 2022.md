The Chairman stated he had recently attended a Meeting of Chairpersons of Joint Policing

out a pilot JPC in certain areas and it was intended to reduce the membership of Councillors

on the Committee from 14 to 7. It was also proposed that the Minister for Justice would

appoint the Chairperson. He stated that the Joint Policing Committee in Limerick was working

well and he expressed concern in relation to these proposals. He also stressed the importance

of the representation by Elected Members of their areas across a wide geographical spread

to ensure balanced representation. It was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would

write to the Minister conveying the concerns of the JPC Members regarding the proposed

changes.---
As part of a general discussion, Members discussed the following issues:

 Anti-social behavior in the Askeaton area and the need for an enhanced Garda presence;

 Lack of legislation to deal with offenders under the age of 18;

 Delays in dealing with Members of An Garda Siochana in the Mid-West area who were

currently suspended;

 Plans to increase Garda numbers with projected rise in population in the future.

The Chief Superintendent responded to the issues discussed. He confirmed that were

managing Garda resources having regard to the various demands across the county. He

confirmed that those under 18 that the Juvenile Liaison scheme was in place to deal with

offenders, along with other agencies including Tusla, the HSE, etc. He explained that he could

not discuss any issues relating to individual Garda personnel in the Mid-West region, as this

was ongoing. Finally, he confirmed that he had regular discussions with the Garda

Commissioner and senior Garda management regarding staffing and resources for the

Limerick area.

The Members agreed that more deterrents were needed to tackle underage criminal activity

and anti-social behavior, including making parents more accountable, improved inter agency

co-operation, and other possible measures to tackle it.

**2.UPDATE FROM CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT**

The Chief Superintendent referred to the opening up of society post Covid 19, that crime

figures had increased in some areas, and the Gardai were monitoring activity accordingly.

**3.OVERVIEW ON CRIME STATISTICS FROM SENIOR CRIME AND POLICING ANALYST**

Ms. L. Collins, Senior Crime and Policing Analyst gave a brief statistical overview of current

crime statistics.

Copy of presentation would be circulated to all Members after the meeting.

The Chief Superintendent stated that overall, that assaults were up 55% and in some cases,

Gardai were not receiving formal complaints from the public. He confirmed there was an

increase in crime statistics in many areas with the opening up of society and this trend was

similar nationally. Increases in alcohol and drug abuse were also issues that were of concern.

The Chief Superintendent stated that there were 8 fatal collisions to date in 2022 and this was

a concern.

Members noted the increase in domestic abuse incidents and the importance of Operation

Sabhalta and agencies working together and the need for further resources in this area.

The Chairman and Members extended good wishes to Inspector Niall Flood who had been

injured in a recent accident and wished him well in his recovery.---
**4.UPDATE ON GARDA OPERATING FUNCTIONAL MODEL**

The Chief Superintendent outlined details of changes to the Limerick Garda Division, arising

from the phased implementation of An Garda Síochána’s Operating Model. The Limerick

Division was one of six pilot areas.

He stated, the Operating Model is a key element of the transformation programme “A Policing

Service for our Future”. The Operating Model is restructuring Divisions to put community

policing at the centre of the Division. Each Division will be comprised of four Functional Areas:

Community Engagement, Crime, Performance Assurance and Business Services. The crime

section would be dealt with by the Limerick Crime Unit at Henry Street. Each Functional Area

is led by a Superintendent, with the exception of the Business Services Functional Area, which

is led by an Assistant Principal.

**5.UPDATE ON TOTAL ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS WITHIN THE LIMERICK DIVISION AND**

**PLANS BEING PUT IN PLACE TO PREVENT THESE**

Road Deaths Limerick Division 2022

The year 2021 saw a historically low numbers of road deaths in Ireland with 130 people losing

their lives nationally. There has been an increase nationally in road deaths for 2022 with 112

road deaths this year so far which is an increase of 11 from 2021. To date there have been 11

fatal road traffic collisions in Limerick Division to date with 12 people losing their lives. The

breakdown is as follows:

Drivers Deceased: 6

Passengers Deceased: 3

Motorcyclists: 2

Pedestrians: 1

One of the collisions was a double fatality where both driver and passenger in the same

vehicle were killed. While all collisions are currently under investigation, there is an indication

that a number will be a matter for the Coroners Court only, including some of the collisions,

which were single vehicle, single occupant fatal collisions.

While this year on year comparison can be seen as an increase, historic data indicates that

there has been a marked downward trend of road deaths in Limerick where there were 23

deaths in Limerick in 2009 with 18 losing their lives the following year.---

**11.QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MAURICE QUINLIVAN, T.D.**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a progress re**port on operation ‘Operation Copóg’, how it***

***is progressing and is there an anticipated end date***

**RESPONSE**:

Operation Copóg was a dual operation with Community Policing stationed at Mayorstone

Park and Garda members from the Drugs and Crime Unit. The Operation was established to

target the sale and supply of controlled drugs and money laundering offence in the St. Mary’s

Park area of Limerick City. As part of this operation, a High Visibility Policing and Community

Engagement initiative was established in St Mary’s Park.

The Operation officially closed on the 4th of September as per the direction of Supt Sugrue in

line with the beginning of the Operating Model. As part of its closure an additional

community Garda was allocated to St Mary’s Park increasing its number to 4 Gardai.

All Operations within An Garda Síochána are reviewed continually to avoid complacency and

to identify new challenges and progress that can be made.

Operation Croi has since been established in Limerick City Centre focusing on Thefts, Thefts

from Shop and the sale and supply of controlled drugs in the city centre.

**12.QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MAURICE QUINLIVAN, T.D.**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the establishment of the proposed multi***

***agency mental health de-escalation unit, outlining what training has commenced and when***

***the proposed unit is due to be operational”. –*** ***CAST Project***

**RESPONSE:**

A Project Proposal document was submitted and approved by the HSE. The proposal contains

a framework of a pre-pilot and a follow up fulltime pilot, including resources and projected

costings. A Project Initiation document was developed - defining the project scope,

management, and overall success criteria for the project for consideration by the Joint-

Steering Group.

Pending sign-off from both agencies, progressing the advertising and selection of key posts

(Project manager, senior social worker, Sergeant An Garda Síochána) would mean a pre-pilot

commencement date in 2023*.*

The other element of the pilot which will require significant planning is training. Various

modules and content have been identified. However, a significant amount of work needs to

be completed in developing a training programme with our HSE partners.

**Next Steps**: The Completion of Pre-initiation documentation is the next key step which sets

out the strategy for implementation. It is currently at an advanced stage. Central to

implementation is the appointment of key full time positions.---

33---
In proposing the motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted serious incidents that had occurred

on the bridges and the damage that was caused to vehicles. She stated that Gardai should be

patrolling the area regularly to prevent anti-social behaviour.

The Notice of Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins (B) and agreed.

**RESPONSE**:

Gardai are investigating a large number of Criminal Damage incidents that occurred on

Thursday 15/9 and Friday 16/9 in the Kilmallock Road Roundabout, Ballysimon Road and

Childers Road area. There was damage caused to passing cars, busses and trains between

19:00hrs and 22:00hrs on those dates. A number of youths gained access to the railway line

and threw large stones from the railway bridges resulting in the damage. This type of activity

has been seen in the past but not for some time and not in as large a scale as this past week.

Gardaí have being liaising with Iarnród Eireann in an effort to detect these offences and

prevent future offences. Gardaí have increased patrols in the area and are monitoring the

situation closely.

**15.NOTICE OF MOTION SUBMITTED BY COUNCILLOR SEAN HARTIGAN**

***I will move at the next meeting that Garda resources are provided to deal with dangerous***

***parking, which is causing serious problems for residents of estates surrounding the***

***University of Limerick, with potential to result in loss of life should emergency vehicles not***

***be able to gain access***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan. He highlighted the incidents of

illegal parking in the housing estates surrounding the University of Limerick and the difficulties

caused for the elderly and people with buggies, as cars were parked on footpaths. He stated

bin collection lorries and other vehicles had difficulty accessing the area.

The Motion was seconded by Deputy Brian Leddin, T.D., and agreed.

**RESPONSE**:

The Community Policing Office have been actively addressing illegal parking issues, firstly

through the UL discipline office and by engagement, information on illegal parking, fines,

penalty points etc. have been circulated in message format to the student population through

student life contacts. We are now moving into an enforcement mode in an effort to curb the

most serious parking.

A comprehensive policing plan has been put in place for fresher’s week which has been

sanctioned by the Chief Superintendent Limerick and will begin on the 25th of September

2022. That plan is in addition to the regular and now increased policing of the estates that is

currently taking place.---
As part of that plan the Limerick Roads Policing Unit have altered their MIT checkpoints to

bolster the policing presence in the Castletroy area and especially on Plassey Park road and

adjoining estates. AGS are expecting students to arrive into that area from all over the

country for Limerick fresher’s week and we intend to continue to liaise, educate, promote

proper behaviour regarding traffic, parking and anti-social behaviour, and we will be enforcing

the road traffic laws, which will include seizing vehicles where dangerous obstruction is

encountered.

**OTHER BUSINESS**

The Chairman asked Members who were interested in being part of Sub Committees on Roads

Policing and Public Order to contact the Meetings Administrator.

This concluded the business of the Meeting.

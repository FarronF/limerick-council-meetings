The former Convent of Mercy in Abbeyfeale is on the market for sale by the owner. As it

to the Notice of Motion. He also referred to the Old Convent of Mercy building in Abbeyfeale

matters including future use of the building, history associated with the building and

protected structure status of the building.

In replying, the Director stated that the Old Convent of Mercy building is currently an active

derelict sites case and that the removal of the protected structure status from the building

regard to this property.

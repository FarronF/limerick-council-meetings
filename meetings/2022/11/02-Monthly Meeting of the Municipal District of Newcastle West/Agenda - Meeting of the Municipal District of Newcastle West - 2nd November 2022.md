QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the footpath from Healy's bend up to
Fitzgerald’s farmhouse, Abbeyfeale.

| will ask at the next Meeting (a) What year was the footpath replaced at Donoghue’s
up to the Greyhound and Pet World, Abbeyfeale (b)What was the cost at the time (c)
Can this path be repaired again (d) Do the Council consider this value for money.

Questions submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

| will ask at the next Meeting when will the system of locking and opening of the
Mass Path gate be implemented as agreed? The Council were to open in the

morning, the neighbours were to close at night. This was due to the automatic
opening and closing device being disabled.

| will ask at the next Meeting when will traffic safety measures in the Glebe estate,
Monagea take place? A narrowing of the wide entrance was discussed to reduce the
speed into the estate. The residents have previously signed a petition for ramps or
alternative safety measures.

| will ask at the next Meeting can grass and weeds be cut at the back of Aldi facing
the tennis courts. | think there is a covered pipe here.

Questions submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will ask at the next Meeting when safety measures will be undertaken at the
junction of the L7029 with the R515.

| will ask at the next Meeting when appropriate measures are likely to be put in place
to enable traffic to safely enter and exit from L21018 onto the N21 at Barnagh.

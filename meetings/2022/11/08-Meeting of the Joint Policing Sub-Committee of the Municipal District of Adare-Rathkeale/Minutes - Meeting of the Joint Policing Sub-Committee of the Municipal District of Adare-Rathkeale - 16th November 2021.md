report suspicious activity and to lock up their possessions. She further stated that criminal

assaults are down throughout the District with an increase in minor assaults in the Croom

area. In addition, she advised the Gardaí are unable to follow through on these crimes

unless a statement is made.---
Detective Sergeant Reidy advised there are a number of operations in place at the

moment to target criminal drug activity in the District and further advised there has been

a huge effort made in combatting drug crimes with the assistance of the Bruff Drugs Unit

and the Regional Support Officers from the Dublin unit. Discussion ensued and Members

referred to the availability of drugs within the community and stated parents should take

responsibility to educate their children. Superintendent Magner advised education is key

in relation to drug use and they are rolling out drug information talks in schools at the

moment.

The Superintendent referred to two fatal road traffic collisions which occurred in the

District resulted in the death of three people. All present extended their condolences to

volunteers including member of An Garda Síochána and aims to help families who have

seriously and critically ill children.

The Superintendent advised they are rolling out a Garda clinic in Askeaton as a pilot

project, with the help of West Limerick Resources and other stakeholders. They intend to

The Deputy Mayor opened the meeting by welcoming the Members who were present in the

chamber and online for the meeting. He stated that the Special Meeting had been convened

to discuss the issue as set out in the proposal received on 12th October, 2022, and signed by

a number of Members as follows:

**“To discuss proposed Land Tax and all issues related to the matter”.**

**Signed: Councillors E. Ryan, J Scanlan, L. Galvin, B. Collins, J. Sheahan, S. Keary**

Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning gave a presentation on the Residential Zoned

Land Tax (RZLT), outlining the key items from the Guidelines for Planning Authorities, for

consideration as follows:

 The need to activate residential development land for housing in a timely manner, to

meet the Housing For All plan;---

 RZLT was announced in Budget 2022 and is part of the Finance Act 2021;

 Each local authority will prepare and publish a map identifying land within the scope

of RZLT;

 First maps must be published by 1st November 2022;

 Tax operated through revenue system to replace Vacant Site Levy (VSL), and noted

there will be further amendments to finance act this year, and next year, in relation

to transition of VSL;

 Annual tax calculated at 3% of the market value of the lands;

 RZLT comes into effect in February 2024 which gives a two year lead in for land within

the scope as of 1st January 2022.

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning, highlighted the criteria in which land is

considered ‘In Scope’, and liable for Residential Zoned Land Tax:

 Land must be zoned in a Development Plan or Local Area Plan solely or primarily for

residential use, or for a mixture of uses, including residential, which are currently

vacant or idle.

 Land must be services and have access to or be connected to public infrastructure and

facilities, which include roads, footpaths, public lighting, water supply and services,

including sewers and drainage.

She noted that this tax applies to all areas within each Local Authority, and is applicable to

public, semi state and private bodies, as well as individuals.

The Members agreed there is a need for development in order to address the housing crisis

in Ireland, but expressed concern over the residential zoned land tax, and did not feel it would

speed up the development process. They referred to the cost of development on landowners,

the cost of housing and the difficulty for first time buyers to secure a Mortgage, noting that

these all had an effect on developing land. They expressed concern about the 3% tax on

market value of land, and the effect that would have on larger vacant sites. It was the view

of some Members that the Land Tax would drive up cost of development land, while others

disagreed and felt it would have a positive effect on cost of developing houses.

Members queried if land is listed on the derelict sites register is it subject to the proposed

land tax, and if land owners wished to rezone their land to non-residential would they be in a

position to that. They also asked, if land adjoining the owner’s place of residence is zoned

residential, will that land be subject to the proposed tax. Some Members noted that they

needed to wait and see what is included in the map to know what is within the scope of these

proposals and that it was premature to be meeting about this until the information was

published and could be considered. Members also queried whether moneys raised from this

proposed tax would be retained for use locally or go directly to the Exchequer.

In response to the Members queries, Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning,

informed them that landowners may make a submission to the local authority to exclude land

from the map, or alternatively may also make a submission to include land which is not shown

on a map. She outlined that landowners can apply for referral, and noted there are 16

settlements in Limerick City and County identified as meeting criteria for the Land Tax which---

will be displayed in the map from 1st November 2022. The Senior Planner stated that if the

land is listed on the derelict sites register, it is not ‘In Scope’ and not subject to RZLT.

Proposed by Councillor Liam Galvin

Seconded by Councillor Eddie Ryan

To move at this meeting that this local authority call on the Minister for Housing to amend

the proposed tax on residential zoned land to the following:

“If an attempt to purchase Qualified residential zoned land at the market value on the

day is refused by the property owner, that the tax be implemented on the said property for

that year and subsequent years, until such time as the said property is either de-zoned or

developed, and that active farmed land be exempt”

Members thanked the Deputy Mayor for holding the Special Meeting, and thanked the

officials for their detailed presentation.

This concluded the meeting.

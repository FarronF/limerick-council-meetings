was Chairperson of this Taskforce, given his previous track record in industry. The Members

agreed that the deep-water estuary and Shannon Foynes Port was very important and they

referred to the imbalance of air traffic into Dublin Airport and the rest of the country, and

agreed that the potential of Shannon Airport needed to be realised in order to develop the

whole region.

Planning, Environment and Place-Making

Land Development Agency

The Mayor welcomed representatives from the Land Development Agency who gave a

PowerPoint presentation update on the Land Development Agency to the Members. This

presentation outlined how the Land Development Agency had a current staffing compliment
---

of 68 and had capital commitments of €500m for 2022 with sites in Shanaganagh, Dublin

and St Kevin’s, Cork totalling 862 homes which were the first Land Development Agency

projects commencing construction in 2022. They confirmed that the LDA current site

portfolio entailed 10 sites across Ireland comprising 6,000 homes, which were at planning

application/development stage. With regard to Limerick, they confirmed that the Colbert

Quarter Site was at the Spatial Framework stage.

Under Housing for All they outlined details of lands being transferred to the LDA which are

appropriate for housing and that have been drawn from across State bodies. In the case of

many of the lands, they confirmed that the relevant State bodies are already actively

engaged with the LDA, including considering the wider urban development of areas.

They outlined the details of the Register of Relevant Land, which is a public web map,

housed on the LDA website, showing all Relevant Public Lands as per Section 50 of the LDA

Act 2021 and that 21,952 hectares of public lands have been identified as being relevant as

per the LDA Act. The launch of the Register of Relevant Lands would take place in Quarter 4

2022.

Details of the Home Building Partnership (Project Tosaigh) were explained with it being

launched in November 2021 as part of Housing for All across the Greater Dublin Area and

the 5 regional cities. This entailed a forward purchasing arrangement for 5,000 homes over

the life of the project. It was a mixture of cost rental and affordable purchase aimed at mid-

market.

Information on the Colbert Quarter Spatial Framework was also explained and the following

points were highlighted:

 Scale, complexity & challenge with delivering a site like Colbert including current

and future operational uses, closed off, brownfield, infrastructure deficits and

barriers etc.;

 Limerick Council’s Housing Delivery Action Plan includes estimates for Affordable

and Social Housing delivery: Estimates included for LDA for period 2022-2026 –c 150

Affordable Purchase & 200 Cost Rental homes;

 Timing for delivery of homes heavily dependent on planning process and delays and

challenges are a current reality;

 Strategic Oversight/Advisory Group & Working Group established May 2022 to

advise & supporting strategic development in Limerick;

 Memorandum of Understanding signed by LDA and LCCC in September 2022

agreeing to work together to secure the development of the Guinness site as

envisioned in the CQSF;

 Infrastructure Phasing & Delivery Plan underway which refers to the importance of

delivering key infrastructure to assist in unlocking the development potential and

facilitate wider regeneration;

 Detailed Masterplan for HSE lands also underway offer the potential for phased

delivery of compact affordable housing delivery.

Other key updates included:

-Confirmation that the LDA planned to open a Limerick office in Quarter 4 2022;

-Ongoing due diligence in respect of Gas Networks Ireland site, O’Curry Street;

-Ongoing discussions with LCCC & Limerick 2030 regarding housing delivery on other sites;

-LDA are finalising report on relevant public land, which will seek to identify a pipeline of

other housing and regeneration opportunity sites in Limerick;

-LDA are exploring opportunities as to how the area around Colbert can be activated

(interim/meanwhile uses) while development is being readied.

The Members thanked the officials from the Land Development Agency for their

presentation but expressed disappointment in the timelines outlined for the actual delivery

of housing units at this location, having regard to the current housing crisis. They also noted

that all developments were dependent on planning and other approvals and any delays in

these processes would further push out actual delivery of housing. Members also agreed

that issues and delays with Bord Pleanála would also affect development. They also referred

to the delays in transferring land at the former CIE Social Club on Carey’s Road. Members

queried whether smaller scale developments across a number of locations could be

designed and delivered faster, rather than one very large complex project.

The A/Director, Economic Development and Enterprise noted the issues and concerns raised

by Members. He referred to the Memorandum of Understanding signed by LDA and LCCC

September 2022 agreeing to work together to secure the development of the Guinness site

as envisioned in the CQSF agreement. He also welcomed the fact that the LDA were opening

an office in Limerick. He did note however that all proposed developments were subject to

the planning and other processes and this would have to be dealt with as developments

were being proposed.

Circulated, (a) report of the Director, Housing, dated 21st September, 2022, seeking

the approval of the Council to the repurposing of the Troy Studios loan repaid by Limerick

Twenty Thirty in the amount of €6,484,017.63 for housing capital purposes; and (b) Note on

Troy Studios dated 21st September, 2022, from the A/Director, Economic Development and

Enterprise, outlining the background.

The A/Director, Economic Development and Enterprise, outlined the background to Members

when in 2015 that Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC (then LCO Enterprise Development Company

Limited) purchased the former Dell Factory in Castletroy with a loan from Limerick City &

County Council. The loan was for the purchase of the site and renovation works to make the

former factory into a usable space for a film studio. The loan was for €6.617m over a 20-year

period with interest.

In November 2015, Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC signed a 20-year lease with Troy Studios. The

objective of this venture was to ensure year-round film production at Troy Studios and work

commenced on constructing a new sound stage and other supporting infrastructure. The 20-

year lease gave Troy an option to purchase the property for a price that would cover the

purchase and infrastructural support costs. The former Factory has an overall footprint of
---
14

350,000 sq. ft. under one roof, has 4 sound stages totalling 100,000 sq. ft. & with a 5-acre

backlot.

He confirmed that it has been reported that the first production at Troy Studios, Night flyers,

provided the following economic impact to the region:



€53 m spent over 9 months;



320 people directly employed;



91% Irish crew;



91 production trainees;



€4.5 m spent on Limerick accommodation/living;



€104 k average annualized salary.

In August 2021 Troy Studios, along with its sister operation in Ireland, Ardmore Studios

announced there acquisition by a joint venture of Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile

Capital Management. This partnership owns the world’s largest independent studio and

media portfolio entailing €3.6 Billion in media real estate assets and exclusively services over

360 sound stages within its MBS Group network in 65+ locations across 46 cities and 4

countries.

He confirmed that Troy Studio exercised their option to purchase out the lease and property

assets and Troy completed the purchase from the Council in July 2022. Limerick Twenty Thirty

was then able to pay back Limerick City and County Council the loan of €6.617m, (Total

amount repaid €8.595m (€7.761m Principal+ €0.834m Interest). This was also in tandem with

generating an estimated economic impact to the region of over 7 years well in excess of

€122m.

The Director, Housing then outlined the position with regard to demands on internal

resources on voids, vacancies and Energy Efficiency Retrofit Scheme 2022. She explained

that the estimated cost of the schemes for 2022 is €21,898,289. Current revenue provision

is €792,744 and that funding from the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Heritage (DHLGH) of €5,831,599 had already been secured.

She confirmed that additional funding applications in the amount of €7,563,289 had already

been made or will be made. However, even if this additional funding is granted there will be

a deficit of €7,710,657 and if no additional funds are made available by DHLGH, the deficit

will be €15,273,946.

There is an ongoing requirement for funding for voids/vacants due to turnover in tenants on

an annual basis and she recommended that a sinking fund be established to make provision

for future requirements in this area.

She requested approval for the repurposing of the Troy Studios Loan in the amount of

€6,484,017.63 for housing capital purposes in accordance with Section 106 of the Local

Government Act, 2001, as amended. This loan was taken out with preferential interest

rates and in the current climate, this would guarantee the best rate in lieu of going to the

market place for a new loan. The balance of the funding for the above schemes for 2022

would come from capital transfer from the Revenue Account previously approved by

Council under Section 104 of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended.

The Members welcomed this proposal and for the creative thinking involved to secure this.

They stressed the importance of getting council properties refurbished and repaired so as to

return them quickly for re-allocation so as to address the ongoing housing pressures

experienced by people across both the City and County.

Proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon;

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J);

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the repurposing of the

Troy Studios loan repaid by Limerick Twenty Thirty in the amount of €6,484,017.63 for

housing capital purposes, in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act, 2001,

as amended.”

Transportation and Mobility

**(a)**

Part 8 Planning – Proposed N21 Coolanoran Traffic Calming Scheme

Circulated, report from the Mid West National Road Design Office dated 17th August,

2022, and enclosed Chief Executive’s Report dated 18th August, 2022, setting out details in

relation to proposed N21 Coolanoran Traffic Calming Scheme.  The report had been prepared

in accordance with Section 179 3(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended)

and Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 (as amended).

Some Members referred to the fact that a speed limit of 100km per hour was being

retained at the location of the traffic-calming scheme, and suggested that the speed should

be reduced to 60km per hour as part of the development. The Director, Transportation and

Mobility, confirmed that the issue of the applicable speed limit for this traffic-calming scheme

had been considered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) as part of a Speed Limit Appeal

submitted earlier this year, and that they had indicated that the rate of 100km per hour was

deemed appropriate in line with the guidelines. He indicated that the previous speed limit

review was carried out in 2017 and that the next review will take place within four years.

The Director also flagged that the Traffic Calming Scheme may not proceed if the speed limit

was amended, and that the speed limit could be looked at in the future as part of the next

general speed limit review process that would take place across the local authority area. Some

Members stated that they did not agree with this decision by the TII and that the Part 8 should

be amended to include a requirement to reduce the speed limit to 60km per hour, whilst

other Members believed that the scheme should be passed without the amendment, so as to

ensure that the scheme did go ahead and the speed limit could then be looked at as part of

the next speed limit review process.

The following variation to the proposed Part 8 was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J),

seconded by Councillor Teskey:
---
16

“That the proposed development be carried out as recommended in the CE Report dated 18th

August 2022, but subject to the variation that a speed limit of 60km per hour be put in place

as part of the Traffic Calming Scheme.”

Following further discussion, the Mayor directed that a vote be taken on the proposal, and

the result of the voting was as follows:

**REPLY:**

The Local Improvement Scheme 2022 Scheme Outline defines a Landowner as

“the owner of a farm holding actively engaged in agricultural activities,” as

opposed to a Householder which is defined as**“**the owner or occupier of a

property.”

The definition of eligible road projects with respect to a Local Improvement

Scheme are those that involve the construction or improvement of non-public

roads, subject to the following criteria being met:

 Road projects which provide access to parcels of land of which two or more

are owned or occupied by different persons engaged in separate

agricultural activities; or

 Road projects which provide access for harvesting purposes (including turf

or seaweed) for two or more persons; or

 Road projects which provide access to at least one parcel of land owned or

occupied by a person engaged in agricultural activities AND which

separately provides access for harvesting purposes (including turf or

seaweed) for at least one other person.

Applicants should provide documentation to verify that they are engaged

in agricultural activities on the parcel of land accessed by the road project

e.g. a herd/flock number and a copy of the maps associated with their Basic

Payment Scheme application provided by the Department of Agriculture,

Food and the Marine, or equivalent documentation. The onus shall be on

individual applicants to submit the required documentation in support of

their eligibility*. The local authority should demonstrate a degree of*

*flexibility in relation to this requirement if alternative documentary*

*evidence can be provided.*

Where the occupier of the land is not the registered owner, the occupier

should provide a copy of the lease agreement in place for the land in

question, together with confirmation of the consent of the registered

owner (or beneficial owner in the event that the registered owner is

deceased).

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council adopt a more**

**considered and unconstrained interpretation of the Guidelines to qualify for a Local**

**Improvement Scheme as set out in the February/April 2020 Memorandum and Scheme**

**Outline issued by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs.**

**REPLY:**

The Local Improvement Scheme 2022 Scheme Outline provides clarification on

eligible and non-eligible Local Improvement Schemes. The Scheme Outline

defines these projects as follows:

**Eligible road projects** are those that involve the construction or improvement

of non- public roads as follows:

 Road projects which provide access to parcels of land of which two or more

are owned or occupied by different persons engaged in separate

agricultural activities; or

 Road projects which provide access for harvesting purposes (including turf

or seaweed) for two or more persons; or

 Road projects which provide access to at least one parcel of land owned or

occupied by a person engaged in agricultural activities AND which

separately provides access for harvesting purposes (including turf or

seaweed) for at least one other person.

In addition, works can also be carried out on Amenity Roads. Amenity Roads

are non-public roads leading to important community amenities such as

graveyards, beaches, piers, mountain access points or other tourist/heritage

sites. Such roads may not account for more than 25% of the allocation

provided to each Local Authority.

Applicants should provide documentation (**NOTE 1**) to verify that they are

engaged in agricultural activities on the parcel of land accessed by the road

project e.g. a herd/flock number and a copy of the maps associated with their

Basic Payment Scheme application provided by the Department of Agriculture,
---
22

Food and the Marine, or equivalent documentation. The onus shall be on

individual applicants to submit the required documentation in support of their

eligibility*. The local authority should demonstrate a degree of flexibility in*

*relation to this requirement if alternative documentary evidence can be*

*provided.*

**Non-eligible road projects**

The following road projects are not eligible for funding under the Scheme:

 A road serving only houses or buildings occupied or used by persons not

engaged in agriculture.

 A road serving only Local Authority properties.

 A road leading to bogs developed commercially for large-scale turf

production.

 Projects involving drainage works only.

 A road leading to commercial enterprises.

 A road involving minor works which is within the competence of the

applicants to do themselves.

 A road which, because of its small size, would involve work which the local

authority would consider as being uneconomic to carry out.

**NOTE 1 -** where the documentation to be provided is assessed by Limerick City

and County Council as being insufficient to meet the Department of Rural and

Community Development’s scheme guidelines, the Council is happy to seek

clarification from the Department if an applicant is not satisfied with such an

assessment.

Thomondgate.

A consortium consisting of Whitebox Ltd. and Clúid Housing (an Approved Housing Body)

were selected as joint partners for the development of a residentially zoned site at New

Road, Thomondgate. This project will not just deliver much-needed mixed-tenure

(affordable cost-rental and rightsizing homes), but also a public riverside amenity park for

the benefit of the City. A planning application is currently being finalised with an expected

lodgement date before the year-end.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***commence on the People's Park playground.***

**REPLY**: It is expected that a contractor will be appointed by the middle of November with works

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick Council will***

***place yellow lines and parking restrictions sign in Avonmore Road and Dromore Rise, similar to***

***the signage installed in Meadowvale, due to the continuing dangerous parking on footpaths and***

***on bends in these estates in Raheen.***

**REPLY**: Double yellow lines have already been provided at junctions and bends on Avonmore Road

and Dromore Rise. Free roadside parking is permitted at other locations in these estates.

There is no regulatory sign to inform motorists where they cannot park on public footpaths,

as it is illegal to park on any public footpaths. The cost of a fixed penalty for parking on a
---
8

footpath was increased from €40 to €80 in February 2022. Such penalties for parking on a

footpath or on a double yellow line can be issued by Limerick City & County Council Traffic

Wardens and An Garda Síochána.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick; only 31 people have been***

***identified as potential housing first candidates in the Limerick area, under the Housing for All***

***Plan. This sets the target number of housing first tenancies, over the next 4 years, at 31. What***

***are the criteria for identifying housing first candidates and where did the figure of 31 come from.***

**REPLY**: Under the Housing for All Plan 2022-2026, each Local Authority was allocated a Housing

First target. Following a review of future requirements by The Housing Agency, Limerick City

and County Councils target of 31 was directed by the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage. Clients are assessed by the Homeless Action Team, comprising

of Local Authority and HSE staff to determine a person’s suitability to the project.

Housing First provides an effective solution for individuals who have repeatedly tried and

failed to exit homelessness, who have given up on the treatment-then- housing ‘staircase’

approach, or who have been given up on by systems that regard them as ‘treatment

resistant’, ‘hard to reach’, ‘not housing ready’, or ‘homeless / rough sleeping by choice’.

Housing First successfully engages these individuals by offering and providing access to an

apartment of their own, as well as access to person-centred, community-based, recovery-

oriented visiting supports.

Limerick City and County Council, during the pilot phase 2019-2021, exceeded its original

target of 30 tenancies resulting in 37 tenancies being set-up, with Focus Ireland as the

service provider managing the tenancies.

For the 2022-2026 Housing for All Plan, the target of 31 is the minimum amount of units to

be delivered, local authorities can exceed this target as the Minister for Housing has

previously outlined. Limerick City and County Council have achieved the 2022 target as set

out in the plan.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what plans have been made***

***to ensure Council tenants whose houses fall below standard are made a priority for window***

***upgrade.***

**REPLY**: All requests for housing related maintenance calls are logged on Sugar/CRM and are then

assigned to the relevant team for assessment and action. In terms of a request for repair or

replacement of any windows and doors, each request is investigated and if a repair or

servicing is required then it is completed using the nominated contractor. In the case of

replacement requests, these are assessed and if urgent replacement is required then it is

done in sequence and immediate repairs may be completed depending upon the

circumstances. Not all requests result in the need for immediate replacement at that point

in time and the request is noted in the area.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many Council houses***

***in the Metropolitan District do not have a central heating system and what plans will now be put***

***in place to rectify this**situation.***

**REPLY**: All dwellings within the housing stock have a heating source consistent with Rental

Standards. The specifics of the heating systems vary given the number of dwellings within

the stock (currently 3,790 in the Metro area) and its age profile. There is no detailed data

available with regard to the numbers of each specific type of heating system such as open

fire, oil or gas fired boilers, back boilers, heat pumps etc. As part of pre-lets/voids where

vacant dwellings are renovated prior to re-tenanting the opportunity is taken to upgrade

the dwellings including heating systems depending upon the circumstances of the individual

dwelling. This is augmented by the works undertaken under the Energy Efficiency Upgrade

programme.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**20.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan (referred from the September Meeting**

**of Limerick City and County Council)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council positively engage with***

***residents to help resolve a significant and dangerous parking issue, which is causing serious***

***problems for residents of estates surrounding the University of Limerick with potential to result***

***in loss of life, should emergency vehicles not be able to gain access.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Secas and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan highlighted the difficulties caused by illegal parking

in estates surrounding University of Limerick. He stated that additional active travel measures

should be considered. Members supported the Motion and agreed that the University had an

important role to play in providing additional student accommodation, along with parking for

students, using some of its land to resolve the issue.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council recognises that there are have been incidents of careless

and illegal parking in residential areas adjacent to facilities such as University of Limerick

where parking impedes pedestrian access and damages the footpaths. The Council will

liaise with the University of Limerick’s Student Community Engagement Officer, who

engages with students and residents regarding parking, with a view to increasing awareness

of safety concerns and the importance of maintaining access to dwellings for emergency

services.

In recent weeks, penalties have been issued where vehicles were illegally parked. Such

penalties can be issued by Limerick City & County Council Traffic wardens as well as An

Garda Síochána. Other measures to increase general awareness will also be considered.

21. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**
---
10

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council close vehicle access to Little***

***William Street except for weekday deliveries to ensure the safety**of pedestrians and enhance city***

***experience on Thomas Street.***

In the absence of Councillor Leddin and with his permission, the Notice of Motion was proposed

by Councillor Secas. The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Donovan.

Members stated that there were a number of private properties on Little William Street and

consultation would also be required with their owners in relation to the proposal.

**REPLY**: The Council has previously committed to examining the feasibility of closing Little William

Street to through traffic, while also allowing controlled deliveries and emergency access.

However, it is important that this assessment reflects the true desire line for both active

and vehicular journeys. Significant roadworks on both O'Connell St and, to a lesser extent,

Lower Thomas Street, have been ongoing throughout this year and significantly influenced

travel decisions in the immediate area. The Council also needed to await the further

development of the Laneways Strategy to ensure consistency of approach in this area.

Following the completion of the aforementioned O’Connell Street roadworks early in the

New Year, a study of pedestrian, cycle and vehicular movements will be undertaken in

vicinity of Little William Street. If this assessment indicates a significant desire to introduce

pedestrianisation on the street, a formal consultation process with affected

parties/stakeholders will be undertaken to reach final decision on the issue.

22. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council purchase the former***

***Debenhams Store using one of our existing DAC companies and redesign for residential use.***

In the absence of Councillor Leddin and with his permission, the Notice of Motion was proposed

by Councillor Secas. The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Donovan.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council, Place-Making and Public Realm Department are engaging

with landowners and stakeholders in the Arthurs Quay Area to advance the World Class

Waterfront Urban Regeneration Development Fund Programme and deliver a

comprehensive framework for this part of the city.  The current site is in the ownership of a

third party who is actively engaging with the Council and the framework to progress

development.

23. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Active Travel***

***Team examine and access the entrance to Woodlawn Park, to address the issue of safety and I***

***would also ask that the existing pedestrian crossing located to the left of the Woodlawn Park***

***entrance be replaced with traffic lights.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Pond and

agreed.
---
11

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted the difficulties for residents exiting the

estate onto Ballysimon Road, which was an extremely busy road and the need for traffic calming

measures to be put in place. She stated there were proposals for an apartment development,

which would further increase traffic in the area.

**REPLY**: The Active Travel Team will engage a consultant to undertake an independent road safety

audit of the Woodlawn Park entrance and of the existing zebra crossing to the city side of

the entrance.

24. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council become leaders in energy conservation and generation, by retrofitting all their***

***buildings to the highest standards and installing rooftop solar panels.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Benson and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan stated that the Local Authority’s buildings, such as

City and County Hall, should be as energy efficient as possible. He queried if funding could be

accessed from the European Investment Fund.

**REPLY**: LCCC consistently aim to be leaders in energy conservation and generation and attained ISO

50001 Energy Management System Certification in 2018. LCCC also exceeded the 33%

Public Sector target relating to energy efficiency measures in 2020 having achieved 44%.

We are currently looking for suitable locations at our buildings for the installation of PV

Panels and once identified will engage technically competent companies to design the

systems with a view to maximising output.

In September, the Cabinet approved a suite of energy efficient measures across the public

sector. As a public body, LCCC recently implemented the proposals from the “Reduce Your

Use” efficiency campaign. These measures will result in reduced heating plant run times

and temperatures in Council buildings over the coming months. Over the coming weeks,

LCCC will install thermal jackets on exposed pipework in plant rooms and this will further

improve energy efficiency at selected locations going forward.

25. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council look at***

***providing additional safety measures for Caherdavin Boys School and Caherdavin Girls School, as***

***part of the safe routes to school programme.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Benson stated that consideration should be given to additional

safety measures near the Schools in Caherdavin and that Sheelin Drive and Alderwood Avenue

should be looked at.
---
12

**REPLY**: The Safe Routes to School Programme was launched in March 2021 and every school in

Ireland was invited to submit an expression of interest to participate in the initiative.

Caherdavin Boys School and Caherdavin Girls School did not make an application to be part

of the programme.

29 schools in Limerick applied to be part of the Safe Routes to School programme. We are

currently working with eight schools in Limerick who are on Round 1 of the programme.

Once these schools have been supported, then subsequent schools will be brought onto

the programme from the existing waitlist.

The programme is funded by the Department of Transport through the National Transport

Authority (NTA) and is supported by the Department of Education. An Taisce’s Green-

Schools is coordinating the programme. Limerick City and County Council assists on the

delivery of this programme through design and delivery of the infrastructure.

If the programme reopens for new applications in the future, both of the schools would be

eligible to apply. In the short term, we will make contact with both schools to establish the

particular safety concerns and determine whether the concerns can be addressed at local

level outside the formal Safe Routes to School programme.

26. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson (to be referred to the Community, Leisure**

**and Culture Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council***

***undertake a feasibility study for a permanent ice rink in Limerick and to engage with the Olympic***

***Federation of Ireland and other relevant bodies in relation to this matter, including the Minister***

***for Sport.***

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the Notice of Motion was taken at the Meeting.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Benson stated that the development of a permanent ice rink

would have enormous social and economic benefits for the region. She said it would be an

attraction for all ages and be a unique tourist attraction for the city. The Members supported the

Motion, particularly given as Limerick reputation as a sporting city and they agreed that it would

also be an opportunity for Third Level Institutes to expand their sporting programmes.

27. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the**Council notes***

***that:***

***Pavement parking can pose a hazard to pedestrians, especially people with sight loss, pushchairs,***

***wheelchair users and other disabled people.***

***Pavements are not designed to take the weight of vehicles and so surfaces become damaged or***

***subside, presenting a further hazard to pedestrians, particularly those with disabilities.***

***That the Council will conduct a public awareness campaign about the dangers of pavement***
---
13

***parking, that Council will adopt a zero-tolerance approach when a car completely blocks a***

***footpath and that the Council will conduct a pilot programme of zero tolerance and targeted***

***enforcement on Wickham Street/Parnell Street and O'Connell Street for a defined period.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor Secas and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) highlighted the difficulties caused by pavement

parking, in particular for wheelchair users and people with disabilities. Members agreed that this

was unacceptable behaviour by some motorists and that greater enforcement measures were

required with zero tolerance for this type of behaviour. They also agreed that a public awareness

campaign was needed to educate people about proper driver behaviour. Parking in cycle lanes was

also an issue and Members agreed that this was also totally unacceptable and that enforcement

action should take place to deal with any misdemeanours.

**REPLY**: The cost of a fixed charge penalty for anyone who parks on a footpath was increased from

€40 to €80 in February 2022 as a measure to promote Active Travel and encourage more

considerable use of road space. While a nationwide public awareness campaign

accompanied this change, there is merit in promoting further awareness at a local level in

addition to enforcement where road users are continuing to park on footpaths.

When necessary, we will take action and issue penalties in respect of such illegal parking.

Such penalties can be issued by Limerick City & County Council Traffic wardens as well as

An Garda Síochána. Other measures to increase general awareness will also be considered.

It was agreed that Items 28 and 31 would be taken together.

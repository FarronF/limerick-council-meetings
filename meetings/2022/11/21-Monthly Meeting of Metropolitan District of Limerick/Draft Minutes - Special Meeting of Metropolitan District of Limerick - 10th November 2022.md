**King’s Island Walled Town – Nicholas Street Rejuvenation Works**

The A/Senior Architect, Place-Making and Public Realm gave a PowerPoint Presentation on the

King’s Island Walled Town – Nicholas Street Rejuvenation Works which covered the following:

 Previous Dereliction

 Status of King John’s Castle

 Recently Completed Projects

 Short Term Projects

 Medium Term Projects

 Long Term Projects.

He stated that Nicholas Street was anchored between St Mary’s Cathedral and King Johns Castle, a

very important historical area of Limerick. He noted that in 2012 that Nicholas Street had a lot of

dereliction, and was deteriorating quickly. The Local Authority, through Regeneration Projects, had

intervened and acquired a number of buildings in the area, which were refurbished successfully.

He referred to King John’s Castle, now under the ownership of Limerick City and County Council, as

key to the Street and was now one of the top visitor attractions in Ireland. He stated that a budget

was available for small interventions, a number of which were completed, including the site

clearance to the Fireplace Site. He outlined details of medium and long-term projects for the area,

and noted the positive effect of the Meanwhile Use of sites around Nicholas Street.

Members thanked the A/Senior Architect for the Presentation and highlighted the historical

importance of Nicholas Street to the city and the need to develop it.

Members referred to the poor surface of the road on Nicholas Street. Members also referred to

the cost of road closures for businesses and requested that consideration is given to reducing these

costs in order to support businesses trying to improve the footfall in this area. They stated that

improvements to lighting on the street should also be considered to attract more people to the

Street.

Members referred to the visitor numbers at King John’s Castle and suggested that it could also be

used for other events, such as civic receptions and Council meetings, now that it is under the

ownership of the Council. Members welcomed the improvements to the Bridge Street Infill Site

and noted its potential as a green site.

The Director, Planning, Environment and Place-Making confirmed that work has been undertaken,

in conjunction with other directorates, to support businesses in Nicholas Street, and welcomed the

comments and suggestions made by Councillors in relation to increasing visitors to the area. She

noted the need for supporting new businesses to the area. The A/Senior Architect, Place-Making

and Public Realm, thanked the Members for their input and noted their comments. He pointed out

that funding was there for small to medium projects to improve the area and agreed to work in

together with Members and other Departments to achieve this.

from the URDF, and pointed out work that had been carried out to date, including engagement with

the Milk Market and High Street Traders Group, traffic counts and the setting up of a Working

Group. She stated a further update would be provided to Members in early 2023.

Members highlighted the success of the Milk Market and in particular for tourism in the city. They

pointed out that the Market is the next biggest tourism attraction in Limerick, after King Johns

Castle, and noted the need to use the Market more. Members referred to a number of issues that

needed to be addressed such as cleaning in the area, lighting, road surfaces and the provision of

planters.

The Director, Planning, Environment and Place-Making, welcomed the comments made by

Members and agreed to hold workshops with Members to work together on the High Street and

Milk Market area. She confirmed the operational issues discussed would be relayed back to

relevant directorates and the group setup to work jointly on improving the Market area.

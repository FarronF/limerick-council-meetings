3.

Planning, Environment and Place-Making Directorate

To receive Update on the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Senior Engineer, Travel and Transport Strategy, to the

Meeting.

The Senior Engineer gave an update to the Members on the progress to date with regard to

the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan and wished to thank the Senior Executive Engineer,

Place Making and Public Realm (Mr. Kieran O’Gorman) for his work to-date on the project.

The Senior Engineer stated that Part 8 Planning was approved for the scheme in May 2018

and costings had been prepared at that time. However changes have since been made and a

new up to date costing has been prepared. It is estimated that the scheme in its current form

will cost approximately €12m to complete.

He referred to discussions which have taken place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)

with regard to securing funding and stated that the TII have agreed in principle to part fund

the project. The Senior Engineer stated that discussions have also have taken place with the

National Transport Authority (NTA) with regard to obtaining funding for the project and it is

hoped that the NTA would enter into a co-funding arrangement with the Council subject to

certain measures being met. The Senior Engineer stated that in order to secure funding from

both Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority it is necessary that

the Council ensure that proper planning is in place, which would take into account the

additional works proposed. He also referred to the expression of interest by the National

Transport Authority in improving the link between the town centre in Abbeyfeale and the

Limerick Greenway.

The Senior Engineer also stated that it is proposed to put a short list of contractors in place

and to have contract documents prepared to deliver the scheme as soon as possible. It is

envisaged that the scheme would commence at the end of 2022 and it will take twelve to

fifteen months to complete.

The Members thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for the comprehensive presentation and

welcomed the proposed funding but expressed concern on the proposed increase in costs for

the project. A number of other matters were also raised by the Members including the

 the compliance report which is currently being prepared and which is to be submitted

to the Planning Department for consideration,

 connectivity between Abbeyfeale town and the Limerick Greenway,

 the appointment of contractors to carry out CCTV survey of all services within the

town,

 the timeframe for commencement of works,

 provision of a public toilet as part of the programme of works and

 the demolition of Jack Riordan’s pub.

The resurfacing of a section of the road at Mountmahon, Abbeyfeale was also raised and it

was noted that these works are being progressed by the Mid-West National Road Design

Office and will be completed in conjunction with the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer referred to the increase in the cost of materials and

that high quality materials have been chosen for the project. With regard to the link between

Abbeyfeale town and the Limerick Greenway, this would require a separate planning

application.

The Director referred to the timeframe involved in progressing the Abbeyfeale Traffic

Management Plan and stated that the length of time taken to commence the project is not

uncommon considering the scale of the project involved.

Following discussion on the above, the Members requested regular updates on the Scheme

and that this Item remain on the Agenda of the Monthly Meeting of the Newcastle West

Municipal District going forward.

4.

Transportation and Mobility Directorate

To receive Update on Distributor Roads for Newcastle West and

Abbeyfeale

The Senior Engineer outlined to the Members the current situation with regard to distributor

roads for Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale. He also referred to the Limerick Development

Plan 2022 – 2028, which will set out an overall strategy for proper planning in all towns in the

functional area of Limerick.

He stated that review of the Local Area Plans for Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale will take

place in the coming months and noted that the Distributor Roads for Newcastle West and

Abbeyfeale are in the existing plans. The Senior Engineer stated that the primary function of

the distributor roads for Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale is to aid and help development in

both towns. He also stated that it is unlikely that external funding will be available for these

projects given the current economic situation.

He also noted the proposed By passes of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale which are currently

being progressed by the National Mid West Road Design Office and these once built should

reduce traffic going through both towns by 50% - 55% approximately.

Following discussion, the Members referred to a number of matters including the urgency

and necessity of having a distributor road for Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale to enable the

efficient flow of traffic through the towns, to relieve traffic congestion and to improve growth

and economic development opportunities in the towns. The funding costs to date for this

project and the money allocated in identifying the docking points of the Distributor Roads

was raised.
---

It was proposed by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Scanlan and agreed by all, that

the provision of a distributor roads for Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale should be a Council

led project rather than a Developer led project. The Members also requested that a report

on the costs and works to date on both roads and that this be provided for the March Meeting.

The Director also agreed to arrange a Meeting with the Planning, Environment, Place-Making

and Transportation and Mobility Directorates with regard to how the routes will be finalised,

timeframe for same and funding options for the projects.

5.

On the proposal of Councillor Foley, seconded by Councillor Sheahan, it was agreed to allocate

€4,590 for fencing works at Belfry Heights, Abbeyfeale.

On the proposal of Councillor Scanlan, seconded by Councillor Galvin, it was agreed to allocate

€4,500 to Dromcollogher Town Park.

DEFERRED QUESTION

6.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting**when (a) the 2 Council owned properties at Coolaboy, The***

***Square, Dromcollogher will be cleaned up and (b) what plans are in place to have them***

***tenanted and in what timeframe.***

REPLY:

The two dwellings referred to in the query both have an address of North Road,

Dromcollogher (just off the square on the R522).

The dwellings are adjacent to each other on the North Road.

The first dwelling was acquired through the Buy and Renew scheme and is a 3 bedroomed

unit.

Arrangements are presently being made to have it scoped and investigated for required

works. This will be completed by the end of February. Once the scoping is complete, a

detailed list of the necessary work will be known and all specific constraints will have been

identified. An internal layout will then be designed taking account of the constraints.

Following the completion of the scoping and design then the tender competition to procure

a contractor will be undertaken. It is estimated that the work phase from the date of
---
5

appointment of a contractor to completion will take six months. It is not possible to give a

precise date at this time. However, subject to their being no delays it is targeted to have the

unit completed by the end of 2022.

The second dwelling is adjacent to the above and is in the process of a stock transfer to an

Approved Housing Body. This property will be brought to the March Municipal Meeting for

noting. The AHB will undertake the necessary works to the dwelling once the property is

approved for transfer at the March Full Council meeting.

The units are side by side and have specific constraints that makes their redevelopment more

complex than usual. The option of developing both units together was examined but was

discounted. There will be close co-operation between both the LCCC and AHB design team

to ensure that all works are carried out as efficiently as possible.

QUESTIONS

7.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting**that the stoned feature along the right hand side approach to***

REPLY:

The Western boundary wall of St. David’s Graveyard in Newcastle West up to

its rear entrance is visually structurally sound and currently requires no repair.

The external face of the boundary wall that abutting onto The Demesne Park,

there is evidence of both Tree and Vegetation growth extending over the wall

NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will move at the next Meeting that a wheelchair space/loading bay be installed outside***

***the NCBI shop across from Office 1 Stationary shop at the Square Newcastle West. Some***

***workers have sight issues and need to be dropped off for work.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle noted that he had discussed this matter with the

Senior Executive Engineer who confirmed that it was not feasible to carry out these works. It

was also noted that there is disability parking space outside the Bank of Ireland in Newcastle

West which is very close to the NCBI shop.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would install a***

***pedestrian crossing between The Square, Newcastle West and Bishop Street, Newcastle***

***West. This street is one of the busiest in the town having the post office and Supervalu in***

***close proximity and pedestrian safety is an issue at that location.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins requested that a pedestrian crossing be installed

from The Square to Bishop Street in Newcastle West in the interests of safety.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer agreed to prepare a design and costing for this

project.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that the loading bay and one parking space be removed in***

***front of the Old Carnegie Library, Bishop Street, Newcastle West as traffic parking here is***

***impeding traffic flow and causes vehicular traffic to back up in both directions.***
---
10

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins requested that the loading bay and parking space

in front of the Old Carnegie Library be removed or moved to another location on Bishop St.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer noted that natural traffic calming measures are in

place due to the current traffic layout in this area of town and if a pedestrian crossing is

installed further down Bishop Street, the current traffic layout would assist in slowing traffic

down.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that an audit be conducted to establish grave space***

***availability in each of the operating cemeteries within the Newcastle West Municipal***

***area.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

In 2019 Limerick City and County Council conducted an audit of burial grounds when

compiling the Burial Ground Strategy. Below are figures updated to latest available data for

Councillor Scanlan welcomed the response and also referred to the buying in advance of

burial ground spaces where ample grave spaces are available. This advance purchase of grave

spaces would also assist in providing additional funding for improvement works in the Council

burial grounds.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council will not raise the price of grave spaces for***

***this Council.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council’s income from the sale of grave spaces has reduced from

€652,645.69 in 2016 to €581,056.57 in 2021. In the same period, there has been increased

demand for maintenance works in cemeteries throughout the county, i.e. footpath repairs,

wall repairs, signage, drainage and tree surgery works. Also, construction costs have increased

significantly in this period and the number of contractors tendering for these works has

decreased, particularly since early 2021.

In addition, new burial grounds have to be developed in line with recommendations of the

Burial Ground Strategy adopted by the Council in May 2021.

Charges for Burial Grounds have not been reviewed for six years.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin noted the rise in prices for burial ground spaces

and a discussion followed on the high cost of burial ground spaces in comparison to the

charges in place in other Local Authorities. It was also noted grave spaces cost a lot less in

community cemeteries. The work of the voluntary groups in maintaining cemeteries was also

acknowledged.

In replying, the Director agreed to convey the sentiments expressed by the Members back to

the Chief Executive.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the green be removed in Collins Park, Abbeyfeale to aid***

***parking and skip waste removals (small section), this was raised previously.***
---
12

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that the Council remove a section of the

green area in Collins Park to cater for parking and refuse truck entering the estate.

In replying, the Executive Engineer agreed to arrange an onsite meeting with representatives

from the Estate Management and Planning Sections at this location.

The following item were also raised.

The proposal to cease the issuing of Permits for the burning of Agricultural Waste as notifed

to the Members by the Planning, Environment and Place-Making Director was raised.

The Members noted that this was a Green Party proposal and advised that the burning of

agricultural waste when required should still take place under controlled and permitted

circumstances, which is currently the case. The Members also stated that an alternative

solution should be provided on how to dispose of agricultural waste should this practice

cease.

It was agreed to hold the March Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 1st March, 2022, at

10.00 a.m., at Áras William Smith OBrien.

This concluded the Meeting.

Councillor K. Sheahan, An Cathaoirleach.

**MEMBERS PRESENT:**

Councillors Collins, Keary, O’Donoghue and Teskey.

**OFFICIALS IN ATTENDANCE:**

Senior Engineer, LA Housing Construction and Maintenance (Mr. C. Culloo), Meetings

O’Keeffe), Clerical Officer (Ms. L. Lenihan).

**APOLOGIES:**

Councillor O’Brien, Director, Housing (Ms. C. Curley).

At the outset of the Meeting Councillor Teskey expressed disappointment that his

Motion proposing Limerick City and County Council support the HSE in the current

pandemic situation, where there are delays for ambulances due to staffing shortages, by

allowing the Fire & Emergency Services be activated to emergency medical calls to

provide first responder assistance in life and death situations had not been included on

the Agenda of the January Full Council Meeting and requested his motion be forwarded

for inclusion on the Agenda of the March Meeting of Limerick City and County Council.

This was seconded by Councillor Keary and agreed. Councillor Keary also stated a new

policy should be drafted around this issue to establish if a services amalgamation is

possible which would achieve better effectiveness in the system. The Meetings

Administrator advised a reply had been received from the Director of Service, National &

Regional Shared Services Centre and proceeded to read the response into the record as

follows:

**Reply:**

Limerick City and County Council has been working very closely to support

the HSE since the start of the pandemic on a wide range of matters including

the release of staff to work for the HSE, facilitating pop-up test centres,

assisting with traffic management for the vaccination centres and planning

for a range of responses. Close collaboration between the agencies of the

state has been a key cornerstone as Ireland responded to the major and

unheralded challenges associated with the pandemic. It is important to note

that there has been an excellent working relationship between the principal

response agencies throughout the pandemic as part of the ‘whole of

government approach’ at the local and regional level.

The issue of ambulances is currently being discussed at national level

between the Health Service Executive and National Directorate for Fire and

Emergency Management under the aegis of the Department of Housing,

Local Government and Heritage. Pending progress at the national level, the

Limerick Fire and Emergency Service will have to await guidance from the

National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in terms of this

issue and cannot progress this matter until the national discussions have

concluded.

Councillor Keary requested an update in relation to the Council depot on the N69 at

Kilcornan as there is still a lot of anxiety in the local community relating to the use of this

depot. Councillor Teskey also requested the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District engage

on a formal basis with Shannon Properties with a view to acquiring lands to provide a

suitable depot for the area. The Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West

Division advised Members fencing and extensive landscaping will be carried out on the

Kilcornan depot shortly and he further advised that a business case regarding a

Permanent Depot has been forwarded to the relevant management team for

consideration and a response is awaited.

**QUESTIONS**

**4.**

**Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will ask at the next Meeting when was it agreed that we now** **charge €1,500 for a single**

**grave in all of our Burial Grounds.**

**Reply:**

Limerick City and County Council carried out a review of charges for burial

grounds in 2021. These charges had not been reviewed in the past six

years. As a result of the review through scales of charges in 2022, the

decision was made in December 2021 to increase to €1,500.

Revenue from the sale of graves is used to support the operation and

maintenance of the graveyard service.

Councillor Sheahan requested an explanation for the increased costs of grave spaces and

said he was totally opposed to the new charges. Councillor Teskey proposed a motion

be forwarded from the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District to Full Council calling for this

charge to be revoked. This was seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed.

Councillor Keary further proposed Limerick City and County Council erect a columbarium

wall in each burial ground and also requested the Local Cemetery Bye-Laws be amended

to ensure consistency in the height of headstones in burial grounds in the City and

County. This was seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed. The Senior Engineer, LA

Housing Construction and Maintenance advised a burial ground strategy is being

complied presently and he agreed to provide an update to Members when this strategy

is complete.

**Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for a progress report on the promised**

**developments/improvements at The Carnegie Library in Askeaton.**

**Reply:**

Following a competitive Tendering process for suitable qualified Architects,

Feeny McMahon Architects, Limerick were appointed in December 2021 to

prepare surveys, designs, permissions, statutory consents, relevant

certificates, and tender packages for the works.

In January 2022 the architect and a structural engineer carried out a site visit

to the Carnegie Library in Askeaton.

The architects are now currently completing a structural assessment of the

building and the necessary works required to modernise same. They have

also engaged a conservation architect as the building is a protected structure

and any proposed works will need to adhere to conservation standards.

When this necessary phase has been completed, they will then move to

design the internal spaces. At this stage, they will meet with key stakeholders

to discuss their proposals.

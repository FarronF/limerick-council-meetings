NOTICES OF MOTION

8.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

“l will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that either

unsafe stones be removed or the wall to be conserved and that the safety fencing be removed

at Ballynoe Castle in the old Bruree Cemetery ASAP, so firstly, people can visit the graves of

their loved ones and secondly, the headstones underneath the Castle will not get damaged..”

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

**Reply:**

An application is being submitted under the 2022 Community Monuments Funding Scheme

(Department of Housing, Local Government & Heritage) for funding to consolidate the

structure. The Castle at Ballynoe is protected under the National Monuments Act and is a

significant structure in Limerick’s heritage.
---
The closing date for applications is 1 March, 2022. If the application is successful the proposed

works should consolidate the building and allow for access to graves at the base of the

structure, and must be completed by the end of November, 2022.

9.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

“I will move at next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that a date for

a new Plebiscite in relation to Directly Elected Mayor be held to inform the people of

Limerick City and County with full detail and clarity the term and powers of the new role of

the elected Mayor. The public were not fully informed on previous plebiscite with scant

information. Otherwise postpone this indefinitely.”

**Proposed: Councillor Mitchell**

**Seconded: Councillor E Ryan**

**Supported by all Elected Members present**

It was proposed and agreed to amend the Notice of Motion to correspond with the

Department Planning and Local Government and call on Minister Burke regarding the

aforementioned Notice of Motion as follows:

“I will move at next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that Minister

Burke set a date for a new Plebiscite in relation to Directly Elected Mayor to inform the

people of Limerick City and County with full detail and clarity the term and powers of the

new role of the elected Mayor. The public were not fully informed on previous plebiscite

with scant information. Otherwise postpone this indefinitely.”

**Reply:**

“On 24 May 2019, a plebiscite was held to consider the Government’s proposal for a Mayor

with executive functions for Limerick City and County. The Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage is responsible for consulting members of the public and drafting

the legislation in response to the Plebiscite. The General Scheme of the Local

Government (Directly Elected Mayor with Executive Functions in Limerick City and County)

Bill 2021 was published in April 2021. The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government

and Heritage published The Report on Pre-Legislative Scrutiny of the General Scheme of the

Local Government (Directly Elected Mayor with Executive Functions in Limerick City and

County Council) Bill 2021 in November 2021. Minister Burke outlined that he will consider

how best to incorporate the recommendations of the Committee’s report into the General

Scheme and stated that it was his hope that many of the recommendations will be reflected

in the Bill before publication. **m**

The proposed motion, as drafted, to hold a Plebiscite in relation to the Directly Elected

Mayor, outlining full detail and clarity on the terms and powers of the new role of the

elected Mayor is a matter outside the remit of Limerick City and County Council. The

decision to postpone the implementation of the Directly Elected Mayor pending the
---
adoption of appropriate legislation is a matter more appropriately directed to the

Government.”

QUESTIONS

10.

Question submitted by Councillor Carey

l will ask at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock municipal district meeting that, if it is the policy

of the local authority to “not permit the sale of new burial plots in ancient cemeteries which

are on the record of monuments”, where is this policy documented and what is the process

to change it?

**Reply:**

The Limerick City and County Council Burial Ground Strategy, a copy of which can be found at

this link: https://www.limerick.ie/sites/default/files/media/documents/2021-05/05-f-ii-b-

draft-burial-ground-and-interment-strategy.pdf was adopted at the full Council Meeting of

May 2021.

The Burial Ground Strategy addresses the objectives of the current Development Plans and

the draft City and County Development Plan in relation to the preservation and protection of

Archaeological Heritage and Monuments: Objectives EH035 Preservation of the

Archaeological Heritage; Objective EH038 Protection of the Setting of Archaeological

Monuments in the draft City and County Development Plan.

The following extract from the Burial Ground Strategy outline the situation as it pertains to

Archaeological structures:

“*Many older burial grounds, which have little or no designated burial spaces available,*

*contain grassed areas that have no obvious indication of burial in the form of headstones or*

*markers. Most of these graveyards have been in use since at least the 13**th* *century (many are*

*much older) and it is likely that burials have taken place throughout the graveyard. These*

*graveyards are protected under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014 and are registered*

*as Recorded Monuments*. [Some are considered nationally important and since they are in

Local Authority ownership are therefore National Monuments.] *Re-using any of these areas*

*has the potential to damage archaeological material and to detract from the amenity as*

*modern memorials can be incongruous in an older setting.”*

It is important to note that none of the older graveyards have been subject to the rigorous

environmental testing that is now required to identify suitable areas for new burial grounds

in order to preserve water quality. It is likely that if they were many would fail, so it is

incumbent on the Council as the Sanitary Authority to protect ground water and to

discourage/prevent burial over and above existing family plots.

The policy is based on the principles of good heritage and environmental practice in burial

grounds.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor Carey

l will ask at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock municipal district meeting for an update on

when will the promised safety works on the Church at Kilfinane Cemetery be carried out?

These included, that a proper permanent support be erected, the West Wall propped up

and the remaining openings of the Church closed off.

**Reply:**

Temporary works were undertaken by Limerick City and County Council in 2021 to close off

the Church to public access.

An application is being submitted under the 2022 Community Monuments Funding Scheme

(Department of Housing, Local Government & Heritage) for funding to consolidate the

structure. The closing date for applications is 1 March, 2022. If the application is successful

the proposed works will consolidate the structure, allow unlimited access to the building and

create a heritage amenity within the graveyard, and must be completed by the end of

November, 2022.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor Egan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District what the cost

of purchasing a grave in the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District is.

**Reply:**

The cost of purchasing a grave in Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District is €1,500 per grave.

Limerick City and County Council carried out a review of the charges for burial grounds in

2021. These charges had not been reviewed in the past six years. As a result of the review

the decision was made as part of the Scale of Charges 2022 in December 2021, to increase

the charge to €1,500.

Revenue from the sale of graves is used to support the operation and maintenance of the

graveyard service.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

l will ask at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock municipal district meeting to have full

clarification in relation to derelict sites act, register, levy and modus operandi.

Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

l will ask at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock municipal district meeting for the appropriate

engineer to have a look and provide further proper safe parking to accommodate the

him shortly .”

**QUESTIONS**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a progress report on the***

***formulation of a Tree Strategy for Limerick City and County Council.***

**REPLY**: The Limerick Tree Strategy is at draft stage and is currently undergoing internal review. It is

anticipated that it should be finalised in Q2 2022.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a report on trees felled***

***by Limerick City and County Council during 2021 to include the number of trees felled, the number***

***of felling licenses applied for, the number of tree reports completed and the costs involved.***

**REPLY**:

The Council wishes to advise that the Forestry Act 2014 provides an exemption for tree felling

licenses in urban areas and also outlines distances from public roads where tree felling is exempted.

The Council ensures that tree felling is minimised and is only carried out in exceptional

circumstances, in particular where there is a safety concern.

In relation to tree reports, the Council seeks tree reports as and when required. In 2021, there were

no tree reports requested. The Council is embarking on a more proactive approach to tree

management and is considering a systematic approach to tree inspection, which will result in the

requirement for additional tree reports and general maintenance. This inspection and general

approach to tree management is included as part of the Tree Strategy which is currently under

preparation.

The Council has placed an increased focus on tree management and has dedicated a qualified

member of staff for all tree maintenance matters.

6.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to outline in tabular form,***

***notifications that Limerick City and County Council have made to the forestry service (as required***

***under the Forestry Act 2014) of their intention to fell trees they believed to be exempted from***

***the need to obtain a felling license, and the replies received from forest services.***

**REPLY**: The Council felled seventeen trees in 2021 for safety reasons, due to the danger posed by

the trees to members of the public as a result of disease and decay. The Council has the

appropriate powers to fell trees for road safety and safety in general under the Road Act

1994 and Forestry Act 2014.

The Council made no notifications to the Forestry Service in this regard. Going forward the

Council will notify the Forestry Service of its intention to fell trees where it is required.

7.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**---
5

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and County***

***Council list the structures and properties that they do not own but have entered into an***

***agreement with the owners to upkeep these*** ***structures and properties.***

**REPLY**: From a Roads perspective we have entered into a number of maintenance agreements with

Irish Rail in respect of 2 No. bridges in their ownership as well as a number of at-grade

barrier crossings (typically as a result of road improvement works).

The road structures owned by Irish Rail but requiring Council maintenance are

-

The overbridge rail crossings approaching the Kilmallock Roundabout over the

R509 Childers Road and R512 Kilmallock Road.

The Council have also an agreement in place to maintain a number of rail crossings and

associated barriers include at-grade crossings at

-

Lisnagry, Dock Road and Skehacreggaun.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and County***

***Council advise if there are any plans to connect the Old Ballysimon Road (V94AHR2) to the mains***

***as the resi**dents are still using septic tanks.***

**REPLY**: There is a mains sewer line at this location. It is open to property owners to submit a

connection application to Irish Water and this is a private individual issue.

9.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick why rent assessments are***

***taking so long to process. When a person updates their financial situation, documentation is sent***

***into the Rents Department to that affect and it can take up to two years for the tenants rent to***

***be updated resulting sometimes in arrears.***

**REPLY**: The Rents Unit manages a total of 5465 accounts, which generated an income of €17m for

the Council in 2021. In accordance with the terms the standard Letting Agreement, it is the

responsibility of tenants to immediately advise the Council of any changes within the

property, in terms of household composition or income, to enable the rent to be revised,

either upwards or downwards, depending on the circumstances. However, not all tenants

comply fully with this provision.

In 2017, the Rents Unit commenced a major exercise in trying to update household

composition and income details for all tenancies. All tenants were written to and this, of

course, generated a massive amount of correspondence. In the majority of cases, where all

necessary proofs etc. were submitted, a timely response was forthcoming in terms of any

changes accruing to amount of rent payable. However, in instances where necessary

supporting documentation was not submitted, it was often the case that the Rents Unit had

to pursue same through letters, phone calls etc. and, in some cases, this could be a lengthy

process.

One of the benefits from the aforementioned exercise is that the majority of tenants are

much more conscious of the need to advise the Rents Unit of household changes which may

impact on their rent and, as a result, there is a steady stream of rent assessment forms---
6

being submitted on a daily basis and every effort is made to process these as promptly as

possible.

It would be very unusual for any case to take up to two years to be finalised. If any member

wishes to raise any particular case, with the consent of the tenant, the individual

circumstances of the case can be reviewed.

10.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the Council to outline***

***what plans they have to restore O'Dwyer Bridge on Athlunkard Street given the deteriorating***

***condition of the paint on the bridge.***

**REPLY**: We are currently compiling a tendering framework for the cleaning and restoration of a

number of bridges in Limerick City including O’ Dwyer Bridge.

Pending funding availability and subject to suitable weather conditions we hope to

complete these works later in the year.

11.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on when the***

***upgrade works will commence at the People's Park playground, as they are long overdue.***

**REPLY**: In relation to the redevelopment of the People’s Park playground, the work to date has

comprised primarily of collating concepts for natural play and also ideas for accessible play

equipment for children in wheelchairs that could be considered for inclusion in People’s

Park playground. A number of playgrounds have also been visited that have incorporated

natural play and accessible play equipment. An example of the type of project that could be

considered for People’s Park is the Loughill playground.

The Council is developing a brief to that described above and will seek quotations from

Consultants to design and deliver the new playground for People’s Park. It is expected that

Consultants will be appointed by the end of March and the project delivered by the end of

this year.

12.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a bus shelter be***

***considered outside St. Nessan's School.***

**REPLY:** I wish to inform you that a permanent bus shelter will be incorporated into the detailed

design as part of the Quinn’s Cross to Raheen Roundabout Improvement Scheme. The bus

stop and bus shelter will be located across from Saint Nessan’s School (R510).

The Quinn’s Cross to Raheen Roundabout Improvement Scheme will be available for public

consultation as part of the Part 8 Planning process in the coming weeks.

13.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**---

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to request that railings on***

***footpaths surrounding properties on Lower Hartstonge Street and Parnell Street be removed as***

***they have been there for many months and are obstructing footpaths with no work progressing***

***on either property.***

**REPLY**: Owners of roadside buildings at both of these locations are the subject of legal notices

issues by Limerick City and County Council Dangerous Structures department.

Fencing was erected by the Roads Department to protect the public until the matters are

resolved.

We are advised that the issue is likely to be addressed in the coming months depending on

court dates available and\or action by property owners.

14.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council can expedite***

***the design completion for the location of the Columbarium Wall on the west side of the Kilmurray***

***cemetery to ensure the Columbarian Wall is built in this cemetery in a timely manner. Given the***

***continuing move towards the use of crematoriums, our communities are in real need of a suitable***

***and respectful place for relatives to store the ashes of departed loved ones.***

**REPLY**: The Council is finalising a design for the orientation and layout of a number of Columbarian

Walls for Kilmurray cemetery. It is intended to tender for the provision of one wall in the

near future, with a view to having the construction completed in Quarter Two 2022. The

Council will seek funding for additional walls subject to demand and will provide additional

Columbarian Walls subject to funding being secured.

15.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if a Contractor has been***

***appointed for the Regional Public Lighting Project and if a definitive programme for the entire***

***region involved in the Project has yet been finalised.***

**REPLY**: Cork County Council as the Lead Authority for the South West Regional Public Lighting

Energy Efficiency Project has recently signed a Contract with Le Cheile Consortium, a Design

Build Contractor for the project with a Contract Date of 28 January 2022. The Contractor

has submitted a 2.5 year programme, commencing in Cork in February 2022. Limerick is

currently programmed to commence in August 2023 and be completed by May 2024.

16.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Active Travel team***

***can include the five schools in the Roxboro Road / Sexton Street area in the Safe Route to School***

***initiative. There is a concentration of schools in the area and very few safety measures for the***

***provision of cyclists.***

**REPLY**: When the Safe Routes to School programme was first launched in March 2021, every school

in Ireland was invited to submit an expression of interest to participate in the initiative. Only

two of the five schools in the Roxboro Road / Sexton Street area applied to be part of the---
8

Safe Routes to School programme, Scoil Íosagáin CBS, Sexton Street and St. Michael's Infant

School, Sexton Street.

Both schools have been accepted onto the Safe Routes to School programme, but do not

form part of the initial Round 1 cohort for 2021 – 2022.

We are currently working with eight other schools in Limerick who are on Round 1 of the

programme. Once these schools have been supported then subsequent schools will be

brought onto the programme from the existing waitlist. There are currently 29 Limerick

schools on the waitlist.

At this time the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority do not

intend to add any more schools to the waitlist as there is considerable work to be done on

the ground with those that applied in 2021.

Independent of the Safe Routes to School programme, the Active Travel department are

currently preparing proposals for works along the Roxboro Road to help improve pedestrian

access in the area. These works will be of benefit to all of the schools in the Roxboro Road

/ Sexton Street area, as it will be safer for children to walk to and from school.

17.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if measures can be put in***

***place to address the safety issue at the intersection of Carey’s Road and Roxboro Road where***

***buses sometimes sweep onto the footpath,*** ***possibly endangering pedestrians.***

**REPLY**: Due to the adjacent topography at this junction, including the existing bridge and CIE

boundary wall a suitable remodelling of this junction would be difficult to achieve.

While we are not aware of any accident history indicating bus collisions with pedestrians

and have reviewed the RSA Collision Map at this junction we will review the junction to

ensure any improvements possible are undertaken if required.

We have also have raised awareness of this issue with CIE regarding how their drivers

approach this junction.

18.

**Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***proposed upgrades of the Playground in the People's Park.***

**REPLY:** In relation to the redevelopment of the People’s Park playground, the work to date has

comprised primarily of collating concepts for natural play and also ideas for accessible play

equipment for children in wheelchairs, that could be considered for inclusion in People’s

Park playground. A number of playgrounds have also been visited that have incorporated

natural play and accessible play equipment. An example of the type of project that could be

considered for People’s Park is the Loughill playground.

The Council is developing a brief to that described above and will seek quotations from

Consultants to design and deliver the new playground for People’s Park. It is expected that

Consultants will be appointed by the end of March and the project delivered by the end of---
9

this year.

**REPLY**: The draft Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) identifies a

Strategic Bus Corridor linking the general Castletroy/Ballysimon area with Limerick City via

Bloodmill Road and the recently constructed developer road through zoned lands in the

Ballysimon area. Immediately north of this developer road the existing condition of the

Bloodmill Road is very poor with a very restrictive culvert negatively impacting traffic

movement. The Council is currently in discussion with local stakeholders with regard to

realigning this section of Bloodmill Road to remove the restriction. Engineers will shortly

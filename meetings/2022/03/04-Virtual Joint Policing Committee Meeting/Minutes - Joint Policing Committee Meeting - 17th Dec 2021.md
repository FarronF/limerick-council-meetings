**1.MINUTES**

Circulated, copy of Minutes of Joint Policing Committee Meeting held on 3rd September, 2021 :

Proposed by Councillor S. Kiely

Seconded by Councillor J. Collins

**2.Update from Chief Superintendent**

The Chief Superintendent welcomed the reopening of businesses and said the Gardaí support the

businesses in line with Government guidelines. There are presently no Garda Covid checkpoints

taking place. Crime statistics is still artificial due to covid and there is reduced burglaries due to a lot

of people now working from home. He stated that there are numerous crime operations taking

place which have been very successful and has resulted in the imprisionment of a number of

criminals.

He stated that Limerick Courts are very busy with six courts running with the support of the Gardaí.

39,000 cases have been dealt with already and it is expected that up to 50,000 cases will be dealt

with in the courts by the end of the year which is double the number of cases in Cork. The amount of

work done in this area is incredible, however, due to the volume trial days become backed up.
---
The Chief Superintendent confirmed that a lot of work is being done in community policing. There

are a high number of drunk driving and drug driving offences and domestic abuse is still a major

concern nationally with an increase of 21%. This is reflective of covid. There is 80% call backs on

domestic abuse. €1m more worth of drugs seized this year compared to last year and which has

resulted in the imprisionment of a large number of individuals involved in the sale and distribution of

drugs. He pointed out that Gardaí alone cannot solve the drugs crisis and that society needed to

accept responsibility for fueling the drugs business and realise the dangers of drug using to

themselves and the wider public.

He stated that Limerick Garda division is, at times, fighting crime with significantly reduced resources

due to covid with 70 out of 400 frontline staff out sick last week. This puts added pressure on all of

the working units.

**3.Overview on Crime Statistics from Senior Crime and Policing Analyst**

Ms. L. Collins, Senior Crime and Policing Analyst gave a brief statistical overview of current crime

statistics.

Copy of Presentation would be circulated to all Members after the meeting.

**4.FILL VACANCY ON THE JOINT POLICING COMMITTEE CAUSED BY THE RESIGNATION OF**

**COUNCILLOR LIAM GALVIN**

The Chairman thanked Councillor Liam Galvin for his contribution to the Joint Policing Committee.

It was proposed by Councillor S. Kiely, seconded by Councillor S. Keary and unanimously agreed to

appoint Councillor J. Sheahan to the Joint Policing Committee.

**5.PRESENTATION BY SERGEANT MARTIN MCCARTHY, DIVISIONAL DRUGS UNIT**

Sergeant M. Dunne gave presentation on drugs as Sergeant McCarthy was unavailable to attend this

meeting.

He stated that in 2021 Gardaí from the Divisional Drugs Squad continued with investigations

targeting the proceeds of crime and in particular cash accumulated by persons involved in the

sale/supply of controlled drugs. In the year 2021, Gardaí seized €334,202 worth of drugs and €4,390

in cash. This cash has been seized as exhibits in relation to ongoing investigations.. There was 206

cases where persons were apprehended for offences of possession of drugs for the purpose of sale

and/or supply. It is widely accepted that the cultivation of cannabis is on the increase throughout

the country with a total of 11 cases in in Limerick in 2021. This is an area where Gardaí will focus

further attention in efforts to increase detections in 2022.

The Chief Superintendent stated that Operation COPOG has been working very well. There has been

extra community policing and the gardaí and the Regeneration Unit work closely together in

addressing drugs crime and anti social behaviour. He said this good work will be continued and

added that there are numerous cases before the courts. He pointed out that privately owned

houses are causing issues, however, every effort will be made to continue to address the problem of

sale and supply of drugs.
---
Deputy Quinlivan commended the Gardaí and all concerned in addressing this problem and

welcomed the increase in community policing in the city centre. He commended all involved in

Operation Copog, however, he voiced residents concerns regarding a property in the city that

operates a ‘24 hour drugs supermarket’ despite Gardaí raiding the property several times this year.

He said the front door of the house has been blocked off with cement with a small gap left to allow

for drugs transactions.

Councillor Keary said that drugs were also at epidemic levels in rural parts of the country. He

referred to individuals in his area with exceptionally high standards of living with very high powered

vehicles and no evidence of any form of employment other than social welfare.

Councillor Talukder referred to the targeting of the migrant community by criminals who felt safer in

their own country than Ireland and asked the Chief Sperintendent to help these people.

In reply, the Chief Superintendent stated he cannot comment on individual cases, however, he

assured Members that any house selling drugs would be targeted by Gardaí and people prosecuted

where necessary. He said that Gardaí and Limerick City and County Council are liaising to see if they

could take enforcement action in relation to this particular house as it is a privately owned house

and that causes more issues as regards what the Council can do. Assistance has been sought from

CAB and from the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. He pointed out that, under

Operation Copog, nine search operations were conducted under warrant in St. Mary’s Park since 3rd

September. He added that all burglary cases are followed up on and he assured Councillor Talukder

that the cases of migrant community are investigated the very same way as all other cases.

Councillor Kiely referred to businesses in the southside of the city who are being targeted by

underage and well known individuals who are terrorising and destroying property and was informed

by Superintendent O’Connor that he would take this on board and would monitor on an ongoing

bases. He would also assign community policing presence in the area.

**6.PRESENTATION BY INSPECTOR PADRAIG SUTTON ON ROAD SAFETY**

Inspector Sutton stated that on average every one in one hundred and thirty road side breath tests

returns positive for alcohol and every one in seven road side oral fluid swabs returns positive for

drugs. He added that drug driving offences are beginning to overtake drink driving offences. There

has been 4,721 breath tests so far this year with 36 drivers returning positive for alcohol and there

were 509 oral fluid drug tests with 78 drivers returning positive for drugs. He stated that there were

four fatal collisions in 2021. The Gardaí work with a lot of agencies in addressing road safety.

In reply to Members queries, Inspector Sutton stated that all Inspectors can sign off on alcohol and

drug testing at checkpoints. If someone fails either test they are arrested and then a further detailed

test is done. You are then taken to the Garda station where a doctor takes a blood sample. A car

can be stopped for a variety of reasons including showing signs of being incapable of driving a

vehicle adding that there are now reduced levels of alcohol before you fail a test. Prescription drugs

are also found when people are stopped and drug tested. However, the overall figures for drug and

alcohol testing is down on previous years due to covid.`

Superintendent Sugrue stated that there is an increase in anti social behaviour in the city centre and

because of this there is increased manpower for patrolling the city. He added that there is a new

operation in place since 1st December. Parking in taxi ranks and in disabled persons spaces is a

regular focus for Gardaí.
---
Councillor Costelloe expressed concern at the increase in domestic abuse adding that the services

available to domestic abuse victims is stretched and they need extra resources throughout the year.

He referred to the great work being done by these services and he referred specifically to the North

Star Project who do an excellent job in their community. He stated that all funds seized from the

sale / supply of drugs should stay in the area and used to fund these services.

The Chief Superintendent stated that he too was very concerned at the increase in domestic abuse,

however, said this is part of the national rise and a lot of it is due to covid restrictions. He added

that there are ongoing operations taking place to address this issue. He stated that the allocation of

cash ceased from the sale of drugs is a matter for the Oireachtas Members and not the Gardaí.

In reply to Councillor Keary, Inspector Sutton confirmed that Gardaí can test for both alcohol and

drugs at the side of the road. If there is a smell of cannabis in a car then that vehicle can be

examined. If somebody is tested for alcohol they are automatically tested for drugs, however, drug

testing takes longer than drink testing. If somebody is over the drinks limit they are deemed

intoxicated. People also need to read the boxes of prescribed medication. Some medications quite

clearly states not to drive while taking that medicine. He added that there is significant updating of

legislation taking place. A huge amount of resources is involved in this area and a lot of assets have

been seized. However, members of the public need to help Gardaí in this matter and need to realise

the harm drugs can have on people.

While every Garda District would welcome the allocation of additional resources, the Chief

Superintendent confirmed that substantial numbers of additional Gardai are provided to police

Castletroy area when student numbers surge, and during specific times throughout the year where

anti-social behaviour is anticipated. University of Limerick have supported An Garda Siochana to

provide additional Gardai to police the Castletroy area during these key times. Gardai continue to

work closely with the University of Limerick and residents groups in Castletroy.

The Chairman proposed that the Notice of Motion be amended as follows :

*“I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City* *and County Council call on the Chief*

*Superintendent to provide additional garda resources especially for the Castletroy area to tackle*

*ongoing anti social behaviour especially in the housing estates around University of Limerick”.*

This was seconded by Councillor Secas and unanimously agreed.

The Chief Superintendent stated that 800 Probationers will be trained in the Garda College and he

would welcome as many as possible of these in Limerick. A number of gardai in the Limerick division

are due to retire next year and it is a constant battle to keep the figures up. He said he would

welcome Members requests to Government for increased resources in Limerick.

**10.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sarah Kiely :**

*“I will move at the next Meeting of the* *Joint Policing Committee that An Garda Síochána provide*

*additional resources for foot and cycle patrols and that this be made a priority, as a matter of*

*urgency, for the city centre over the Christmas / New year period to tackle the increased criminal*

*acti**vity on streets which is having a detrimental impact on traders”.*

Councillor Kiely stated that traders feel that crime has escalated above any other year due to covid

pandemic. She stated that a lot of crime goes unreported because of no action by the Gardaí. There

is open drug dealing taking place in the city and anti social behaviour is witnessed on an ongoing

basis.

The Chief Superintendent stated that this reply will primarily address the Parnell Street and

surrounding city centre area which can at times be prone to anti-social behaviour and criminal

activity. Uniform and plain clothes resources from Roxboro Road Garda Station are being deployed

in the afore-mentioned area on a constant basis to perform proactive patrols. These arrangements

will continue throughout the Christmas and New Year period in order to ensure that a high visibility
---
policing presence is being maintained in this area daily. Additionally, dedicated Community Gardaí

at Roxboro Road will continue to liaise with businesses and residents in the Parnell Street area and

any policing issues reported will be dealt with appropriately. All proactive patrols will be recorded

on PULSE and the deployment of resources at this location will be the subject of daily monitoring

through the Garda District Performance and Accountability process.

Additional resources have already been allocated to police Limerick City Centre since the 1st

December 2021 with staff redeployed and supplemented by additional resources that are provided

on overtime. This operation will continue throughout December and will be reviewed in January.

This operation is targeting anti-social behaviour and drug related crimes and involves additional

Gardai on the beat and on mobile patrol in the City Centre during both day tours and night tours of

duty. There is an ongoing engagement with representatives of traders and vintners groups. The

priority will be on maximising Garda visibility so people see that Limerick City is a safe place to work

and to visit.

**11.Question submitted by Ms. Shirley Johnston, Limerick Suicide Watch :**

*“I will ask at the next meeting for An Garda Siochana to outline :*

*(a)*

*their current initiatives to combat bike theft in Limerick*

*(b)*

*their current success rate of bike recovery*

*Recent data gathered in the noteworthy.ie investigation identified Limerick as the area with the*

*second highest incidence of bike theft following Dublin. The fear of bike theft is a major*

*discouragement from everyday cycling and can have very traumatic effects on victims, especially on*

*younger cyclists. An Garda Siochana play an essential role in addressing theft that has occurred,*

*empowering theft prevention and supporting victims.*

*Can An Garda Siochana commit to :*

*(a)*

*developing a new strategy in consultation with stakeholders such as cycling advocacy groups*

*and the Council’s newly formed Active Travel Office to reduce the current rate of theft. This*

*strategy should develop clear KPI’s and annual reporting to stakeholders and the Joint*

*Policing Committee*

*(b)*

*a programme of supports to prevent theft (including identifying theft blackspots and risk*

*factors) that could be rolled out to schools and community groups through Community*

*Gardaí.*

*( c)*

*identifying where the lack of bike parking in visible, well lit areas is a contributory factor in*

*theft to enable the local authority to target specific areas for delivery of parking*

*improvements”.*

In reply, the Chief Superintendent stated that at present Gardai are conducting a number of ongoing

operations to target bike theft in the city centre and the University of Limerick and its

environs. While he could not go into specific details of these operations He stated that it involves

covert and overt operations involving members from Crime and Community Policing Units.

As a result of these ongoing operations in the past four weeks there had been a number of persons

arrested for offences relating to bike thefts and a number of prosecutions have commenced as well

as Juvenile Liaison referrals. Searches under warrant have also been conducted which resulted in

stolen bikes being recovered.

A significant crime prevention initiative was instigated in recent weeks with the University of

Limerick to promote bike safety and security and this will be ongoing throughout the academic year.
---
Community Policing Gardai supported by Limerick City and County Council also held a crime

prevention stand in the city centre aimed at providing information to members of the public in

relation to securing their bikes and preventing thefts. (September 2021)

Recently a number of Gardai and volunteers from Community associations have been trained on

property marking which was as a result of a collaboration with Limerick City and County Council and

Gardai where a property marking machine was purchased. In the new year Gardai will be setting up

“clinics” at third level colleges and other locations and inviting members of the public to attend to

get their bikes marked. This initiative would again be a further crime prevention tool in relation to

the theft of bikes.

The Garda Schools Programme, while hampered in the past 18 months due to Covid, will continue to

educate the youth with regard to crime prevention with an emphasis on bike safety.

In relation to victims of crime, all victims including those as a result of bike thefts will receive the full

support and services of the Garda Victim Service Office in Henry Street Garda Station.

In relation to Collaborations, the Gardai in Limerick have a very good working relationship with

Limerick City and County Council and have engaged in numerous initiatives in relation to safe cycling

and bike security over the past number of years and will continue to do so in the future. The Gardaí

are also very open to engaging with the Council and other stakeholders in relation to positive crime

prevention initiatives in the future.

**12.Question submitted by Mr. John Nugent, Garryowen Residents Association :**

*“I will ask at the next meeting to be briefed by the Chief Superintendent on the Garda Siochana Older*

*Persons Strategy with a special emphasis on any adaptions made or recommended due to Covid”.*

The Chief Superintendent stated that Covid-19 posed and still poses a great risk to the community,

particularly to vulnerable and older persons. It became apparent very early during the pandemic that

the advice of the Government, with respect to staying at home and reducing social contacts, would

have a detrimental effect on those individuals obtaining necessities in the course of their day. The

necessities identified were those who were unable to collect their pension in person and did not

have any other trusted persons to do so on their behalf. An Garda Síochána facilitated this aspect

whereby two (2) members were dispatched to discreetly collect monies, thus giving peace of mind

to the individuals. All guidelines with respect to Covid-19 were adhered to so that all parties involved

were safe.

Collecting groceries and prescriptions was also an aspect some individuals required assistance with;

this was facilitated whereby a list was obtained from the person, members of An Garda Síochána

attended to collect monies and were able to get the groceries and drop them, along with change,

back to the individual.

Members of An Garda Siochana Community Policing Units liaised with pharmacies in the city to

ensure they had contact details for the Community Policing Co-ordinator’s Office, so pertinent

deliveries could be undertaken by An Garda Síochána, where required. This was utilised a number of

times whereby pharmacies contacted the office and deliveries were co-ordinated.
---
The Limerick Covid-19 Community Response group was established to coordinate the volunteer

effort to support the elderly and those with underlying conditions. The Limerick initiative was led by

Limerick City and County Council in direct partnership with An Garda Síochána and the H.S.E. and

backed by Limerick G.A.A., Munster Rugby, I.R.F.U., F.A.I., Liveable Limerick, the Catholic Church and

Church of Ireland, Limerick Volunteer Centre and multiple sporting and volunteer groups. The

initiative was the first in the country to be established and received national exposure at the start of

the Covid-19 crisis. The centre was initially based at the Munster G.A.A. H.Q. – home also of Limerick

G.A.A. The initiative was unique in that it was the only centre in the country which maintained a full

time Garda presence of two Sergeants permanently attached to the centre. The presence of the

Garda Sergeants was paramount to ensuring that parties who contacted the Response Centre, were

given clear, accurate information, in line with relevant legislation as led by the Government. After

Limerick City and County Council assimilated the centre into the customer care line, An Garda

Síochána still maintained strong links and facilitated deliveries and welfare checks where requested.

Going forward the Community Gardai and Crime Prevention Officer will continue to engage pro-

actively with all associations and groups representing the elderly in both Limerick City and County.

Gardai will continue to offer support and assistance whenever needed to those most vulnerable in

society especially during the current pandemic.

It was suggested that formal recognition be given to all the various groups who helped the elderly

during Covid 19.

Mr. J. Nugent stated that he would like to see anti social behaviour and the effects of Covid included

in the Older Persons Strategy.

**13.Question submitted by Maurice Quinlivan, T.D. :**

*“I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the ongoing An Garda Síochána and Limerick City and*

*County Council’s operation ‘Operation Copóg’ in the St. Mary’s Park area and if there have been any*

*targeted raids in the period since the last meeting of the Joint Policing Committee”.*

The Chief Superintendent confirmed that Operation Copóg, which is essentially an increase in the

Community Policing staff that are dedicated to St Mary’s Park, is continuing.

There have been nine (9) search operations conducted under warrant in St Mary’s Park since the 3rd

of September 2021. One particular house has been searched on more than one occasion. Gardai will

continue to target drug dealing across Limerick, including St Mary’s Park.

The crack cocaine problem in Limerick City is continuing and spreading. International experience

suggests that searches and prosecutions will not fix this issue as the drug trade have a ready supply

of vulnerable people who are suffering from addiction.

The sale of crack cocaine from one particular house in St Mary’s Park is an ongoing problem, despite

frequent Garda searches and prosecutions. The house in question has been reinforced and some

structural changes have been made to make entry to the house more difficult. Gardai are engaging

with Limerick City & County Council to establish if they can take any enforcement action against the

individuals who are in control of this house.
---
The Chief Executive supported the Chief Superintendent in relation to St. Mary’s Park. The Council is

very committed to resolving the issue of drugs here and said he would ensure further action would

be taken in the New Year. Limerick City and County Council have a very strong partnership with An

Garda Síochána. He thanked the Chief Superintendent, Members of An Garda Síochána and Elected

Members for their help and support during Covid.

**14.Question submitted by Maurice Quinlivan, T.D. :**

*“I will ask at the next* *meeting for an update regarding the proposed pilot 24/7 Multi Agency mental*

*Health De-Escalation Team in Limerick, due to commence in 2022, outlining the proposed*

*commencement date and the number of Gardaí that are being trained to partake in the pilot”.*

The CAST project is still at the consultation phase with our partners the HSE. There is NO

The Chief Superintendent thanked the Members, Chief Executive and staff for their support during

the past year which was a very difficult year with many challenges. He stated that 2022 is the

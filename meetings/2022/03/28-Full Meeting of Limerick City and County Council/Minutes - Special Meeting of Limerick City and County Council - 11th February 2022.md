2.

Discussion on Development Plan process

The Mayor welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting and confirmed that he had agreed to

call a Special Meeting in order to clarify the situation regarding the making of the

Development Plan and the timelines involved, following receipt of correspondence from the

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage earlier in the week on the issue.

The A/Director, Economic Development and Enterprise proceeded with a presentation to the

Elected Members on the Development Plan process to date. He explained how the review of

the existing Development Plan had commenced in August 2020 and how extensive

consultation was undertaken throughout the summer of 2021 on the Draft Development Plan,

adapting practices to ensure that everyone had an opportunity to get involved in the process.

This included webinars, development of a virtual room, Online meetings held on Zoom, etc.
---
He confirmed that the next step in the process would be the Special Meeting scheduled for

Friday 18th February where the Members would consider the Draft Plan and the Chief

Executives Report to the elected Members, dated 26th November 2021, and accept or amend

the draft, under Section 12 (5) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

He then outlined how the two previous Development Plans for Limerick were adopted in 2010

for the City and County as separate local authority areas, and both were extended in duration

in 2014 to facilitate the merger of the two authorities to form Limerick City and County

Council. This led to the situation whereby the current Development Plans for Limerick City

and County have been in operation for almost 12 years to date. They are currently subject to

the review process now underway, which is due to conclude in 2022. This means that by the

time that the Plans are scheduled to be replaced, that they will have been operational for

twice as long as the normal 6-year review cycle.

He then advised that the Chief Planning Adviser in the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage had earlier in the week confirmed to Limerick City and County

Council that there is a potential option to add a period of time to Limerick City and County

Councils Development Plan review process. This was because in the course of preparing the

legislative proposals to extend the duration of plans in 2021, that legal advice was brought to

the attention of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the 9 day

‘Christmas pause’ which applies under s.251 of the Planning Act, may be applied to the full

statutory 6-year Development Plan review period set out in the Act.

The Department confirmed that this therefore allows for the addition of 54 days to the plan

review period (9 days x 6 years = 54 days). The Department also confirmed that, as the 12-

year period of duration of the Limerick plans is not set out in the Act, that the 6-year period

specified in the Act is the applicable period. The Department confirmed therefore that should

there be a need to extend the duration of the Limerick City and County Plan review process,

that the s.251 offers flexible provision for a short period of up to 54 days.

The Members thanked the A/Director, Economic Development and Enterprise for his

presentation and update in relation to the additional time allowed for the completion of the

Development Plan. They also noted the confirmation from the Chief Executive that this advice

had only been received earlier that week from the Department. The Members also noted the

extensive consultations, Meetings and Briefings that had already been provided in relation to

the Development Plan process.

There was a discussion amongst the Members as to how the additional 54 days would be

managed, in relation to the completion of the Development Plan, with some suggesting that

the deadline for completion of the Development Plan being extended from the 12th June 2022

by 54 days until the 5th August 2022. The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning

confirmed that it was also open to the Members to use the 54 days in segments, to give

flexibility to allow some additional time to the Members at the various remaining stages of

the process.

After further discussions and deliberations it was agreed not to formally extend the deadline

for completion to the 5th August 2022 and the Members agreed instead to continue with the
---
current process, with Members retaining the option to avail of the additional 54 days for

completion of the Development Plan process, as it went through the various other stages.

**Suspension of Standing Orders:** Some Members referred to additional proposed

Amendments that they had in relation to the Draft Development Plan. With the agreement

of the Mayor and on the proposal of Councillor Collins (M), seconded by Councillor Sheahan

(J), it was agreed to suspend Standing Orders to allow 4 days notice period for the

submission of amendments, instead of the 9 days notice period as stated in Standing

Orders.

The Meeting concluded with Mayor Butler thanking the Members, Forward Planning Staff

and the Executive for their input in relation to this issue and the decision made by the

Members.

He also extended his sympathies on behalf of the Members and Staff to the family and

friends of schoolboy Wiktor Chojecki from Newcastlewest, who had died tragically earlier

that morning in a car accident outside Adare. Members and officials observed a minutes

silence at the end of the Meeting as a mark of respect.

This legislation provides for an annual update of the Climate Action Plan 2019, and for a series

of 5-year national climate action strategies, as well as a series of 5-year carbon budgets.

It specifically provides that local authorities shall, within twelve months of the receipt of a

request from the Minister, make a climate action plan for the local authority. Local

authorities, in particular, have a pivotal role to play in the decarbonisation transition,

including through spatial planning, the provision of public housing and transport

infrastructure, and the maintenance of biodiversity. Under the Act, each must now prepare

their own Climate Action Plans. These plans are to cover both mitigation and adaptation, and

must be updated at least once every five years. The local authority climate action plan must

have regard to the most recent approved national long-term climate action strategy; the most

recent approved sectoral adaptation plans; and any policies of the Minister or the

Government on climate change.

While no Ministerial direction or guidelines as to the content of the local authority climate

action plan have as yet been received, it is highly likely that the focus of the of the Council’s

climate action plan will be on our significant energy users – public lighting, fleet and buildings.

Limerick is among the first wave of counties to be included in the RMO-led Public Lighting

Energy Efficiency Project, which will see low efficiency public lights being replaced by energy

efficient LED lighting, which will result in emissions reductions and energy and maintenance

cost savings to the Council.

Public sector bodies have been obliged to achieve a 33% reduction in energy use over the

period 2010 to 2020 inclusive, against a 2009 baseline. The Council’s energy reduction over

the period 2010 to 2019 inclusive is 28%, which is in line with the overall public sector total

for the same period. The target for 2030 is to achieve a 50% reduction against the 2009

baseline. In order to achieve this, the CAP 2021 includes provisions for the deep retrofit of

public sector buildings and the transition of public sector fleets to electric and low emissions

fuels.

We are currently making preparations in advance of the Ministerial direction to commence

the climate action plan process.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many housing applications have been removed, in total,***

***to date due to failure to return the SSHA (Summary of Social Housing Assessments) form***

***and if this accounts for the sudden drop in numbers of people on the housing waiting list as***

***per the Chief Executives Report for November.***

**REPLY:**

214 housing applications were closed following the SSHA 2021, there was a

variety of reasons why the applications were closed, as listed below:

 180 closed due to lack of response

 11 over income threshold

 7 no longer interested in Social Housing

 7 deceased, RIP

 3 whereabouts unknown.

 2 transferring Housing Authority

 2 change of circumstances

 2 left administrative area

The figures for the Chief Executive’s Report from October to December:

 2,447 in October 2021

 2,074 in November 2021 (down 373)

 2,109 in December 2021 (up 35)---
16

The figures change from closures of housing applications due to the SSHA,

applicants being housed and applicants being approved for social housing,

hence the list goes up and down all the time.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many houses and apartments have been bought by***

***Limerick City and County Council using Compulsory Purchase Orders in the last two years.***

**REPLY:**

The Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as amended) states that it is the duty of every

owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land

does not become, or does not continue to be, a derelict site.

The Act also states that it shall be the duty of a Local Authority to take all

reasonable steps (including the exercise of any appropriate statutory powers)

to ensure that any land situate in its functional area does not become, or

continue to be, a derelict site.

Since 2019, Limerick City and County Council has served 174 no. Notices under

Section 15 of the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as amended) to compulsorily acquire

derelict properties.

As of 18th January, 2021, a total of 121 no. properties have been compulsorily

acquired and vested in Limerick City and County Council under Section 17/18

of the Act. There are also other cases at various stages of acquisition, including

applications lodged with An Bord Pleanála for determination on foot of

objections received.

Of the 121 no. sites already acquired, these comprise of 130 no. housing units

in varying stages of dereliction.

Through the Housing Act, 1966, the Council has used Compulsory Purchase

Orders to acquire 6 no. units for social housing and 2 no. further units are due

for vesting.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council has hired a full-time Vacant***

***Homes Officer and, if so, what duties have they been assigned.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has a full-time Vacant Homes Officer position

since 2018. The current post-holder is Mr. David O’Grady. The post is based

in the Property and Community Facilities Department of the Community,

Tourism and Culture Directorate.---

Renew Scheme, the Repair and Lease Scheme, the Living City Tax Initiative,

energy and retrofit grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland,

and the Council’s own Paint Scheme operational in towns and villages of the

county.

The Vacant Homes Officer engages with property owners on their duties under

14.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

***FI will ask at the next Meeting what the process is in relation to a landlord and their property***

***failing a number of HAP inspections and any follow up inspections: (a) has the Council***

***initiated any enforcement orders on private HAP rental properties in the past three years;***

***(b) how does the Council respond to multiple failed inspections under the HAP/RAS Scheme;***

***(c) has the Council stopped any HAP payments to Landlord, due to the standards of a***

***property, in the past three years.***

**REPLY:**

(a) The Council has initiated enforcement procedures on private rented houses.

(b) Improvement Letters may be an appropriate initial response, where minor

contraventions of the Regulations were noted following inspection. An Improvement

Notice can be served if one or more of the following criteria apply: (i) The conditions

of the rented house are unacceptable and there are significant contraventions of

legislation; (ii) Where action needs to be taken in order to remedy conditions that are

serious or deteriorating; or (iii) There is a history of non-compliance with other

measures such as Improvement Letters.

Where a landlord fails to comply with an Improvement Notice, the Inspector may

serve a Prohibition Notice and may consider instituting legal proceedings.

to the standards of a property.

15.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

***I will ask at the next Meeting has Limerick City and County Council completed fire safety***

***inspections of apartment blocks in Limerick City in the past four years, including the***

***following apartment buildings: Palmerstown Court, Strand Apartments, Mount Kenneth,***

***Jutland Hall, Riverpoint, The Steeples, Brookfield Hall (Castletroy), The Park (Edward Street,***

***Limerick).***---
18

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council Fire Authority operates under the Fire

Services Act (1981 and 2003).

Responsibility for fire safety in buildings rests with the owners and occupiers

of buildings. This is set out in Section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act which places

a duty on every person having control over premises to take all reasonable

measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on such premises and to ensure,

as far as reasonably practicable, the safety of persons on the premises in the

event of an outbreak of fire.

Limerick City and County Council implements a comprehensive programme of

inspections under the Fire Services Act (1981 and 2003). The majority of the

inspections under the Fire Services Act are as a result of complaints from the

general public, pre-event inspections and pre-court inspections for licensing.

Furthermore, the Fire Authority can request that owners and occupiers carry

out their own Fire Safety Risk Assessment of their premises. Operational Fire

Service personnel can also undertake familiarisation visits to premises.

Limerick Fire Service has carried out 39 inspections on 30 premises containing

flats/apartments in Limerick over the last four years. Where a resident has any

concerns regarding fire safety in their premises, they should contact the owner

or management company in the first instance. Failing that, they may contact

the Fire Department regarding the matter.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

***I will ask at the next Meeting why has Limerick City and County Council raised the price of***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council carried out a review of the charges for burial

grounds in 2021. These charges had not been reviewed in the past six years.

Revenue from the sale of graves is used to support the operation and

maintenance of the graveyard service.

17.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

***I will ask at the next Meeting when will the proposed Flood Relief Scheme for Castleconnell***

progressing Stage 1 – Scheme Development and Design. The Scheme is

currently at Options Assessment with Cost Benefit Analysis and Multi-Criteria

NOTICES OF MOTION

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

***I will move at the next Meeting that the response time for removal of graffiti be examined***

***and speeded up due to the significant lag in its removal.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor McSweeney.

**REPLY:**

We are currently engaged in a procurement process for graffiti removal. As

part of this process, we will be including a requirement for prompt removal of

graffiti where this is feasible and appropriate. While there may still be locations

that mitigate against prompt removal by virtue of their location, access or type,

it is agreed that prompt removal, where possible, is desirable. We will review

this approach at the end of each year to ensure the most effective approach is

in place.

Data Protection Commission decision on use of CCTV in Limerick

The Mayor explained how he had agreed to allow for a presentation to be given to the

Members at the end of the Meeting, following on from the recent decision by the Office of

the Data Protection Commission in relation to CCTV cameras. He welcomed the Head of

Digital Strategy to the Meeting to give a presentation on the Office of the Data Protection

Commission decision on the use of CCTV in Limerick.

**Suspension of Standing Orders:** It was noted that the time was approaching 5.30pm and on

the proposal of Councillor J. Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Teskey, it was agreed to

suspend Standing Orders to allow for the Meeting to continue to facilitate the presentation

to the Members on the recent decision by the Office of the Data Protection Commission in

relation to CCTV cameras.

As the Mayor had to leave the Meeting, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded

by Councillor Collins (M), the Deputy Mayor, Councillor Ruddle, took the Chair for the

remainder of the Meeting.

The Head of Digital Strategy confirmed that Limerick City and County Council had recently

been fined €110,000 by the Office of the Data Protection Commission. He also confirmed

that the local authority had been instructed to bring its data processing in terms of its CCTV

systems, into line with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), in relation to 357 of the

401 cameras that it operates across Limerick City and County. This decision would also have

major implications for other local authorities who operated CCTV cameras.

He outlined the background and timelines in relation to the decision and that:

•

The audit by the DPC commenced on the 25th June 2018;

•

The draft inquiry report was issued to Limerick City and County Council for review on

8th July 2019;

•

A submission in response to the draft inquiry report was sent to the DPC on the 20th

September 2019;

•

Limerick City and County Council received the final report on 13th December, 2020;

•

Legal advice received, following receipt of the final report, was not to appeal the

decision;

•

The DPC had accepted Limerick City and County Council s request that all timelines be

extended to 120 days from receipt of report;

•

That the 12th April, 2022 was the final date by which all remediation actions were to

be completed by the local authority.

He outlined how CCTV cameras had evolved in Limerick and also explained that statutory

provisions in Ireland around the provision of CCTV cameras are broadly pitched, and that the

understanding was that this could provide the legal basis for it. However, he advised that the

Office of the Data Protection Commission had now determined that they are not a legal basis.

He also confirmed that remedial actions to resolve the issues had already commenced

involving a team including the Head of Digital Services, the Data Protection Officer,---
22

representatives from O’Flynn Exhams Solicitor’s firm (data privacy specialists) and Arup

(public realm CCTV experts) and remedial actions included:

•

Complete Data Protection Impact Assessments for all cameras;

•

Complete Data Protection Impact Assessment on Monitoring Centre in Moyross;

•

Brief the CCTV oversight committee;

•

Apply private dwelling masking on all relevant cameras;

•

Erect signage, where missing;

•

Extensive engagement with An Garda Siochana including signed letter of approval

from local Garda Divisional Officers, Joint Data Controller agreement between the

Council & An Garda Síochána;

•

Complete Data Protection Impact Assessment;

•

Review and update Limerick City & County Council CCTV Policy and website;

•

Report back to Data Protection Commissioner on actions completed.

The Members thanked the Head of Digital Services for his presentation to them in relation to

this. They expressed their disappointment in relation to the decision made by the Office of

the Data Protection Commission and agreed that the provision of CCTV cameras were

supported by the vast majority of the population, as they helped to provide reassurance and

security for all law abiding citizens going about their daily activities. They agreed that

significant investment was made to provide cameras which are an important tool in assisting

both the local authority and An Garda Siochana in dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour,

and that this decision would benefit criminals rather than the general population.

The Members agreed that the legislation in this area, or lack thereof, had contributed to the

current issues, as there did not appear to be clarity in relation to the legal requirements for

the provision of CCTV cameras. They stressed the urgency for Oireachtas members in

addressing this to ensure that adequate legislation would be put in place to facilitate the legal

provision of CCTV cameras.

The Members also expressed disappointment at the lack of information provided to them by

Management leading up to this decision by the Office of the Data Protection Commission, and

at the size of the fine imposed on the local authority. They noted the response from the

Deputy Chief Executive and Director, Support Services that the decision to not appeal the fine

was based on specialist legal advice and had been made in a tight timeframe over the

Christmas period. They also welcomed the remedial actions being taken to address the issues

raised by the Office of the Data Protection Commission and highlighted the importance of

meeting the final deadline of the 12th April, 2022.

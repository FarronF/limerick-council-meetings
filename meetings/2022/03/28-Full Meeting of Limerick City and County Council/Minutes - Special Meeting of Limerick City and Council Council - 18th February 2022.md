Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028

The Mayor welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting and noted that it was an important

day in the Development Plan Making process, where the Draft Plan and Chief Executive’s

Report on submissions made during the public display on the Draft Plan would be considered.

The Chief Executive outlined how this Development Plan will set out a blueprint to guide the

development of Limerick, in a planned and coherent manner in the coming years. He

explained how the review of the existing Development Plan commenced in August 2020 and

had progressed throughout the pandemic. He confirmed that extensive consultation was

undertaken throughout the summer of 2021 on the Draft Development Plan, adapting

practices to ensure that all sectors of society had an opportunity to get involved in the

process. This included webinars, development of a virtual room, meetings held on Zoom

Meetings etc. This process culminated in 285 submission received on the Draft Plan, all of
---
which are summarised in the Chief Executive’s Report, with the response and

recommendation of the Chief Executive on each issue raised.

The Chief Executive thanked the Elected Members of the Council, Management and staff in

the Forward Planning Department for their hard work and dedication in progressing the Plan

to this stage. He looked forward to engaging further with the Elected Members to complete

the next stage of the process and working towards adopting the unified Limerick

Development Plan 2022 -2028, in the summer of 2022.

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning then went on to explain how the process

of the Meeting would take place and how each proposed amendment would be considered

**from Agriculture to Residential zoning of 2.4ha. in Clonmacken, South of the Condell Road.**

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J). Cllr

Hartigan proposed that the amendment not be made due to concerns that this land may be

part of a flood plain, which was seconded by Cllr Novak.

The Members referred to the conflicting reports in relation to flood plains and where this

leaves public representatives, where one report says it is a flood zone and another has

reasons to oppose this. They agreed that it was important that clarification was sought on

this and that it would be interesting to see what the OPR will say on the lands designated as

flood risk, where contrary evidence is also there.

Members agreed that while the Elected Members may not have the required expertise in

this matter, that any proposed development would have to go through the planning process.

Members also noted the current housing crisis and that people are struggling to buy a house

and the importance of zoning lands to meet the housing targets.

The Senior Planner responded that the Local Authority engaged consultants to carry out a

Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to inform the plan and the site is identified as Flood Zone A.

The Senior Planner noted that the Material Alterations will go out on public display and be

sent to prescribed bodies who will comment on the proposed Material Alterations to the

plan.

Some Members referred to the flood report stating that the site comes in under three

different categories, and not all within Flood Zone A. The Senior Planner noted that any land

that came in under Flood Zone C was already zoned as residential in the Draft Plan, but if it
---
came in under Flood Zone A or B, it was considered high risk and the planning authority did

not consider it appropriate to zone a vulnerable use on these lands.

Following these discussions, the Mayor directed that a vote be taken on the proposal from

Cllr Hartigan that the amendment not be made, and the result of the voting was as follows:

**In Favour**

Councillors Hartigan, Novak.

**(2)**

**Against**

Councillors Butler, Carey, Collins (J), Collins (M), Daly, Donegan, Egan, Foley, Keary, Kiely,

Kilcoyne, Leddin, McSweeney, Mitchell, Murphy, O’Brien, O’Dea, O’Donoghue, O’Hanlon,

**land as Serviced Sites in Ballingarry Village (Submission on behalf of O’Connell family)**

**Objective IN O10 Surface Water and SuDS and Development Management Standard**

**Section 11.3.11 SuDS re Greenroofs.**

The Amendment was proposed by Cllr. O’Donoghue, seconded by Cllr. O’Brien. Cllr Hartigan

proposed that the original wording should be retained, as the proposed revised wording to

encourage, rather than require, has lesser impact. He stated that the provision of green

roofs can result in savings and that they are now a standard practice in most countries. His

proposal was seconded by Cllr Novak. Some Members stated that Cllr. O’Donoghue’s

proposed amendment was reasonable and Members also agreed that the public needed to

be made more aware of all potential energy saving proposals and be encouraged, rather

than mandated, into availing of same. Following these discussions, the Mayor directed that
---
a vote be taken on the proposal from Cllr Hartigan that the amendment not be made and

the result of the voting was as follows:

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor O’Brien. Cllr

the recommendation by the Executive is that it is not proposed that it be amended, as part of

this site is in a flood zone. Cllr Hartigan proposed that the amendment not be made due to

concerns that this land may be part of a flood plain, which was seconded by Cllr Novak.

and asked for the Executive’s opinion on this amendment. The Senior Planner explained that

there was no submission on this site, but that this amendment is coming in under a general

submission relating to Level 5 and Level 6 Settlement. She also noted that there was criteria

to be met for a settlement to come in under Level 6 and that the Executive have concerns in

relation to the proliferation of septic tanks in the vicinity of the proposed settlement.

Cllr Hartigan proposed that the amendment not be made due to these concerns, which was

The Amendment proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor Slattery was

approved.

**Amendment No. 31: Amendment submitted by Cllr. Kieran O’Hanlon –** **Extend the**

**boundary of the Annacotty Business Park**

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor Collins (M)

Cllr. Hartigan referred to the existing road network from Cappamore Junction and the issue

with over capacity on this road, as well as insufficient footpath capacity. He believed that

this was not sustainable development and that the local residents were opposed to it.

Other Members stated that they supported the proposed amendment having regard to

potential job creation opportunities, and that some businesses in the Business Park want to

expand and current zoning doesn’t allow it. Members noted the concerns raised by local

residents in relation to increased traffic levels and agreed that the current infrastructure is

lacking as is, and that there needs to be an overall plan for road infrastructure and the

impact the Limerick Northern Distributor Road would have on it.

Some Members also noted the lack of public transport serving the site, and the width of the

road, which needed to be addressed before any extension should be considered. Some

Members also noted that the flyover is quite narrow and that the railway crossing before

the Industrial Estate is an issue. The A/Director, Economic Development & Enterprise

confirmed that the Executive were aware of issues in relation to the road network and that

works were carried out on it over the last two years, including improvements and speed

reduction. He stated that if the land were zoned, the applicant would require a traffic

impact assessment, which would also include proposed improvements carried out by either

the applicant or the LA. The Director also referred to the recent Part 8 Approval to carry out

road improvements at the Annacotty- Cappamore Junction.

Cllr O’Hanlon stated that he was aware of some of the concerns raised and noted the

feedback from Members during the discussion. He proposed that an amendment be made

to the proposal, namely a proposed extension of the Business Park site to 7.348ha, rather

than the originally proposed extension size of 40.15ha. This proposed change was seconded

by Cllr. Michael Collins.

Cllr Hartigan proposed that no amendment be agreed to increase the boundary in any size of

the Business Park, and this was seconded by Cllr Secas. Following these discussions, the Mayor

directed that a vote be taken on the proposal from Cllr Hartigan that the amendment not be

made and the result of the voting was as follows:

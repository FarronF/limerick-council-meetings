the strategy?

Mr. Hayes in response to Cllr. Kiely (1) yes this can be considered and (2) AHB’s tenancies

- Cllr. Joe Leddin asked if the Community Sustainment Team can write to tenants informing

them of their Community Sustainment Team contact? Mr. Hayes, advised that contact

information for the unit is available in the tenant's handbook and that they will consider

sending this information out with the tenant rent statements.

- Cllr. Joe Leddin enquired about the eviction process. Mr. Hayes explained the process,

advised that it is slow and not easy to achieve a repossession order and that exclusion

orders are much more effective.

(2) if there are key performance indicators (KPI’s) to inform the strategy and (3)

highlighted that scrambler bikes are a serious danger and nuisance.

closely with the Community Gardaí (2) that the Council are open to looking at any

successful community models. Mr. Hayes highlighted the various supports the Council

provides to tenants and that the Council encourages and supports the establishment of

resident's associations within Council estates, (3) Limerick City and County Council can

progress such complaints through the AHB and (4) to contact the Community

Sustainment Unit within the Council and provide as much detail as possible

- Ms. Anne Cronin, Sectoral Representative Community/Voluntary asked if the issue of

scramblers can be included in the new Anti-Social Behaviour Strategy and referred to a

National Transport Authority report on the design of housing estates and speed. Mr.

Hayes informed Ms. Cronin that the tenant’s obligations are set out in their letting

agreement and in the tenant handbook and that the Council work closely with tenants.

scramblers.

**Item 4:** **Re** **Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Newcastle West –**

**Councillors J. Sheahan (Proposer), M. Collins, F. Foley, L. Galvin, T. Ruddle, J. Scanlan**

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Newcastle West – Councillors J.

Sheahan (Proposer), M. Collins, F. Foley, L. Galvin, T. Ruddle, J. Scanlan

“We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council change its

Housing Allocation Scheme.”

A discussion took place and the main points were:

- Mr. Conor Culloo, Senior Engineer clarified that the intention behind the Notice of

Motion (NOM) was the issue around the length of time taken from when the dwelling

becomes vacant to when it is re-tenanted and not the Allocation Policy itself, which

specifically refers to the assessment of prospective tenants. Consequently, this refers to

the operational response to the return of a dwelling once it becomes vacant and as such

is an Executive Function. For these reasons Mr. Culloo recommended that the NOM

would not be referred to full Council, this was agreed.

It was proposed to deal with the intention of the motion that a small working group

within the SPC would review the operational process around the return of dwellings (key

to key) and revert with a report at the next SPC meeting.

A copy of the report will be forwarded to the Newcastle West Municipal District for

information once it has been completed. NCW MD to be advised of above in relation to

NOM.

consultation and next steps.

- Cllr. Benson welcomed same and advised that Tipperary County Council have an effective

Housing One Rep Policy.

- Cllr. Sheehan asked if an online version of the GDPR protocol could be made available.

- Cllr. Kiely added that there should be an online facility and that Councillors should have

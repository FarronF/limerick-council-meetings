Notices of Motion

7.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that

Limerick City and County Council cut and trim back the trees hedges and verges of all the

rural secondary narrow roads where vision is impaired due to lush growth over the

summer months for all road users in the interests of health safety and furthermore carry

out an immediate inspection and review of speed signs with a view to replace faded

signs and reduce speed limits from 80 Kilometres to 50 kilometres or less where

necessary.

**Proposed: Councillor Mitchell**

**Seconded: Councillor Egan**

**Reply:**

The responsibility for the maintenance of non-national road public road hedgerows and

verges is a matter for individual landowners. Limerick City and County Council as the

Road Authority has responsibility to maintain such vegetation on National Roads only. If

specific locations are identified, the relevant landowners can be contacted to maintain

the vegetation on their roadside boundaries.

Road signage, in particular regulatory signage is reviewed regularly. The Municipal

District Office is currently replacing signage on a priority basis across the district.

A new county wide review of speed limits across the public road network will commence

in Q4 this year and continue into 2023.---
8.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Egan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that

speed limits of 80kmh on local roads be reviewed and reduced as appropriate.

**Proposed: Councillor Egan**

**Seconded: Councillor Mitchell**

**Reply:**

Speed Limits on all public roads irrespective of road class are reviewed on a county wide

basis every five years. To ensure consistency of speed limits across the entire public road

network in Ireland, Local authorities are obliged to review speed limits in accordance

with the Department of Transport document “Guidelines for Setting and Managing

Speed Limits in Ireland”. A new county wide review commence in Q4 this year and

continue into 2023.

*The Senior Executive Engineer addressed both of the above Notices of Motion outlining*

*that speed limits are governed by National legislation, and that enforcement of speed*

*limits and traffic calming measures are also required in tandem with speed limits.*

*The SEE requested that the Elected Members make him aware of any specific locations*

*where speed was an issue, and that submissions be made under the County wide review*

*which will be commencing in Q4 2022.*

*It was suggested by Councillor M Ryan that this issue be brought to the next JPC meeting*

*for discussion.*

9.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

I will move at next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District following a

request from South Limerick Branch of the Irish Red Cross that a Council Building or

Council property in Kilmallock be made available for a permanent base for the Branch.

**Proposed: Councillor Teefy**

**Seconded: Councillor Mitchell.**

**Reply:**

Vacant properties in Kilmallock under Limerick City and County Council ownership tend

to be properties acquired under the Derelict Sites Act 1990, all of which are in need of

significant capital investment. These properties are brought back to the open market for

sale once the vesting process has completed.

It is not clear as to the type of property that would be required by the South Limerick

Branch of the Irish Red Cross, so I would recommend that a detailed report be submitted

to Limerick City and County Council’s Property Department (email:---
tinaknox@limerick.ie) with further details of the requirements in relation to the desired

property type, property size and level of investment should be addressed.

Once a more detailed report has been received, the Property Department will review

and revert.

*Councillor Teefy advised the Elected Members present that the preference for the South*

*Limerick branch of the Red Cross would be in the Business Park, and that an email to that*

*effect would be sent to the Property Department as per the reply above.*

10.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District calling

on Limerick City and County Council to employ a landscaping contractor to assist local

community cemetery associations with necessary grass cutting and general maintenance

at our local cemeteries.

**Proposed: Councillor Donegan**

**Seconded: Councillor Mitchell**

**Reply:**

The Council already assists local communities with the maintenance of cemeteries with

the provision of an annual maintenance grant of €450. The Council increased the grant

from €300 to €450 in 2022. This annual grant assists maintenance committees in

maintaining 82no. cemeteries in the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District.

The Council may, subject to resources, be in a position to consider providing assistance

in an isolated situation, where a cemetery is a large open green area. The Council can

request the grass cutting contractor to provide assistance in this instance.

*Councillor Donegan wished to acknowledge the work undertaken by the voluntary*

*committees maintaining the cemeteries, and outlined that many of the cemetery*

*committees require additional supports besides funding, including manual labour*

*supports, as they are finding it hard to recruit younger members.*

11.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District for

funding to be made available for the felling of dangerous trees at Kilfinane

Cemetery.

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**---
**Reply:**

There are a number of mature trees in Kilfinane Graveyard. The Council will arrange

a tree condition survey to determine the extent of danger posed by the trees.

Depending on the findings, the Council will take the appropriate actions as

recommended in the survey.

QUESTIONS

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District for an

update on relocation of existing pedestrian crossing and traffic calming measures in

Hospital. The volume of traffic through Hospital town is increasing at a rapid rate. I

do not want to see any more accidents, this has now become an immediate priority

as new businesses are opening up which is positive news. This is urgent.

**Reply:**

The relocation of the pedestrian crossing from the main street forms part of overall

improvements to the Knockainey road junction, Hospital. The civil works for the

completed before the end of November.

accidents.

**Reply:**

will be completed shortly. Once this report is reviewed, the Municipal District Office

will be making a submission to the NTA via the Limerick Active Travel Office for

funding to carry out improvements in 2023.

The development of the site to provide community facilities is an objective for the

Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District Office. The site is owned by a number of

the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended) related to

development by or on behalf of a local authority.

Article 80(1)(a) of the regulations prescribes “ *the construction or erection of a*

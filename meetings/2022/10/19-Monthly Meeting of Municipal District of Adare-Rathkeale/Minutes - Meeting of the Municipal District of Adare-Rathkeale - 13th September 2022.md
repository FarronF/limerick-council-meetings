**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will move at the next Meeting to call on the National Transport Authority (NTA) to**

**provide bus shelters for the elderly and disabled in Askeaton and to facilitate suitable**

**access to public transport at each end of the town.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Keary and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan requested if the National Transport

Authority would visit Askeaton to establish suitable locations for bus shelters in Askeaton.

Councillor Keary also requested they visit Rathkeale to inspect the bus shelters there.

Councillor O’Donoghue also requested if a representative from the Local Link Rural Bus

would attend a District Meeting to clarify how the service operates.

**REPLY:**

The request for improved bus services in Askeaton is acknowledged,

particularly as it relates to the elderly/infirm. While the Council are not

directly responsible for bus scheduling, this being a matter for the NTA/Bus

Eireann, we will endeavour to liaise with both aforementioned parties to

see if requested improvements can be actioned.

We note that the NTA are currently examining their service scheduling in

Limerick and we will ask for Askeaton to be included in the review. Note

that direct representations from Elected Members to the NTA may be

helpful also to gain traction for upgrade in services.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will ensure that**

**all grass verges on roads without an adequate hard shoulder, footpath or cycle lane**

**within 3km of national schools and 5km of secondary schools should be maintained to**

**a depth of 1m from the edge of the tar on a year round basis.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Keary and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donoghue highlighted the dangers of the restriction

of cutting hedges between March and September in areas surrounding rural schools.

Councillor Keary also added trimming of grass verges on roads should not be restricted in

order to ensure rural roads are safer to travel on.

**REPLY:**

Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 places responsibility for the maintenance

of roadside hedges on the owners/occupiers of the adjoining lands.

The responsibility for the maintenance of roadside verges rest with the local

authority.

Generally, given the extensive road network and funding issues, it is Council

Policy that cutting verges has a low priority compared with other road

maintenance elements. Where work is carried out, priority is given to sight-

lines at junctions or obstruction to road signs. Drainage works are carried

out to verges also as required. As a partner the Council has to take into

account the objectives of the All Ireland Pollinator Plan.

The Council will consider any particular problematic location but schools

should engage with the Safe Route to Schools Programme and/or Active

Travel teams.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council contact the**

**Department of Education, Transport and any other relevant Government Departments**

**with a view to educating people on road safety. The purpose of this campaign would**

**be to remind motorists, cyclist and pedestrians of our duty of care to each other on our**

**roads and also to educate anybody who has recently moved to this country.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Collins and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donoghue stated there should be a re-education

programme available to all road users. Councillor Collins also added people who use an

electric scooter on the public roads should have to purchase a licence and insurance as

well as wear a helmet and hi-visibility jacket.

**REPLY:**

The Road Safety Authority together with the Road Safety Education Officer

of Limerick City and County Council promote road safety awareness in the

City and County through a number of educational initiatives.

This involves working with local stakeholders, the Gardaí, emergency

services and the Department of Education to raise awareness among all

road users in every way possible to save lives and prevent injuries by

helping to reduce the number and severity of collisions on Irish roads.

large amounts of traffic, near a large primary school.

The Members raised a number of queries in relation to possible delays for emergency services

vehicles accessing the nearby University Hospital Limerick; the removal of the set down area

outside the school and the impact that this may have on adjoining estates. They also expressed

concerns regarding the proposal that buses would stop on the road, rather than in a designated set

down area, which they believed would add to traffic issues and delays.

Disability Strategy Plan 2022 as follows:

Objective PO4: To support and promote the use of Universal Design principles, adaptable

housing design and Lifetime Homes in new housing developments to meet the needs of

diverse groups and an aging population.

On Council-led new-build social housing schemes, there is a target to design 15% of the

overall number of units to a Universal Design (UD) standard. The UD standard will apply to
---

schemes being initiated now. The UD standard offers a wheelchair-liveable home and will

cater for the widest range of potential tenants. In February 2022, the Department of Local

Government and Housing launched the Design Manual for Quality Housing. It includes

typical internal layouts for UD homes, which the Council will utilise and are available to view

at the following link:

https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b3e02-design-manual-for-quality-housing

**17.Question submitted by Councillor T. Collopy**

***I will ask this Council, to confirm the number of applicants on the housing list with a need for***

***specially adapted housing/wheelchair liveable home, and to advise what the average and the***

***longest waiting times an applicant with disabilities would expect to wait for housing.***

**REPLY:** The number of applicants on the housing list approved on medical grounds as wheelchair

users/possible wheelchair users in the future is 50.

The number of applicants on the housing list approved on medical grounds requiring ground

floor accommodation or special adaptations is 145.

The waiting times are subject to a number of variables including the following:

 Areas of Choice selected – applicants can have up to 3 areas of choice

 Household composition and number of bedrooms required

 Suitability of properties available

**18.Question submitted by Councillor T. Collopy**

***I will ask this Council, how many applicants with a need for specially adapted housing/wheelchair***

***liveable home, were housed from the housing list, not including transfers or existing tenants, in***

***the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 to date.***

**REPLY:** For the years 2019 to 2021, applicants were identified under a medical classification criteria.

However, they were not sub-categorised into specific wheelchair needs on our iHouse

system. Each applicant was then considered based on their individual needs when being

assessed for housing.

From 2022 our recording system has been modified to capture greater detail of the medical

classification i.e., wheelchair bound etc.

There are four applicants who are wheelchair bound that were housed in specially adapted

properties from January 2022 to June 2022 inclusive.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask**at the next Meeting**of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council Executive have***

***had any further engagement on the Horizon Mall site on the Dublin Road, if there are any plans***

**REPLY:** The Council has received preliminary enquiries regarding the site, however pre-planning

consultation has not been requested to date. The Council notes the comments as made

regarding the fence and will seek to raise this issue as part of any future engagement.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the city***

***centre festoon lighting? Is this lightning from a sustainable and energy efficient source and to ask***

***if such lighting can be installed permanently around the Parnell Street/Davis Street area.***

**REPLY*:*** The existing festoon lights on the Three Bridges River Walk are 5.5w LED bulbs (which is in

the order of 50% more efficient that previous technology). Following a number of trials,

these lights were chosen as the most efficient option when considering energy efficiency,

the desired lighting effect and durability. The Three Bridges River Walk will continue to be

maintained subject to budgetary constraints and further reviews of the energy uses within

Limerick City and County Council.

However, given the current energy crisis and subsequent observations made by Minister

Eamon Ryan regarding the responsibilities of the public sector to conserve energy, as well

as the targets set out in the Paris Agreement for 2030 and 2050, it is currently not envisaged

that additional festoon lighting will be installed within Limerick City and County Council.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on current***

***plan of works for O’Con**nell Street revitalisation? To ask when these plans were revised and what***

***changes have been made from the plans that were approved by Councillors in October 2019.***

**REPLY:** Construction work is ongoing on the O’Connell Street Revitalisation project. Limerick City

and County Council has received the latest construction programme from the contractor for

the works which indicates a project completion date of Friday 25 November.

Should there be any change to this schedule, the Council has decided on the following

contingency plan being put in place ahead of the Christmas period.

 All contract works are to cease on site on Friday 25 November in accordance with the

contractor’s programmed end date, having due consideration for the critical business

period of December with any remaining works to recommence in January 2023.

The plan for O’Connell Street is being implemented in line with the approved scheme

including the modification requesting the addition of one cycle lane. The Scheme has also

further been considered in the context of emerging Government policy on sustainable

transport and in the context of the draft Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Strategy

(LSMATS). This strategy identifies O’Connell Street as a dual direction cycle route. The design

has included provision for this option. A planning exemption for local authorities to deliver

cycling facilities is provided for under an amendment to the Planning Act. Modification to

the landscaping scheme have occurred during the construction stage based on restrictions

posed by ground conditions, location of existing services, etc.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**
---
11

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on***

***revitalisation plans for**the Nicholas Street area and the possibility of restricting motor vehicle***

***access in evening times for this area.***

**REPLY:** The current focus of plans for Nicholas Street is street enhancements that can be delivered

in the short-term following on from major capital work carried out on No. 24 & 25 (Treaty

City Brewery building), 26 and 27 (Men’s Shed) Nicholas Street and the Fireplace Site.

Examples of this included enhanced landscape treatment, provision of street planters, etc.

This approach will broaden to consider medium term interventions and longer term

strategic placemaking approach, building on the improvement to this area of the city over

recent years. This forms part of a “place-based approach” to the continued development of

the area. A number of temporary road closures are proposed on part of Nicholas Street in

2022 and 2023 related to specific events, e.g., Culture Night. These road closures will be

assessed to inform how the use of the street can evolve to the maximum benefit of the area

and wider city.

**23.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***following Active Travel project: LCC/20/0002 City Centre Traffic Management Plan.***

**REPLY:** The National Transport Authority (NTA) has recently appointed a consultant to undertake a

feasibility analysis for the future bus network for Limerick. The feasibility will examine the

existing network and examine options for a redesign of the future bus network for Limerick.

A key element of the design will be a traffic management plan for the city centre and the

plan will include and integrate all modes of transport. The bus network feasibility is due to

commence in early October 2022.

**24.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick the measures the Chief***

***Executive is putting in place to reduce the Council’s energy usage in light of the increasing energy***

***prices internationally.***

**REPLY**: Facilities:

LCCC employ the use of Building Management Systems (BMS) in City Hall, County Hall and

Lissanalta House. These systems enable control of office temperatures as well as plant and

equipment run times, going forward LCCC will implement Wintertime settings on these

systems as directed by the Dept. of Environment, Climate and Communications which will

aim to reduce equipment run times and office temperatures when and where appropriate.

Since the beginning of 2022 LCCC have replaced approx. 150 no. fluorescent light fittings

with LED fittings in City Hall and will continue to upgrade any remaining fittings over the

coming months in order to drive further energy efficiencies.

LCCC will also host events in City Hall and County Hall as part of Energy Awareness Week

between 26th and 30th September where we will advise Council employees to switch off
---
12

unnecessary lighting at our offices when not required and will also staff to power down

their IT and other equipment when leaving their workplace daily.

Public Lighting:

The remit of the public lighting section is to maintain and operate the existing public lighting

network and to ensure any new lights being installed, as part of standalone schemes and/or

developments meet the necessary standards Limerick City and County Council require.

Repairs involve the replacement of existing SOX and SONs fittings with LED fittings which in

turn provide an approximate 50% decrease in energy usage and all new installations also

meet this standard.

As the Members are aware Limerick City and County Council are currently engaged in

the Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project for the South West Region. This project will

look to replace all the existing non energy efficient light fittings with LED replacements

thereby ensuring that the public lighting network energy usage is as efficient as feasibly

possible. This project is due in Limerick in August 2023.

Machinery Yard:

The Machinery Yard team carry out ongoing reviews of their energy and fleet management

to ensure an efficient operation is maintained. Some examples of measures undertaken

include the logistical planning of the fleet operations to minimise the distances travelled,

proactive maintenance of vehicles, replacement of older vehicles with more economic

vehicles and ongoing monitoring of fuel consumption & vehicle efficiency.

In addition to the day-to-day measures outlined above it is also planned to trial Electric

Vehicles for metro-based operations of light commercial vehicles and recently Arup

consulting engineers have also been engaged to analyse fleet usage and identify EV

opportunities

Energy Efficiency Measures:

LCCC participates in the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) energy tenders to secure

the most economic rates for electricity and gas. LCCC attained certification to ISO 50001

Energy Management System in 2018. LCCC exceeded the 33% public sector target for 2020,

achieving 44% energy efficiency. LCCC has been providing Staff Awareness information and

some specific training on Energy efficiency and renewable energy. Next Staff energy

awareness day takes place on September 28th.

31. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the local authority***

***review the operational measures in place for the casual trading area outside The Limerick Milk***

***Market. This is so as to ensure that the casual trading area is utilised fully, that adequate traffic***

***control measures are in place on casual trading days, and that appropriate lines of***

***communication are in place to co-ordinate activities on casual trading days between the local***

***authority and Limerick Market Trustees.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kiely highlighted the success of the Milk Market and in

particular for tourism in the city. She stated a number of issues needed to be addressed in the

casual trading area outside the Market. Members welcomed the Motion and agreed that it is

known as an excellent market and an important tourist attraction. They agreed the importance of

fully co-ordinated operational measures between Limerick and the Milk Market for the causal

trading area outside the Milk Market so as to fully maximise the area and ensure its proper

management and co-ordination.

**REPLY**: The Council continually reviews and monitors the operation of the casual trading area

around the Milk Market. Staff of the Council are in attendance on Saturdays when the

market is in operation. These staff install the pedestrian barriers after traders have arrived

and are set up. These barriers restrict vehicular access and afford protection to visitors and

customers. New traders are being licensed all the time by our staff to ensure that all vacant

areas are occupied.

The staff of the Council liaise regularly with their counterparts in the Milk Market to

maximise the offering.

Following the reply to the Motion it was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor

O’Sullivan that a meeting be arranged between Limerick City and County Council and the Milk

Market Executive to discuss the outside area.

As the time was approaching 12.15pm it was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by

Councillor Butler to suspend Standing Orders in order to complete the agenda.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the urgent need for a new primary school in

Castletroy, with schools in the area currently at full capacity.

33. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

**I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for zebra crossings to be**

**installed at St. Michaels National School and the Barrington Street entrance to People’s Park to**

**provide safety for pedestrians in this area.**

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Talukder and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Donovan highlighted the need for a crossing in the area to

improve pedestrian access at St. Michaels National School and at the Barrington Street entrance to

People’s Park.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council has plans in place to complete a new raised table top

junction improvement at the intersection of Mallow Street and Perry Square as part of an

Active Travel junction tightening scheme before the end of the year, which will improve

pedestrian safety at the entrance to People’s Park.

Any further pedestrian crossings at St. Michaels National School or Barrington Street would

require a feasibility study and survey to determine if a pedestrian crossing is warranted. This

study will be considered once the Mallow Street / Perry Square junction improvement is

completed and if warranted, a pedestrian crossing at a suitable location in the area will be

considered subject to availability of funding through a possible Active Travel scheme.

Members expressed their dissatisfaction with the reply and stated that the plans for the new

junction at the intersection of Mallow Street and Perry Square was too far away from the primary

school. The Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing agreed to carry out a feasibility

study and revert in relation to the proposal.

It was anticipated that runners, having completed the Great Limerick Run, could gather and

utilise the park. This would help to utilise the park but also help to control the numbers in

Arthur’s Quay Park. However, the weather on Sunday 1 May 2022 was poor, contributing

to lower than expected numbers in the park.

**Riverfest 2023**

Tender for delivery of event management is currently out on eTenders with a closing date

of 29 September 2022.

Members noted the details of the reply and requested that a Presentation would be arranged in

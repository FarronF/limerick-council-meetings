The Executive Architect commenced by referring to the Chief Executive’s Report on the Part

8 application.

He stated that since the September Meeting of the Municipal District, further local

consultation had taken place with the residents on the Shanagolden/Newcastle West Road

and the residents of O’Connor Park, Ardagh. He outlined to the Members the concerns raised

by the residents and the Council’s response to the concerns raised.

He stated that funding has been received from the Department of Housing, Local Government

and Heritage and that it is hoped to progress the project to tender stage in Q1/Q2 2023 with

a build period of twelve to fifteen months.

The Members welcomed the proposed development but however expressed concern on a

number of matters including junction onto R521, safety at this junction and proposed

wastewater connection to the Ardagh Wastewater Treatment Plant.

In replying, the Senior Engineer stated that safety at the junction has been assessed by the

Council and that a Stage 1 and 2 Road Safety Audit will be carried out as part of the design

process.

In response to a query from the Members, the Senior Engineer referred to the Connection

Agreement which has been made with Irish Water with regard to proposed connection to the

Ardagh Wastewater Treatment Plant. Following a lengthy discussion on this matter, it was

agreed that the Senior Engineer would seek further clarification from Irish Water with regard

to the sewage capacity at the Ardagh Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Following discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Galvin, and seconded by Councillor

Scanlan that a Special Meeting be held to give further consideration to this matter.

This concluded the Meeting.

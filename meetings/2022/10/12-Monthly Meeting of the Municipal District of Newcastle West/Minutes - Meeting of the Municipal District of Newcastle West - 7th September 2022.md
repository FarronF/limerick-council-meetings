Under the National Broadband Plan, high-speed broadband will be delivered to every

premises in Ireland through a combination of commercial and state investment. For Limerick,
---

the State have determined that 78% of premises are in the commercial (Blue) area, an area in

which commercial operators have indicated that they currently are or will shortly be providing

a broadband service in that area. The remaining 22%, which equates to 21,131 premises

including homes, farms, businesses and schools, are in the State Intervention

Area (Amber), an area in which commercial operators do not and have no plans to provide a

broadband service, and where the State has committed to ensuring access to

high-speed broadband for all citizens.

The company delivering on this commitment on behalf of the State is National Broadband

Ireland (NBI). The Boola, Broadford area of Limerick falls within the DA131

Meelin deployment area of the National Broadband Plan rollout. As of August 8th 2022, the

latest information available from NBI indicated that the surveys in this area were still pending,

and that the anticipated date for connection of properties in this area was somewhere

between January 2025 and December 2026. NBI also noted on this date that they were

“working with ComReg on trying to get access to a particular market product that could make

a difference to areas currently in the latter parts of the build programme”, but that it would

likely be 2023 before they know if that will come to fruition. Further information can be

sought by emailing reps@nbi.ie, a dedicated inbox setup by NBI for councillors to contact

directly for the latest information regarding their representation queries.

As an alternative while the main National Broadband Plan deployment is ongoing, Broadband

Connection Points are rural locations within the State Intervention Area where a free high-

speed (150Mbps) public broadband connection will be provided for both indoor and outdoor

use by the local community, in an effort to support remote working and promote connected

communities, and help communities to quickly access free public high-speed broadband in

advance of the main deployment under the National Broadband Plan. Under this Programme,

Limerick City and County Council has had 16 Broadband Connection Point locations approved

across the county, the nearest to Boola, Broadford being 15km away at the Glenmore

Community Centre (V42 YK77) in Strand, Co. Limerick, while The Old Schoolhouse (P56 K302)

in Co. Cork is 11km away in the other direction.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the original Part 8 planning for Garryduff Cross, Newcastle***

***West include public lighting? If it did when will it be installed. This is a very dangerous***

***junction.***

REPLY:

The condition regarding planning was that “Road lights shall be confined to the minimum that

are necessary for road safety. They shall be cowled in such manner as to minimise light spill

to the roadway”.

Recent discussions with Transport Infrastructure Ireland have indicated that this junction is

unlikely to be lit in accordance with their current standards. TII see this junction as having

being improved significantly from a safety point of view and is similar to junctions across the

national road network that are not lit. The improvements that were put in place making it a
---

It is proposed to replace the existing fence with 1.2 metre high playground fencing, remove

mulch under the zip line. The Council also intends to power wash all of the playground

equipment. This will provide a much needed upgrade in the short term. These works will be

completed by the end of September 2022.

Once this upgrade has been completed, the Council will review to see if further improvements

can be made in terms of any additional equipment for the playground.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle requested that the playground in Newcastle West

be upgraded and in replying, the Director stated that money has been allocated to the

dog park. The funding required is expected to be in the order of €15,000 - €20,000.

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that*** ***Council owned lands be provided for allocation as***

***allotments in this Municipal area in the interest of sustainability.*

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY:

The Council will consider Council owned lands for allotments. However, there are a number

of issues to be considered before a decision can be made on allocating lands for allotments,

for example, management and maintenance, administration and the cost of water and waste

collection.

The matter will need to be reviewed, and if necessary, a policy document on Council provided

allotments may be developed. The policy should set out and provide clarity on the various

roles and responsibilities in relation to allotments.

This would provide direction to the Council on how we can assist communities by providing

allotments in their locality.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that lands be provided for allocation

as allotments and asked when the policy document would be made available. In replying, the

Director acknowledged the need for a policy document and agreed to liaise with the relevant

Directorate on this matter.

The following items were also raised.

The Members referred to the recently opened Knights of Glin Heritage Centre and

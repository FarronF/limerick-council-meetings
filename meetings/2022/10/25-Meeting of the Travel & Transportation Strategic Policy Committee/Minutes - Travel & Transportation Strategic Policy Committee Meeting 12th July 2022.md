**Item 3. LSMATS Update** **–** **Mr. Robert Gallagher, Senior Engineer**

Mr. Gallagher gave an update on LSMATS confirming that the NTA presented the second draft of

LSMATS at the April Travel and Transportation SPC meeting, at which the major changes were

outlined. He added that the draft was well received by Elected Members and the Public

Consultation closed on the 10th June. There were 83 submissions of which the main topics were

the following:

1. LNDR – There were some submissions agreeing with the removal of the LNDR from

LSMATS, however the vast majority of the submissions were opposed to its removal. This

is still under discussion with the NTA and stakeholders, and an update will follow in due

course.

2. Rail Transport – There was a warm welcome for inclusion of heavy rail infrastructure and

the proposed link to Shannon Airport. Faster implementation was recommended.

3. Entrance from Corbally – It was considered necessary for LSMATS to deal with this issue

in more detail.

4. Targets – It was deemed imperative that the targets be more challenging and realistic.

Mr. Gallagher concluded that detailed consideration of the submissions is now underway by the

NTA and a final draft is expected in September/October 2022.

The Chair indicated a special meeting could be organised to discuss updates and progress if

required. Cllr. Mitchell thanked Mr. Gallagher for the update and added that the proposed LNDR

is vital infrastructure. He asked if the LNDR is now omitted permanently. Mr. Gallagher advised

that it is not definitive and the Executive will be actively striving to have it included in the final

draft.

Mr. Sean Mc Glynn updated the members on a recent visit to Dun Laoghaire where ideas were

shared regarding Active Travel.

Cllr. Secas congratulated Cllr. Novak Uí Chonchúir on her position as Chair and thanked the

previous Chair, Cllr. Leddin. She thanked the presenters for the very informative presentations.

She pointed out that community engagement is crucial and should be included from the

beginning. She added that there are genuine concerns regarding the route on the UL to Annacotty

scheme. Some residents have made proposals to the Council and she urged the Council to take

these on board.

Mr. Harper congratulated Cllr. Novak Uí Chonchúir on her position as Chair and congratulated

the Active Travel Team. He noted there is ample funding and staff are now in place. He expressed

his concerns regarding delivery and tracking of the schemes and noted the LIT/TUS and MIC

routes to the city were announced in 2015 and a spade has not been put in the ground yet. He

would like to see a dashboard showing the expected start date and duration of a project, the

spend to date and any delay explained.

Cllr. Collopy commented that the presentation was very informative and asked if the content

could be emailed to the members. Mr. McGlynn welcomed Cllr. Collopy and confirmed that the

presentations would be circulated to the members.

In response to Cllr. Secas, Mr. Mc Glynn agreed that community engagement is important. In

response to Mr. Harper, Mr. Brennan advised that there are six weekly updates to elected

members and briefing sessions are also held. Mr. McGlynn also stated that there is a project

management tool in operation and a report can be generated for all projects and an update given

through the SPC.

Cllr. O’ Donovan asked if there was a start date for the project at Baggot Estate. Referencing Mr.

Harper’s point regarding TUS to City Centre, Cllr. O’Donovan asked why is it still at options stage.

She would like to see scrutiny of this and feels communication is a very important part of Active

Travel. From submissions coming through, the same observations seem to be coming up all the

time e.g. access for emergency vehicles and removal of trees. She asked if we could do a Myth

busting communication around misinformation.

Cllr. Sheahan’s (M) advised that his main concern was the route from Castletroy to Annacotty

and in particular Mulcair Drive. He was glad to hear there would be community engagement.

Cllr. Mc Sweeney congratulated Cllr. Novak Uí Chonchúir on her election as Chair and welcomed

the discussion on the Active Travel schemes. He expressed his disappointment that the Active

Travel team had previously refused to engage with communities prior to Part 8. He would like to

see a commitment from Active Travel that in the event of any Part 8 impacting residents, there

will be prior consultation in the form of pop up clinics to engage with residents.---

In reply to Cllr. O’ Donovan, Mr. McGlynn advised that a Brief is being worked on for consultants

to review Emergency Services Access across Active Travel Projects. It was also agreed that the

Active Travel Team would put together the AT approach of best possible results to each project

in terms of Trees and Development. As regards the Castletroy to Annacotty project, engagement

is already in place.

In response to a question regarding the S.C.R. scheme, Ms. Flanagan acknowledged the delay

however, added that the scheme has expanded to Ballykeeffe, which required a detailed options

report to be completed. She expects a Part 8 to be lodged before the end of the year with a

tender for construction early next year. The Active Travel Unit is happy to tweak communications

and Ms. Flanagan is working on a report regarding removal of trees and emergency access.

In reply to Cllr. Mc Sweeney, Mr. Mc Glynn committed that Active Travel will communicate and

engage with stakeholders. He also agreed to a review and issue a briefing of the costing to date

for the S.C.R. scheme, as this has expanded to a much bigger scheme.

Cllr. Teefy expressed her thanks for the presentation and acknowledged the good work but

wished to remind all present that there is also a big county out there. She was particularly

interested in what role a mini sweeper could have in a smaller town. In response, Mr. McGlynn

agreed that much of the work has been done in the Metropolitan area but there is a parcel of

works to be done in the county areas and he intends to progress this.

Mr. Harper stated that following the last SPC meeting at which the NTA presented on LSMATS,

he asked why we need approval from NTA. He also referenced a recent video where the NTA said

they had some concerns in relation to some designs. In response, Mr. McGlynn stated that

transparency in dealing with NTA is very important and Active Travel conforms to the gateways

set out by the NTA. Mr. Gallagher further added that cycling guidelines are changing; scenarios

are changing so designs need to change accordingly. Mr. Gallagher stated that the designs from

the Active Travel office are of a very high quality.

The Chair thanked the Active Travel presenters and added it was good to see an enlarged Active

Travel team. However, she shared the concerns for the MIC and LIT/TUS to City Centre and hoped

it would be completed before another name change.

Cllr. Teefy wished to express her disappointment at the new layout of the Roxboro Road/Childers

Road. The road has very much narrowed and in her opinion the cycle lanes are not being greatly

utilised. The Chair advised that this would be a matter for discussion at an operational level.

She advised that the next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, the 25th October 2022.

The meeting then concluded.---

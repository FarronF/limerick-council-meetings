3. Correspondence

Correspondence received from Minister Peter Burke’s Office, following correspondence sent

by the Municipal District in March in respect of the role of the Directly Elected Mayoral

position in Limerick, was read into the minutes. The Elected Members held a frank

discussion on the response, and agreed to correspond with Minister Peter Burke’s Office

requesting further clarification regarding---
 Details of the role of the Directly Elected Mayor

 Whether a Citizens Assembly will be made available in Limerick as has been in the

Dublin Region.

 In relation to a second attempt at passing a budget, please advise if the required

number of Elected Members to do so is 15 out of 40, and if so, please note that the

Elected members of Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District are not in favour of

such a low requirement to pass a budget.

 A timeframe for election of the Directly Elected Mayor. We acknowledge that this is

dependent on the passing of legislation and a role for Government. The Elected

Members of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District believe that the most

appropriate timeframe for an election of a Directly Elected Mayor would be to

coincide with the 2024 Local Elections.

A draft of the correspondence will be circulated to all Elected Members before it is to be

submitted.

The Elected Members would like to acknowledge the reply received and note that the

reply is also appreciated.

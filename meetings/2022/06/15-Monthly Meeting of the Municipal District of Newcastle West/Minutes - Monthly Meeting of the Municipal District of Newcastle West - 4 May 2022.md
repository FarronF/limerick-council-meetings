NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

7

***to get tenants housed as soon as possible.***

Once the Allocations Team are aware a property is ready for allocation, the

adopted by the Elected Members of Limerick City and County Council.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to vacant houses in the District and to

national legislation in place which requires houses to reach a certain standard before being

occupied.

The Members expressed dissatisfaction at the reply received and following discussion, it was

proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Galvin and agreed by all the

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council explore avenues to assist Voluntary Housing***

***organisations in acquiring properties. At present there are too many regulatory steps for***

***the VHB’s to complete before they can bid on properties and the properties are then being***

***sold on the private market.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

Under 'Housing for All', the Government's priority is to deliver 47,600 new build social homes

over the next five years. Given the focus of support on the build programme and the need to

avoid competition, Limerick City and County Council has been requested to limit acquisitions---
8

of privately owned properties to specific priority acquisitions (homeless and disability),

including in circumstances where a valid notice to quit has issued to sitting tenants. The

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have requested a focus on the

following priority areas:

- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;

- Other properties that allow persons/families to move from homelessness;

- Specific housing required for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.

Any acquisition proposed must represent value for money under the Department’s

acquisitions guidelines.

Limited acquisitions by Approved Housing Bodies through the Capital Assistance Scheme

(CAS) will also continue where they are focussed on specific vulnerable cohorts, such as

housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and

for people with disability. However, the priority remains to focus to the greatest extent

possible on the Approved Housing Bodies sector increasing new-build construction delivery

under the Capital Assistance Scheme.

Limerick City and County Council are required under Circular 11/2018 to undertake a number

of due-diligence checks for proposed Local Authority direct and Approved Housing Bodies

acquisitions.

These checks would include - but are not limited to - ensuring the all-in cost (acquisition plus

refurbishment) is within the Department's costs guidelines, confirming there is a demand.

For a unit from our Allocation's team, ensuring no-overconcentration of social housing in the

immediate neighbourhood in addition to ensuring that we are not competing with first-time

buyers.

If any Approved Housing Body wishes to discuss any of the funding streams available and the

sequence of steps involved as required by the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Heritage, we are happy to arrange a meeting to discuss.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle expressed his dissatisfaction at the response

received and it was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would liaise with the relevant

Directorate on this matter.

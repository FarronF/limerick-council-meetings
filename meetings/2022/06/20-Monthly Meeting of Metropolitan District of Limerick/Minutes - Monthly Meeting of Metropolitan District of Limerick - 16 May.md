1.

The Members thanked the Senior Planner for her presentation and referred to the scale of the

proposed development and, following consideration and discussion of the details of the proposed

development, the Members made the following points, summarised as follows:

 An Bord Pleanála should consider the adequacy of the existing infrastructure in the area and

the impact that this proposed development would have;

 Significant congestion issues already exist in relation to the Pa Healy Road and at the Dublin

Road traffic lights, i.e. people living in Rhebogue have significant difficulty getting out onto

Dublin road. The Members agreed that a comprehensive Traffic Management Plan was required

for the entire area;

 The area needs appropriate public transport and active travel provisions to be put in place;

 The impact that not completing the Northern Distributor Road proposals may have on this area;

 Concerns were raised in relation to discharge of water to the canal during construction and the

importance that any discharges should be carefully managed;

 Concern raised that the Park Canal walkway could be blocked to facilitate construction and how

this would be managed;

 The Members referred to the number of build to rent apartments and agreed that the

composition should be changed and the number of build to rent apartments reduced if

possible.

**(b)Strategic Housing Development (SHD) Application to An Bord Pleanála at Ballykeefe, Raheen,**

**Limerick**

The Senior Planner gave a presentation to the Members on the proposed Strategic Housing

application.

She explained that the proposed development included:



182 apartment and duplex units across 25 small-scale blocks, 2 to 4 storeys in heights,

throughout the development. The apartments and duplexes provide a mix of one, two, three

and four bed units, comprising of 10 no. four bedroom duplex units, 10 no. three bedroom

(approximately 29,500m2, or 28.2% of the total site area), landscaping, lighting, internal

roads, cycle paths, and footpaths.

The Members thanked the Senior Planner for her presentation and, following consideration and

discussion of the details of the proposed development, the Members made the following points,

summarised as follows:

-

No objection in principle to the delivery of housing but agreed that the open space provision

should be increased to include the area of land to the north of the site, zoned open space in

the LAP and within the landowner’s ownership;

-

The Members referred to the site history, and the open space zoning to the north of the site

was outlined where, in 2004, the Members of Limerick County Council approved a variation to

the Southern Environs District Development Plan 1999 in relation to the re-zoning of land at

Gouldavoher. The proposal had involved the rezoning of approximately 10 acres of land

designated for the provision of a Neighbourhood Park from open space use to residential use.

The rezoning was carried out on the understanding that the developer would donate the

remaining lands zoned for the Neighbourhood Park to Limerick County Council. However, the

Members noted that the lands in question, which were the subject of rezoning, were never

transferred/developed. The Members agreed that there is still a significant need for additional

public amenity space in the Raheen/Dooradoyle area. In the context of the site history, the

Members agreed that the area of land to the north of the site, zoned open space in the LAP and

within the landowner’s ownership, should be developed as open space as part of the

development;

-

Additional residential amenity areas should be provided within the development footprint;

-

The Members queried the pedestrian access through Ballinvoher Estate and the need for it.

They were of the view that the creation of this access would lead to a negative impact on

established residents in the Ballinvoher, Inis Mór, Inis Lua & Thornberry Lane and they

recommended that this connection should be omitted from development. Members also

agreed that consideration must be given to the quality of life of the existing residents in the

adjoining estates in this regard;

-

Members also agreed that a 10 year permission period should not be permitted in the interest

of protecting the amenity of neighbouring properties from ongoing lengthy works/disruption;

-

Footpath connectivity through Inis Mór estate is unacceptable and a footpath should be

provided on the outside of treeline on R510;

-

Query raised over public services on site with regard to foul and storm water disposal;

-

Dormer bungalow allocation should run the entire length of the southern boundary in order to

reduce the impact on the existing adjoining residential areas;

-

A condition should be attached so that development is not purchase by a private fund and units

are available to individual buyers;

-

Special contribution to be levied for the provision of cycle and footpaths on the R510;

-

Boundary treatment should ensure site security.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council has any plans***

***to review rents for Council tenants to help cope with the increased cost of living.***

**REPLY**: There are no such proposals planned. There is a very marked difference between the

Council’s Differential Rents Scheme and rents payable in the private sector, in that the

former is based on household income and the latter is dictated by market forces. The rent

of Council tenants may therefore vary, either up or down, in accordance with the income of

household members at any particular point in time, which provides a level of security not

enjoyed by those renting privately. The average weekly Council rent at the moment stands

at €62.25.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the taking***

***in charge of the Meadows and Troys Lock Estates in Lower Park.***

**REPLY**: Troy’s Lock and The Meadows are both on the list of estates for Taking in Charge. Reports

have been prepared to quantify the works required to bring the estates to a Taking in Charge

standard. These reports are currently under review, with a view to having the estates

brought to a taking-in-charge standard as soon as is practical, subject to funding allocation.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a detailed breakdown***

water sport enthusiasts throughout the May bank holiday weekend each year.

The annual festival is a celebration of the city’s position on the tidal River Shannon and its

designation as a Gateway City to the Wild Atlantic Way, echoed in our brand positioning

Limerick Atlantic Edge, European Embrace.

Riverfest Limerick is an opportunity to showcase the city’s energy, excitement, grit and

limitless possibilities from its Atlantic location, while acting as a stage for street artists, live

music and cultural events throughout the May bank holiday weekend.

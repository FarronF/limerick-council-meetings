Votes of Sympathy

At the outset and with the permission of the Mayor, the Council extended its sympathy to Cllr Bridie

Collins on the recent passing of her father in law.

A minute’s silence was observed as a mark of respect.

The Mayor explained that he had called the Special Meeting following a request from some

Members in order to discuss the following:

That, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the global grain shortage, the Government

should, as a matter of urgency, establish an Expert National Review Group on Horticulture to

include the main stakeholders and to report back in six months. The purpose of the Group

would be to review the industry under the headings:

Food Security; Import Substitution; Employment Opportunities.

Areas to include – Protected Crops,

Fruit Production – Top Fruits (apples)

Soft Fruits and the Seed Potato Sector.---

The Members referred to the ongoing crisis in the Ukraine, condemned the invasion of

Ukraine by Russia, and called for an end to this war. They noted that one of the many impacts

of this invasion was the effect it was having on the supply of grain and the impact that this

was having on the farming sector with the cost of production such as fertilizer and feedstuffs

being also affected as a result.

This was creating a big issue for farmers and, combined with the increase in fuel costs also in

recent months, was affecting this sector in a major way. The cost of feeding livestock,

especially during the coming winter, was also of huge concern for farmers.

Members agreed that it was therefore very important that an Expert National Review Group

on Horticulture be established which would include the main stakeholders in this area and

which would report back in six months. The purpose of the Group would be to review the

industry under various headings including Food Security; Import Substitution and

Employment Opportunities with areas also to include Protected Crops, Fruit Production and

Soft Fruits and the Seed Potato Sector.

Members agreed that increased costs in the farming sector would lead to an impact on the

price of foodstuffs in the daily shopping basket of all consumers and stressed the importance

in reducing food waste as much as possible and the need for food companies to be more

innovative where possible to address these challenges.

Members also agreed that Ireland needs to be more self-sufficient in growing as many crops

as possible, rather than importing many food items from outside Ireland. This would help

address any potential shortfalls and they agreed the importance of incentivising farmers to

produce more agricultural products and for supermarkets to pay decent rates to farmers to

allow this to happen.

Proposed by Councillor Galvin,

Seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J);

And Resolved:

“That, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the global grain shortage, that the

Minister for Agriculture should, as a matter of urgency, establish an Expert National Review

Group on Horticulture to include the main stakeholders and to report back in six months. The

purpose of the Group would be to review all food industries under the headings:

Food Security; Import Substitution; Employment Opportunities. Areas to include – Protected

Crops, Fruit Production – Top Fruits (apples), Soft Fruits and the Seed Potato Sector. This

Motion to be circulated to all local authorities”

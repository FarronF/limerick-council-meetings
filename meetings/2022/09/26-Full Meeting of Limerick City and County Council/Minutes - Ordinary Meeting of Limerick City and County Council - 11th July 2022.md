Housing

Affordable Housing

Further to the Special Meeting of the Council held on 23rd June, 2022 the Director of Services,

Housing gave a PowerPoint presentation to the Members on affordable housing provisions

contained in the Housing Delivery Action Plan.

She outlined how the Action Plan also sets a target of 1156 units for affordable housing

over the next 5 years from 2022 to 2026, under various schemes including Local Authority

Build affordable purchase; Local Authority Turnkey Affordable purchase; AHB Cost Rental; and

LDA Affordable Purchase & Cost Rental.

The Members thanked the Director for her presentation and stressed the importance of

delivery of these targets in the specified timeframe due to the current housing crisis that

was impacting on so many people. They also agreed that following the recent adoption of

the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028, that housing measures contained within this

plan also needed to be achieved.

They also proposed that the Land Development Agency (LDA) should be invited to give a

presentation to the Members on progress to date on the Colbert Quarter Scheme and also

on proposed locations such as the Guinness Site as Members felt that these proposed

developments were taking too much time to be progressed. Members were also unhappy

with the delays being experienced with An Bord Pleanála in making decisions on housing

developments and agreed that this was also a factor adding to delays.

The Chief Executive confirmed that a Working Group had been established between

Limerick City and County Council and the Land Development Agency. This was being co-

chaired between both himself and John Coleman in the LDA in order to progress

developments quicker and he confirmed that the LDA would be invited to present to the

Members at the September Meeting.

Circulated, report by Members who had participated at Conference / Seminar /

The report was noted by the Members.

QUESTION

The reply to the following Question on the agenda was circulated to all Members prior

to the Meeting and the Question was therefore taken as having been dealt with:

9.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

**I will ask at the next Meeting if there are any plans to recruit more staff for the Rent Section of the**

**Council as there are backlogs with rent assessments resulting in people whose circumstances have**

**changed being hit with huge arrears in rent up to six months or more in some cases.**

**REPLY:**

The approved staff complement in the Rents Unit is adequate to deal with the

workload arising. Similar to any other business unit within the Council, the

pandemic has interfered to some extent with the normal workflow on an

intermittent basis over the past two years.

Under the terms of the standard Letting Agreement signed by tenants, it is

their responsibility in the first instance to advise the Council of any variations

in income within the household, either up or down, so that their rent can be

adjusted accordingly. This is clearly explained to them at pre-tenancy induction

training. Some tenants appear reluctant to do this, particularly when there can

be an upward revision to the rent accruing. In such situations, it may well be

many months, or even longer, before the Council becomes aware of such a

change in circumstances and, furthermore, there can be further delays caused

by incomplete or inadequate documentary proof being submitted. This can

lead in some cases to significant arrears having to be ultimately applied to the

account. Individual tenants, or members on their behalf, should contact the

rent account manager for their area with any concerns.

**Suspension of Standing Orders:** It was noted that the time was approaching 5.30 p.m. and

on the proposal of Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), Standing Orders

NOTICES OF MOTION

With the permission of the Mayor, it was agreed to take Notice of Motion No. 13 at

this time:

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Collins

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister**

**for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys, TD, and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts,**

**Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin, TD, to find a solution which would allow**

**artists with disabilities to be in receipt of the Basic Income for Artists payment without it**

**affecting their disability supports and request the introduction of a Pilot Scheme for artists**

**with disabilities, to co-exist for the duration for the Basic Income for Artists Pilot Scheme**

**which would remove the weekly earnings limit and means test from those in receipt of**

**disability supports.**

On the proposal of Councillor Collins (B), seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon, the Motion

was adopted by the Council.

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale –

Councillors A. Teskey (Proposer), B. Collins, S. Keary, E. O’Brien, J.

O’Donoghue, K. Sheahan

**We will move at the next Meeting that the current bi-monthly meetings of the Full Council**

**would revert to blended hybrid monthly meetings.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor Keary.

REPLY:

**Background:**

A similar Motion was also moved by Councillor Keary in 2016 and 2020. On

both occasions, it was agreed that Meetings of the Full Council would continue

to meet bi-monthly but that the SPC meetings would be held in intervening

months to allow detailed discussion on any policy issues before they are

referred to Full Council for approval.

**Matters to be considered in regard to the Motion:**

**Existing Number of Meetings Annually**

Based on the table below, every Councillor in his/her respective membership

of the Full Council/Municipal or Metropolitan District/two SPCs currently

attends **30 meetings** per year from those meetings alone as follows:
---
13

 Plenary Council Bi-Monthly, Annual and Budget Meetings

8

 Metropolitan / Municipal District Monthly and Annual Meetings 12

 SPC Meetings 10

In addition, Councillors attend Joint Policing Committee meetings, Local

Community Development Committee meetings, various other sub-committee

meetings as well as briefings and workshops.

**Role of Municipal/Metropolitan District Councils**

Municipal Districts now have an enhanced policy provision remit since 2014.

Members can move Motions and Questions relevant to their District at their

respective monthly meetings. It should also be noted that Standing Orders for

Full Council provide that “Motions which relate to the business of the

Metropolitan/Municipal District may only be submitted to the relevant

District.”

Therefore, only matters of wider strategic application are generally decided at

Plenary level and the Municipal Districts should continue to perform a range

of functions relevant to their own District at their statutory monthly meetings.

**Special Meetings of Full Council**

An option available under existing Standing Orders is to hold Special Meetings

to deal with Full Council business or any issues that may arise in the period

between Council Meetings. In 2021, each Elected Member would have

attended9 Special Meetings of the Full Council. The Municipal Districts would

also have held a number of Special Meetings.

**Additional Resource Requirement:**

The additional cost of Monthly Full Council Meetings requires consideration in

light of tightening budgets. The additional draw on staff to administer

additional Full Council Meetings and the associated additional SPC Meetings

must also be considered.

**Current Arrangements:**

With the revised SPC arrangements now in place for over four years, it has

been found that the five (5) SPC Chairperson’s reports are consistently

provided as agenda items of each bi-monthly Full Council Meeting and policies

agreed at SPC are considered for approval at Full Council Meetings.

Any change to Monthly Meetings would require a realignment of all meetings

to synchronise with this change, including the current integrated series of

Council Meetings / SPC Meetings to deal with policy matters of the Council. A
---
14

change to Monthly Full Council Meetings would require SPCs to change to

monthly meetings also. It would also require a review of the current

arrangements pertaining to issues dealt with each month at District Level.

The current system has worked effectively since the changes adopted in July

2016. The addition of a further five Ordinary Full Council Meetings and, by

extension, five additional monthly SPC meetings, would further add to

pressures on Elected Members on top of the existing large workload.

Having regard to the matters outlined above, it is proposed that Full Council

Meetings would continue to be held on a bi-monthly basis in January, March,

May, July, September and November, in addition to the Annual Meeting,

Budget Meetings and Special Meetings as required.

The Members discussed the response to the Notice of Motion and differing views were

expressed. The Chief Executive outlined that the executive works closely with the Members

and indicated that there would be a concern if Plenary Meetings were adjourned, however

that was not the case. The Members raised some concerns in relation to Municipal District

Meetings. The Executive agreed to meet and conduct a review of the standing orders of

Municipal District Meetings to consider streamlining delegated powers and report back to the

Members in November.

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Newcastle West –

Councillors L. Galvin (Proposer), F. Foley, J. Scanlan, J. Sheahan, T. Ruddle

**We will move at the next Meeting that responsibility for the maintenance and allocation of**

**Council-owned property in the Newcastle West Municipal District is returned to the**

**Municipal District with adequate staff to manage same.**

**Maintenance of Stock**

The maintenance of the social housing stock is arranged on an area basis being

Metropolitan, Newcastle West, Adare-Rathkeale and Cappamore-Kilmallock.

Stock within the Municipal District of Newcastle West is maintained through

the Housing Maintenance Team in the District.

Each area has a direct labour team and uses contractors as required for

particular services (plumbing, electrical etc.) This mix allows flexibility which

can respond as required to the fluctuating level of maintenance requests.

Requests for maintenance are received through Customer Services, cases are

created and logged and entered onto the Sugar CRM system. They are then

allocated to the relevant area and team for action (Housing Maintenance).

The maintenance budget for the District is broadly similar year-on-year and is

balanced to the level of demand that is presented in the area and the number

of units as a percentage of the overall housing stock.

The staffing and resource availability is adequate to the level of demand being

experienced in the District.

**(b)**

**Pre-lets/Voids**

Though not referenced in the Notice of Motion, pre-lets and voids are also

returned through the District Office.

Some larger-scale returns are completed by Housing Construction once the

scope of work has been established and if that is a more efficient method of

return.

Again, use is made of the direct labour teams and contractors, depending upon

the nature of works and volume of works on hand at any particular time. This

blend is the most effective method for returns as it can make best use of the

particular advantages of both approaches. Using contractors allows additional

resources to be mobilised as required, while direct labour teams are very

flexible and can respond at short notice as may be required.

The outline procedure is that on the return of the dwelling, it is firstly inspected

to determine the level of works required. A cost estimate is then prepared and

the dwelling is issued to the area for return works to be undertaken. A budget

is also allocated for completion of the works. Using either direct labour or

contractors is an operational decision based upon the workload at the time

and the nature and extent of works required.

As at 6th July, there are fifteen units in the process of being returned by

Newcastle West Housing Maintenance Team. Of these, five are currently on-

site and works are progressing, one is in the procurement/design phase and

nine have been returned and are to be inspected.

**(c)**

**Allocation of Houses**
---
16

The allocation of houses is an Executive Function carried out in accordance

with the Council’s Housing Allocation Scheme. This function is done on a

centralised basis to ensure appropriate expertise is available and has proven

to be the most effective and efficient.

**Conclusion**

The maintenance of Council housing is carried out on a District basis, while the

allocation of houses is carried out on a centralised basis. It is not

recommended to change this operational method.

The Chief Executive confirmed he has full confidence in the Director and the team who are

operating in the midst of a housing crisis.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Newcastle West –

Councillors J. Sheahan (Proposer), F. Foley, L. Galvin, J. Scanlan and T.

Ruddle

**We will move at the next Meeting that where Irish Water apply for a road opening licence**

**to Limerick City and County Council, they should be asked to pay a bond that will cover the**

**cost of full reinstatement of the road within a short period of time to be determined.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor

Galvin.

**Reply:**

Limerick City and County Council does indeed seek bonds from Irish Water

contractors, depending on the application and location.

However, it is accepted that for some road openings (e.g. emergencies),

appropriate and prompt reinstatement is not being addressed and a road

opening licence needs to be in place immediately in line with agreed protocols

for such openings.

Where the Council is satisfied that a utility such as Irish Water does not manage

such an opening properly and where such works are not capable of being

managed under the online Road Opening system, all options and measures

need to be considered to ensure the public road is protected.

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council seek to increase the Operation and**

**Maintenance budget for Cemeteries in the amount of €100,000 per annum, to provide for**

**adequate repairs and maintenance on Ancient and Historic structures in Burial Grounds, in**

**accordance with the adopted Burial Ground Strategy.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor E. Ryan and seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

**REPLY:**

The Council adopted a Burial Ground Strategy at its Meeting of May 2021. For

the first time, the Strategy attempted to qualify and quantify the masonry

heritage assets that are extant in the Local Authority’s graveyards through a

preliminary survey. The Strategy recommended that a programme of

detailed condition surveying, vegetation control and consolidation needs

to be established. This will require a significant stream of funding for a

period of years. Larger projects may be multi-annual, but there could be

capacity to bundle smaller projects and address them within one financial

year.

The 2022 budget allocation for Heritage Assets within Burial Grounds in 2022

is €15,000. At present, from the preliminary survey, there are nine structures

in need of urgent attention to arrest their decline in order that they do not

become a health and safety hazard, with a further 27 classed as fairly urgent.

The Community Monuments Fund was established by the National

Monuments Service, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage,

in 2020 and it has provided funding towards works in Clonshire in 2020 and

2021 and towards works in Kilfinane and Ballynoe (Bruree) in 2022. To take

maximum advantage from this funding stream, however, the Local Authority

needs to provide match funding that would see a programme of works that

would deal with the most urgent issues more rapidly.

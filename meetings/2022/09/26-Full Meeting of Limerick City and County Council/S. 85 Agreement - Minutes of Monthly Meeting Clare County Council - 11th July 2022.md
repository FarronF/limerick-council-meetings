and experience. Mr. O’Sullivan informed the members that there is currently a

input they may have in relation to potential opportunities for the Shannon Estuary.

opportunities that should be optimized.

Mr. O’Sullivan stated that the Taskforce will scope potential areas of opportunity for

the Shannon Estuary and specify policy and investment requirements to exploit those

areas of potential. Mr. O’Sullivan referred to the areas that can be focused on over

the next 5, 10, 15 or 20 years in order to create employment and felt that there is a

need to take advantage of the move to renewable energy. Mr. O’Sullivan informed

the members that initially the Taskforce are looking for 4-5 tasks that can be

supported and accelerated locally and nationally.

Mr. O’Sullivan referred to the scope of work and provided details of the four key

areas identified as offshore energy; onshore energy; transport and logistics and

tourism.

Mr. O’Sullivan outlined the composition of the core Taskforce and welcomed Pat

8---
Pat Dowling, Chief Executive thanked Mr. O’Sullivan and Mr. Rattigan for the

presentation and noted that the Strategic Integrated Framework Plan was shared with

the members of the Taskforce previously. Mr. Dowling stated that the Shannon

Estuary is a unique location which has yet to deliver tangible economic projects. Mr.

Dowling stated that it is significant that the Government has set up the Economic

Taskforce and that it has now been agreed to include local authorities. Mr. Dowling

stated that he represents the Chief Executives from Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and

Kerry and that the role will alternate with the Chief Executives. Mr. Dowling noted

that a significant number of management team will participate in sub-groups. Mr.

Dowling acknowledged that Mr. O’Sullivan is very committed to the area and is

committed to jobs in the area. Mr. Dowling referred to the quick turnaround for

submissions and felt it is important to focus on a few deliverables as tangible

deliverables are needed. Mr. Dowling expressed confidence that the report will

deliver a positive outcome.

The elected members thanked Mr. O’Sullivan for his presentation and wished the

Taskforce well going forward. The elected members felt that the LNDR is crucial to

economic development in the region and that a rail link to Shannon airport is

important for sustainable transport. It was also requested that the Fergus Estuary be

examined. The elected members requested that positive discrimination be exercised

for County Clare in relation to wind energy and welcomed future development in

Clare. The members also felt that smaller areas in proximity to the Shannon Estuary

should benefit economically and that local networks should be included. The

members agreed that training for future job creation is key as the skilled personnel are

available in County Clare. The members also agreed that the potential of

Moneypoint should be maximized and that a trans-shipment area should be developed

on the Shannon Estuary. The members referred to the Maritime Centre in Kilrush and

felt that it is best placed to attract industry for Clare. The members felt that

environmental protection is key and that it is essential that tourism is to the fore with

the Taskforce. The members emphasized the need to ensure that objectives are

delivered.

communities.

**Item 16.**

**Tenancy management.**

Ar moladh Cllr. J. Flynn

Cuidithe ag Cllrs. C. Colleran Molloy agus P. Daly agus glacadh leis

“In the interest of public safety that Clare County Council elected members

1) call on Clare County Council, in support of the good estate management work

currently being done by the Council’s Tenancy Enforcement Officers to set up a multi

agency emergency response team to quickly & effectively deal with, and if necessary

to evict the small number of tenants across County Clare whose persistent serious

anti-social behaviour comes under the terms of the adopted Clare County Council

Behaviour Strategy 2020-2026 \* in order to

- protect adjoining residents & community

- Prevent damage to badly needed housing stock.

and also we

2) call on the appropriate State Agencies with related responsibilities to consider the

care and protection of underage children in such households

11---
\* This strategy was adopted in 2021 to prevent and reduce anti-social behaviour in the

3,000 plus tenancies in areas across Clare where the Council has Tenancy Dwellings

and Chapter 4 Tenancy Dwellings (RAS & Social Leasing)”

**Anne Haugh, Director of Social Development replied as follows:**

“The framework to address non-compliance with Tenancy Agreements is a judicial

process which must be followed to secure an eviction or repossession of a Council

property. There is no mechanism under law for a multi-agency team to take on this role.

The Council work closely with state agencies in dealing with complaints of anti-social

behaviour and have a robust process for onward referral of complaints.

The Council has a duty to manage and control dwellings let under the Housing Acts,

with a view to securing and protecting the interests of tenants and their families in the

peaceful occupation of their homes. In accordance with our Anti-Social Behaviour

Strategy, adopted by the Council last year, Clare County Council is committed to the

preservation of the peaceful occupation of all dwellings for which it is responsible and

will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.

Our Tenancy Enforcement team will investigate all complaints of anti-social behaviour

in an efficient, fair and impartial manner and will take all appropriate steps, in

accordance with best practice as set out in our ASB strategy, to prevent anti-social

behaviour. Clare County Council will carry out such investigations and inquiries as it

considers necessary to establish whether there is substantive evidence to suggest that

the respondent is or has engaged in anti-social behaviour. Upon investigating any such

complaints of alleged anti-social behaviour and having the necessary evidence to

support such breach the Council can decide on an appropriate remedy in accordance

with the Anti-Social Behaviour Strategy ranging from:

•

Advice

•

Verbal warning

•

Tenancy notification

•

Written warning.

•

Eviction.”

The elected members expressed disappointment that there is no mechanism under law

for a multi-agency team to be established to deal with tenants across County Clare

who persistently engage in serious anti-social behaviour. The members felt that

communities are in crisis and that this is unfair on residents in the estates affected.

The members noted that most of the Councils 3,000 tenancies are compliant and that

the Tenancy Enforcement Team are in place to support officials in the Council and to

deal with issues on a one-to-one basis. The members agreed that enhanced powers

are required to deal with the issues that are arising.

P. Dowling, Chief Executive stated that behaviour of people has to be managed in all

aspects of our work and that there is a process to go through and engage with other

agencies. Mr. Dowling stated that a key part of the Tenancy Enforcement Unit is to

develop relationships and engagement with tenants and that they will continue to deal

with situations that develop around the county.

**Item 17.**

**Upkeep of local authority housing estates.**

Ar moladh Cllr. C. Murphy

Cuidithe ag Cllrs. I. Lynch, S. Talty agus P. O’Gorman agus glacadh leis

“That a specific allocation be made in the 2023 budget to the Municipal District

offices with regards to a) road improvement works in, and b) general upkeep of, local

authority housing estates across the county.”

**Anne Haugh, Director of Social Development replied as follows:**

“As local authority estates are completed and taken into charge by the local authority it

has been custom and practice that these are maintained by the respective Municipal

District with the associated budgets incorporated into the various service divisions

within the annual budget. Maintenance of the properties themselves is a budget heading

centrally controlled within the Housing division.

While the roads within Local Authority estates have always traditionally been

acknowledged as part of the Municipal District roads network and maintained and

funded accordingly, the situation re maintenance of green areas within estates is more

ambiguous with different arrangements having evolved in various parts of the county

over the years. While some Local Authority estates are part of the annual grasscutting

contracts operated by the Shannon and Ennis Municipal Districts in particular, it is the

case that in many of the older estates maintenance of the green areas is undertaken

voluntarily by proactive residents associations and has not been an issue in the past.

As the number of new estates completed has grown in recent years and with a very

ambitious housing delivery programme underway, the issue of estate maintenance is

becoming more relevant of late and the Housing Section in recognition of the

importance of maintaining such significant and valuable assets has committed to

ensuring that all newly completed schemes under the Rebuilding Ireland and Housing

For All programmes will have a grass cutting regime in place for the summer season.

A modest additional allocation was provided in the 2022 Budget under Estate

Maintenance which allows for this to be undertaken, however it should be noted that

the costs are significant when considering this arrangement only covers nine out of a

total of 145 estates in the county. A further 63 estates are already included in existing

grass cutting contracts by the relevant Municipal Districts. The Housing Department

will continue to work with the Municipal Districts in addressing needs in some areas

where complaints or issues of local capacity may arise and there maybe potential to

extend existing contractual arrangements.

It is acknowledged that costs in the area of housing maintenance and estate

maintenance will continue to increase as the local authority stock expands

significantly over the coming years.”

The elected members stated that the condition of roads in several housing estates is

below standard and felt that this issue is falling between two directorates. The

members agreed that an annual maintenance programme with allocated funding is

required. The members appealed for funding to be allocated for the upkeep of these

estates.

P. Dowling, Chief Executive informed the members that this can be examined in the

context of the budget for 2023.

**Sustainable living options in rural towns and villages.**

Ar moladh Cllr. J. Garrihy

Cuidithe ag Cllr. S. Talty agus glacadh leis

“In the context of increasing or indeed prompting the development of much needed

housing in our Rural Towns and Villages I call on Clare County Council to engage

with all stakeholders to identify any and all options that can be pursued to deliver

sustainable living options that would both provide homes for those in need and bring

life back into these areas.”

**Leonard Cleary, Director of Rural Development and Anne Haugh, Director of**

**Social Development replied as follows:**

“Clare County Council’s approach to housing in rural towns and villages - both

planning and provision - is aligned to National Government Policy and Government

allocated resources. A comprehensive series of local Clare County Council strategies

and programmes of work deliver on this National programme. On a cross-Directorate

basis, the Planning, Housing, Municipal District Offices and Rural & Community

Departments are directly involved in leading aspects of this service area together with

other sections of Council. By necessity, this requires engagement with stakeholders in

the marketplace and community.

• The Government’s recently announced ‘Town Centre First Programme’, being led by

Planning Department, offers an opportunity to research and deliver housing projects in

rural towns and villages in new ways with a particular focus on vacant properties.

Government support is imminent in order to create staff capacity for such.

• The ongoing Government investment in social housing is a key factor in local

authority delivery in rural towns and villages.

• The rural housing aspect of the solutions to the Ukrainian refugees’ housing needs

offers a similar opportunity for Government investment and local provision.

Housing for All supports the re-generation of towns and villages as a means of

delivering sustainable housing solutions. To that end we await the publication of Croi

Conaithe for Towns to ascertain the exact nature of the supports which will be available

to address dereliction/vacancy in town centres as well as providing serviced sites for

development within or adjoining rural towns and villages.

In relation to the options for addressing vacancy to deliver social housing, the Vacant

Homes Officer is available to advise those with vacant properties on the relevant

schemes to support the return of the unit to productive use. A recent change to the

Repair and Leasing scheme has now opened up this option to owners of vacant

commercial properties also.”

The elected members acknowledged that the complexities of housing is a major

challenge that merits specific focus and engagement of key stakeholders. The members

felt that when choosing a rural location to live in, people need assurance regarding the

viability, sustainability and level of investment in the area.

**Shannon Heritage sites.**

Ar moladh Cllr. P. McMahon

Cuidithe ag Cllr. P.J. Ryan agus glacadh leis

“In view of Clare County Council involvement with the Shannon Heritage sites, I will

ask the Chief Executive to examine the opportunities and to ensure all the county

benefits from the tourism product.”

**Donnacha Lynch, Head of Commercial Services, Shannon Heritage Project**

**replied as follows:**

“Clare County Council continues to engage with the Government and Shannon Group

PLC as part of a detailed and robust due diligence process to consider the potential

transfer by Shannon Group PLC of Shannon Heritage (Clare-based sites) to Clare

County Council as a subsidiary company.

As part of the Due Diligence process Clare County Council has engaged experienced

specialist services to examine a range of topics including Human Resource, Operational

and Financial, Property and Assets, Capital Investment, ICT, Legal and Taxation

relating to the Shannon Heritage properties, namely Bunratty Castle & Folk Park,

Craggaunowen Bronze Age Park, Knappogue Castle & Gardens, and the retail unit

within Cliffs of Moher Experience. As a number of the Shannon Heritage Clare Sites

include a number of Heritage assets, Technical Due Diligence (TDD) reports are

required as part of the potential transfer of Shannon Heritage DAC to Clare County

Council as a subsidiary company.

The diligence process is nearing completion with a number of reports at final draft

stage, Clare County Council have met with the Department of Transport, who have

been engaging bilaterally with other Departments regarding the funding package

required in order for the transfer of Shannon Heritage DAC.

From a Clare County Council perspective, the transfer of Shannon Heritage DAC

cannot have a financial burden on Clare County Council's budgeting process, the

provision of statutory services or impact negatively on Clare’s Ratepayers.

As a result, and in order to move forward, a Nationally funded financial package will

be required. Clare County Council is not in a position to proceed with the transfer

without this National funding package. A decision is awaited.

Clare County Council and Shannon Group must agree on a schedule and transfer date

as the ambiguity surrounding Shannon Heritage ownership is having a negative

influence on operations and the morale of the 170 no. employees.

In anticipation of national government approval, Clare County Council have

commenced the recruitment process for number of permanent tourism roles, which will

be created in County Clare and will form part of a subsidiary company of Clare County

Council.

Clare County Council currently oversees the management, development, and

promotion of a portfolio of signature visitor attractions and sites throughout Clare,

including the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience, Loop Head Lighthouse, Vandeleur

Walled Gardens, the transfer of Shannon Heritage Clare sites and development of Inis

Cealtra Visitor Experience offers the opportunity for further balance of the extensive

Tourism portfolio of Clare County Council amongst the four Municipal Districts.

15---
In 2019 Clare County Council embarked on the development of an “*evidence based,*

*forward looking, innovative tourism strategy which would set the direction for tourism*

*product development, marketing / promotion and public and private investment over*

*the next ten years*”. This aligned also with the formation of a new Tourism Department

within the Rural Development Directorate. The core objective of the 10-year strategy,

known as the **Clare Tourism Strategy 2030 – Guiding our Journey to a Vibrant**

**New Future in Tourism** was to maximise the potential of tourism to deliver net

economic benefit to the communities across the county without negatively impacting

the natural, social, cultural, and environmental assets which provide the cornerstone of

the tourism product in Clare.

Regular communication and consultation with Shannon Heritage staff and Elected

Members is a key part of the ongoing process.”

The elected members suggested that new branding would enhance marketing of

Clare’s tourist attractions. The members felt that local people should benefit from

our tourist attractions. Referring to the upcoming KPMG Women’s Irish Open in

Dromoland the members felt that Shannon Airport and tourism within the county

should be promoted and that the area should be enhanced before this event begins.

The members welcomed the decision taken by Shamrock Rovers Football Club to use

Shannon Airport when travelling to their away games.

P. Dowling, Chief Executive informed the members that work is ongoing in securing

a decision and funding from Government in relation to the potential transfer by

Shannon Group PLC of Shannon Heritage and that meetings are scheduled with three

Government Departments. Referring to the upcoming KPMG Women’s Irish Open

Golf event in Dromoland, Mr. Dowling stated that Shannon Group will promote

Shannon Airport and that plans are in place to prepare for this event in order to grow

our tourism product.

“We call on Clare County Council to take all steps necessary, in continued

consultation with the communities of North Clare and other partners, to implement its

commitment to the development of a sustainable Host Community Pillar within the

Cliffs of Moher (2040) Strategy by:

1. Addressing legacy issues, particularly as they pertain to traffic management

and mobility planning that impact on the communities, Small Towns and

Villages of North Clare.

2. Undertake the development of the Cliffs of Moher site in conjunction with the

Burren & Cliffs of Moher UNESCO Global Geopark and other major tourism

attractions and activities so as to consolidate a diversified foundation for the

tourism industry and enhance the long term direct and indirect employment

and economic benefits of tourism in the local host community across the

county of Clare first and foremost.

16---
3. A continual mechanism of involvement in oversight in the implementation of

the Strategy for representatives nominated by the host community of

Ennistymon LEA.”

**Leonard Cleary, Director of Rural Development replied as follows:**

**“1. Addressing legacy issues, particularly as they pertain to traffic management**

**and mobility planning that impact on the communities, Small Towns and**

**Villages of North Clare.**

Elected Members recently visited the Cliffs of Moher site, received a presentation of

the vision for the Cliffs of Moher Strategy 2040 and participated in a discussion

workshop in the Council Chamber. As part of that discussion it was already agreed that

the Cliffs of Moher Strategy 2040 will include a ‘towns and villages pillar’ in the

Strategy. This refers to the hinterland of the Cliffs of Moher including mobility

solutions.

**2. Undertake the development of the Cliffs of Moher site in conjunction with the**

**Burren & Cliffs of Moher UNESCO Global Geopark and other major tourism**

**attractions and activities so as to consolidate a diversified foundation for the**

**tourism industry and enhance the long term direct and indirect employment and**

**economic benefits of tourism in the local host community across the county of**

**Clare first and foremost.**

The Cliffs of Moher operated under the strategic objectives of the Clare Tourism

Strategy 2030. This aims to integrate the efforts of all tourism products /attractions and

services across the county.

All of the existing economic benefits of the Cliffs of Moher Experience will be

significantly increased as the 2040 strategy is developed and implemented. It is

important to recognise that Cliffs of Moher Experience is currently a major economic

engine for County Clare including the towns, villages and the UNESCO Geopark,

underpinned by sustainable tourism practices. As a strategic national asset, the Cliffs

of Moher plays an important role in the County economy and the tourism industry being

one of the main attractors to Co. Clare. In 2019 the Cliffs of Moher Experience site

employed 170 people (around 45% full-time permanent positions). This included direct

employment of 75 staff (44 permanent and 31 seasonal) at an estimated total annual

employment cost of all employment €5million.

The local impact of this employment is highly significant – it is estimated that 90% of

staff live within 20 miles of the Cliffs, playing a significant role in sustaining local

spend, livelihoods and communities in a rural area that depends on tourism and

agriculture predominantly. Cliffs of Moher Experience spend on food, drink, art, craft

design, operational and maintenance services that have a significant impact in

supporting the local economy – 70% of this other expenditure is spent with local

businesses. There are over 40 Co. Clare Craft and Design suppliers and 15 Clare food

suppliers at Cliffs of Moher, most of which have emerged or grown over the last 15

years since the site was last developed.

In 2019 the Cliffs of Moher Experience site generated an estimated overall income of

€18m from visitor spend in the local economy. The site is committed to year round 363

days per annum with extended opening hours maximising opportunity direct and

indirect benefits and drawing attention to the West of Ireland being open for business

17---
in the winter period. Fáilte Ireland research suggests that Overseas Holidaymakers on

average spend €96 per day and Domestic Overnight Visitors spend €74 per day.

Applied to visitors to the Cliffs of Moher Experience this would generate an estimated

total economic impact of €141million euros. While it’s acknowledged there is

economic leakage outside of County Clare, there is still a considerable level of indirect

benefit to the County. This includes the towns and villages around the Cliffs of Moher

Experience through overnight accommodation, food and beverage, spin off cottage

industries, micro industry, service suppliers and employment expenditure. Furthermore,

the Cliffs of Moher Experience has an international market reach and long term

relationships which are used along with use of the marketing budget to leverage

business for Shannon Airport, Clare attractions, accommodation providers and other

tourism related businesses.

Most coach licences issued by Clare County Council stop in another location within the

County as well as the Cliffs of Moher Experience. Fáilte Ireland estimates that every

€1 million of tourism expenditure supports 27 tourism jobs. The scale of the economic

impact of the Cliffs of Moher Experience from direct expenditure and visitor

expenditure is considerable. Cliffs of Moher Experience supports tourism and

community related activities and continue to build relationships with local communities

providing opportunity to engage with Cliffs of Moher Experience across a multitude of

items.

**3. A continual mechanism of involvement in oversight in the implementation of**

**the Strategy for representatives nominated by the host community of**

**Ennistymon LEA.**

Clare County Council has the function for management and operation of the Cliffs of

Moher experience, policy development and oversight of the implementation of the

Cliffs of Moher Strategy 2040. This executive function is overseen by the Rural

Development Directorate with cross-directorate and Management Team involvement

as per local government functions.

At a policy level, the Rural Development SPC provides policy oversight together with

the external policy perspective of the board as such a mechanism. The Clare Tourism

Advisory Forum also has a strategic role in this regard and particularly in relation to

the interaction of the Cliffs of Moher Strategy 2040 and the Clare Tourism Strategy

2030. The Forum involves representation from industry, business, community. There

are also Elected Members represented on the Forum, who carry a direct link to the

Council.

In order to create a broad representation of expertise and input to the future of the Cliffs

of Moher, the board of the Cliffs of Moher DAC was expanded four years ago by Clare

County Council. The Board fulfils this oversight mechanism. The Board’s function is

advisory in relation to strategic direction and responsible in terms of full compliance

with company law as a host employer. The Elected Members of Clare County Council

have two representatives on the Board of the Cliffs of Moher DAC (Cllr. Shane Talty

and Cllr. Gabriel Keating). Both are very active and involved in the oversight of the

Strategy. The executive of Clare County Council are also represented on the board and

accordingly manage all aspects of the Cliffs of Moher. The Board already includes two

community representatives from the North Clare Area both of whom have a broad range

of community experience. They contribute hugely on issues and concerns of the local

community, who communicate regularly with them and directly entrust the raising of

18---
their community concerns. They also raise opportunities for collaboration and

coordination on marketing and projects. This input of the community representatives

dovetails with that of two Elected Members who also fulfil this role. Any ideas and

inputs from the host community can certainly be inputted through this structured and

well-tested approach. The Board benefits from other members’ expertise including

business, legal, HR, marketing, strategic management, commercial development etc.

Clare County Council is committed to ongoing engagement with local host

communities on the implementation of the Cliffs of Moher Strategy 2040. This has been

the hallmark of the consultation phase. The immediate next step is the preparation of a

draft Strategy. Further consultation with the community and stakeholders will follow

the publication of a first draft Strategy before preparing a final draft. The feedback from

the host community, and indeed the wider community of Clare, has been very positive

towards the Cliffs of Moher at all workshops held to date.”

The elected members agreed that the Cliffs of Moher is the economic driver for the

entire county and noted its value to tourism. The elected members welcomed the

agreement to include a ‘towns and villages pillar’ as part of the Cliffs of Moher

Strategy 2040. The members felt that the Cliffs of Moher should be managed in a

way that will continue to contribute to the enjoyment for the people who live there

permanently.

**Offshore wind/wave energy.**

Ar moladh Cllr. J. Killeen

Cuidithe ag Cllr. I. Lynch agus glacadh leis

“We call on Clare County Council, our Oireachtas Members, our Members of the

European Parliament to outline efforts made/to be made to promote the harnessing of

offshore wind / wave energy and efforts to position Clare as the location that

companies throughout Europe will choose when considering investment in renewable

energy.

We further call for a seminar in the Autumn on the subject of renewable energy both

large scale and smallscale involving experts in this field, Oireachtas Members, M E P

s and other relevant parties.”

**Brian McCarthy, Senior Engineer replied as follows:**

“The Members will be aware that currently the Shannon Estuary Economic Task Force,

which the Chief Executive is a member of, is examining all opportunities for economic

development with respect to the Shannon Estuary. It is noted that the Terms of

Reference for the Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce are to:

a. Assess the strategic strengths and comparative advantages of the Shannon

Estuary from an investment and enterprise development perspective, in a

national and international context;

b. Scope potential areas of opportunity for the Shannon Estuary and specify policy

and investment requirements to exploit those areas of potential;

c. Assess the current connectivity of the region and make recommendations as to

how this could be enhanced;

19---
d. Specify the actions required from national and local government, as well as from

other stakeholders, to exploit those areas of potential; and

e. Produce a Report and associated Action Plan with specific steps in areas of

potential.

Whilst the focus of the Task force naturally is on the opportunities that can benefit the

entire estuary, it is clear that opportunities and prosperity can accrue to County Clare.

Noting the sentiments of the Notice of Motion, and notwithstanding the ongoing

consideration of the Task Force and its focus on the entire estuary, from a County Clare

perspective, members will be aware that Clare County Council led the development by

a multi-agency steering group of the *Strategic Integrated Framework Plan for the*

*Shannon Estuary (SIFP)*. The land and marine-based plan, the first of its type to be

developed in the country, has informed decisions, policy and in particular significant

investment decisions along the entire estuary. Moneypoint and Cahercon are identified

in the SIFP as Strategic Development Locations. The Chief Executive is the Chair of

the SIFP implementation group.

Moreover, Clare County Council, through its Strategic Economic Initiatives unit (SEI),

has proactively led a number of initiatives to increase the proposition and attractiveness

of County Clare for inward investment and economic development arising from

opportunities from off-shore renewables. These include the assistance and collaboration

with a tidal test device company to locate a tidal test device off Cahercon – currently

under assessment for a Foreshore Licence; the proposal to establish a Maritime Training

Centre in Kilrush to provide a location for training for the undoubted opportunities for

employment and training that the off-shore sector will require; and the management by

the SEI of large scale scientific data gathering across the estuary to ensure that

availability of scientific data to assist with project development and assessments.

Clare County Council is seeking to maximise all efforts and advantages that Clare’s

natural and infrastructural resources and talented workforce have to ensure that off-

shore renewables can be harnessed sustainably for the county. There are also several

factors and stakeholders at national and EU level and from the private sector,

international corporations, wind energy developers and infrastructural providers

necessary to realise the opportunities. It is also vital that communities and stakeholders

are central to the consideration and benefit of opportunities from renewable energy.

The Shannon Estuary Taskforce Report is anticipated to be completed by the end of

this year and will be presented to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and

Employment. It will subsequently be considered by Government. In that context, the

Task Force Report is a key next step and regarding the request for organising a seminar

it may be appropriate to also wait until the publication of the Report and any

recommendations.”

The elected members felt that Clare County Council should promote renewable

energy as the highest wind speeds in Europe are in the West coast of Ireland. The

members expressed concern at the short time available to prepare submissions for the

Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce as they felt expert advice is necessary as well

as the need to ensure that the submission is cohesive and strong as this is a key

opportunity for County Clare. The members agreed that there is merit in hosting a

seminar in the autumn on the subject of renewable energy both large scale and small

scale involving experts in this field.

20---
P. Dowling, Chief Executive stated that engagement has taken place with companies

in relation to offshore wind wave energy on the Shannon Estuary. Mr. Dowling stated

that the Government has set up the Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce who will

bring ideas back to Government after the public consultation phase has been

completed. Mr. Dowling undertook to ask Brian, McCarthy, Senior Planner to liaise

with the elected members before the end of July and compile a submission. Mr.

Dowling stated that it is possible to host a seminar at the end of August and that the

draft report will be compiled by then.

“Clare County Council requests Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly to investigate

the possibility of creating a "Smart ID Card" especially for elderly people.

These Smart ID cards would contain information like date of birth, PPS number,

allergies, health conditions, surgeries etc these would be especially useful if they need

to attend hospital or A&E.”

The members agreed that “Smart ID card” containing peoples personal information

and medical history would benefit people being brought to hospital and protect

people’s dignity in busy waiting rooms. It was also felt that it would reduce the cost

of storing paper files.

**Item 23.**

“Clare County Council request the GAA to use local bands like Ennis Brass Band or

the Tulla Pipe Band to play the National Anthem - "Amhrán na bhFiann" before

important home games.”

The members felt that as Clare is the home of traditional music that local bands

should play the national anthem before home games.

It was noted that there is a positive partnership between Clare County Council and

Clare GAA and that the present executive are open to ideas on how to improve

matters going forward.

**Item 24.**

Cuidithe ag Cllr. P. McMahon agus glacadh leis

“That this council would request that the Minister for Transport and the TII would

provide toilets and parking facilities on the N18/M18 in the Clare section.”

The elected members agreed that parking and toilet facilities should be provided on

the N18/M18 as the current situation whereby people are using the side of the

21---
motorway as a toilet is a safety issue. It was also felt that parking should be provided

for commercial vehicles and buses to enable drivers take the rest period stipulated.

**Item 25.**

**Housing emergency.**

“I call on this Council to call on the Government and Minister for Housing to declare

a housing emergency and use emergency powers to introduce an immediate

moratorium on evictions, similar to that during covid, to be reviewed after 3 months

and that the Minister increase the income threshold limits for social housing support,

during this time.”

The members noted that people are facing eviction and are unable to source

accommodation as the rent is unaffordable and that families who are taking family

members into their homes is leading to overcrowded conditions. It was also noted

that many people getting mortgage approval cannot afford to buy and are earning too

much to get housing support. The members agreed that people need accommodation

security.

**Item 26.**

**C.S.O. figures.**

Ar moladh Cllr. C. Murphy

Cuidithe ag Cllr. P. Hayes agus glacadh leis

“That the forward planning section of Clare County Council seek clarity from the

‘Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage’ and/or the ‘Office of the

Planning Regulator’ as to the consequences of the recently announced preliminary

CSO census figures on the proposed core strategy population allocations for the

County Development Plan. The current core strategy allows for a projected growth of

9.94% (to 130,454) above the 2016 figures up to 2029, however, given the recent

preliminary CSO census figures show a population growth of 7.2% (127,419) for Co

Clare from 2016 to date, clarity is required as to whether County Clare will be

restricted to the same population allocation, a growth of 3,035 in real terms, over the 6

year lifetime of the plan.”

**Helen Quinn, A/Senior Planner replied as follows:**

“The preliminary data published by the Central Statistics Office relating to the Census

conducted in 2022 showed that Ireland’s population on census night was 5,123,536, an

increase of 7.6% from 2016. The population in Co. Clare in 2022 is 127,419, an increase

of 8,602 person on the 2016 figure, representing a 7.2% change.

I have sought clarity from both the OPR and the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage on the content of this motion as requested.

The OPR have responded to say that they have no comment to make on foot of the

motion. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have indicated

that they do not intend to review the Housing Supply Targets Methodology for

Development Planning, Guidelines for Planning Authorities issued under Section 28 of

the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended) in December 2020 on foot of

the preliminary CSO data from this year’s census. The census data is due to be finalised

22---
in 2023 and at that stage the Department will consider further any reviews that they

consider necessary.

I can confirm to the members that the Planning Department have had regard to the CSO

census preliminary figures published on Thursday, 23rd June 2022 in the preparation of

Chief Executive’s Report to the Elected Members on the submissions received on the

Draft Clare County Development Plan 2023-2029, which will have been with the

members ahead of this meeting for their consideration. I would also like to direct the

members’ attention to the Housing Supply Targets Methodology for Development

Planning, Guidelines for Planning Authorities, from which the Planning Authority will

derive a target number of housing units to be delivered over the life of the upcoming

plan 2023-2029. This housing supply target will be unchanged as a result of the recent

CSO census preliminary figures as it does not directly correlate to population allocation.

In the interests of clarity, the members are reminded that the land zoning objectives for

the upcoming plan will reflect the Housing Supply Targets rather than a population

allocation.

There will be ample opportunity for the members to engage in discussions relating to

the CSO census data, the Housing Supply Target Methodology and the quantum of

zoning to be included in the upcoming development plan over the coming months,

while the members consider the Chief Executive’s Report referred to above. I consider

that this consideration stage is the most appropriate forum to have discussions relating

to the development plan and I look forward to the members participation in the

upcoming workshops.”

The elected members expressed disappointment that population projections on which

future social, economic and environmental development are based are not being taken

into account. It was noted that Clare has already reached 75% of its future projected

population growth until 2029 and that no clarity is being provided. The members felt

that the recent change in population information from the CSO is a significant

material alteration of the assumptions used to plan for how this county will develop

over the next development plan timeframe.

P. Dowling, Chief Executive acknowledged that this aspect of the County

Development Plan has dominated for a few years and supported the view to set

ambitions targets going forward. Mr. Dowling stated that 1,015 valid submissions

have been received in relation to the draft County Development Plan and that the

report produced on submissions received has issued to the Councillors.

**Item 27.**

**Housing support measures.**

Ar moladh Cllr. G. Flynn

Cuidithe ag Cllr. D. McGettigan agus glacadh leis

“I am calling on the Minister dealing with Housing to urgently address the issues

facing members of the public in Clare who are denied access to housing support

measures due to the failure by the Government to address the very low income

thresholds in Clare as a result of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011

that are seriously out of touch with the current economic realities where the cost of

rent and the availability of rental property is contributing to homelessness for a lot of

people who are struggling to survive on their current income.”

23---
The members agreed that the anomaly that exists in relation to income thresholds

needs to be addressed urgently. The members noted that the income threshold was

last addressed in March 2011 and that it is out of touch with reality. The members

outlined details of constituents who are PAYE workers and cannot receive supports

and felt that these restrictions are unjust. The members agreed that the current policy

needs to be amended in order to provide support to people.

Cllr. G. Flynn requested that this notice of motion be forwarded to Clare Oireachtas

member and this was agreed by the members present.

**Item 28.**

**Early childcare sector availability.**

Ar moladh Cllr. S. Talty

Cuidithe ag Cllr. P. O’Gorman agus glacadh leis

“Ask that Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Roderick

O'Gorman urgently address the lack of availability in the early childcare sector.

Publicly supported facilities are operating far beyond capacity while small individual

private operators are opting out of the sector. Much public debate centres on

affordability, but availability is rapidly becoming a greater obstacle for parents.”

The elected members stated that growing population has exacerbated demand for

childcare in some private operated and government funded services and there are

hundreds of children on waiting lists to access services. It was noted that there are

highly skilled, employable people moving back to County Clare and that many cannot

take up employment as they have to care for their family due to the absence of

sufficient availability of childcare.

**Item 29.**

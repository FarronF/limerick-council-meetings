The Senior Executive Engineer, Planning, Place-Making and Public Realm gave an update to

in funding. The Senior Executive Engineer stated that he has spoken to the National Transport

3.

Housing Directorate

To receive Update from the Housing Directorate for the Newcastle

West Municipal District.

Circulated, report of Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non LA Housing Construction

dated 24th June, 2022.

The Director of Service, Housing Directorate referred to the report circulated in advance of

the Meeting and outlined the target of 198 properties between 2022 and 2026 for the District.

She outlined that the focus is currently on building houses rather than acquiring them and

referred to the pressure on the housing list due to current housing needs and the Ukrainian

crisis. She stated that all options are being considered at present.

The Members referred to the report and to a number of matters including the delivery date

on a number of the units mentioned on the circulated report.

The Members also sought an update on the unfinished housing estate at Cois na Féile,

Abbeyfeale. In replying, the Administrative Officer, Housing Strategy outlined that they are---

due to meet the AHB next week to agree a schedule and that a new planning application is

required as a number of the units will need to be demolished. The Members expressed

disappointment that a house needs to be demolished during the current housing crisis and

also referred to a number of matters including footpath connectivity and anti-social behaviour

taking place on the adjoining land. It was agreed that the Housing Department would engage

further with the landowner on this matter.

Reference was also made to the recently installed door on the vacant property at New

Street, Abbeyfeale and if this door could be changed which would improve the aesthetic of

the streetscape.

A discussion followed on the proposed housing development at Woodfield Manor, Newcastle

West and to the provision of social housing or affordable housing at this estate. The Director

advised that the Incremental Purchase Scheme was aimed at applicants who are approved

for social housing.

It was noted that the first 19 units at the Woodfield Manor estate are to be allocated under

the Incremental Purchase Scheme. However the Director advised that while there were 28

applicants it looked as though only 7 of these will meet the eligibility criteria. A question was

raised if the remaining 12 units can be utilised for Affordable Housing and in replying the

Director stated that she would need to seek confirmation from the Department of Housing,

Local Government and Heritage as the Affordable Housing Scheme was not in existence when

the Council proceeded with the scheme and these houses had already been accounted for

under social housing targets.

The Members referred to a number of matters including assurances given at previous

meetings in relation to Woodfield Manor estate, the benefits of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme

for people who are in financial difficulty where they could remain in their own homes and the

installation of traffic lights at Woodfield Manor estate in the interest of safety. Reference was

also made to the number of houses being refurbished in the District at present.

Following discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Scanlan, seconded by Councillor Ruddle

that the following Notice of Motion be referred to the Corporate Services Section for inclusion

on the Agenda of the next Full Council Meeting as this matter relates to a change in National

Policy “I will move at the next Meeting that if the 19 units at Woodfield Manor estate are not

filled through the Incremental Purchase Scheme that Limerick City and County Council call on

the Minister for Housing, Local Government & Heritage to increase the income eligibility

bands for Social Housing”.

This property was acquired by Limerick City and County Council under the Derelict Sites

Act 1990. It was vested on 17th August 2020.

A feasibility study was completed to refurbish as a 1 bed dwelling, but waste water

connection is currently not permissible in Askeaton as the waste system is at capacity.

This is a Recorded Protected Structure. Expressions of interest were sought from the

public as to a proposed use, but no candidate came forward with concrete proposals.

Agreement has been reached with Mr Tom Cassidy, Conservation Advisor of LCCC, re

works required to arrest the deterioration of the property by stabilisation and

protection from weather.

Tenders are being prepared, by the Property and Community Facilities Department,

under the RLHD project, to provide structural stability, new timber roof structure and

provide roof finish to arrest further deterioration, until such time as a use has been

found for the property.

Any interest or funded proposals for the future of this property would be most welcome.---

Notices of Motion

7.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Carey, Mitchell and E.

Ryan

We will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District Meeting

that the unfinished development of 7 apartments at Wolfe Tone St., Kilmallock be put on

the market with a view to be sold to any interested developers and brought back into viable

housing provision

**Reply:**

The property in question is on the Derelict Sites Register and has been acquired

compulsorily by Limerick City and County Council under the Derelict Sites Act 1990.
---
A structural assessment has deemed that the unfinished and derelict structure is not suited

to repair and completion. In addition, there are planning/flood risk constraints associated

with the site.

In the view of the above, it would not be appropriate to put the property for sale and a

decision has been made to demolish the unfinished/derelict structure on the site.

*An Cathaoirleach outlined that in order for this Notice of Motion to be passed, there would*

*need to be a vote to rescind a Notice of Motion submitted in September 2021 by Councillor*

*Donegan for the apartments to be demolished and passed, which was read to the Elected*

*Members as follows:*

*“* I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District calling on

Limerick City and County Council to complete the demolition of the unfinished three story

building on Wolfe Tone Street, Kilmallock.”

*The vote was called to rescind the Notice of Motion and the Elected Members voted as*

*follows (Yes to rescind the Notice of Motion to demolish the apartments (September 2021)*

*and No to retain the Notice of Motion to demolish the apartments (September 2021):*

*Councillor Carey: Abstained and left the meeting*

*Councillor Donegan: No*

*Councillor Egan: No*

*Councillor Mitchell: No*

*Councillor M Ryan: No*

*Councillor Teefy: No*

*The Vote was unanimously opposed and therefore the Notice of Motion submitted by*

*Councillor Donegan to demolish the building on Wolfe Tone Street was not rescinded.*

*The Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Carey, Mitchell and E Ryan to put the*

*apartments on the market to be sold therefore cannot be passed.*

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District calling on

Limerick City and County Council to include Kilbehenny village in the recently announced

scheme by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to improve the

wastewater needs of rural villages and to be included in the Department’s overall Multi-

Annual Rural Water Programme 2022-2025.

**Reply:**

Minister Darragh O’Brien recently announced a new funding stream, Measure A8, under the

Multi Annual Rural Water Programme, aimed at assisting in the provision of Waste Water

Treatment Facilities to villages and settlements, **without access to public sewers**.
---
Local Authorities have been invited to submit a maximum of two proposals for funding under

this measure, accompanied by a Feasibility Study, by September 15th, 2022.

Under this first tranche of funding, applications are limited to villages/settlements with a

‘core area’ that has at least 150 population equivalent, based on its existing residential

population.

The following criteria will be applied:

1) Villages/settlements must be expressly listed in the current County Development Plan

for the local authority and are a ‘priority location’ as detailed in the Framework

document.

or

2) Villages/settlements that are not expressly listed in the County Development Plan for

the local authority and where, in the opinion of the local authority, a need has been

identified and is objectively evidenced. Village/settlements in this situation will only

be considered on an exceptional and objectively evidenced basis.

It is also worth noting that under this Measure, Local Authorities are required to co-fund

approved projects, up to 15% of the approved costs.

Consultations have begun within Limerick City and County Council, with staff from Forward

Planning Section, Rural Water, and Water Services WasteWater Department. The purpose of

these discussions is to identify what villages or settlements will qualify under the criteria, and

to identify any potential income stream to meet the required matching funding.

We will provide further updates to the Members prior to the deadline for submission of

proposals.

*Councillor Donegan outlined that he would welcome a phone call or written reply from*

*Caroline O’Kane (Senior Executive Officer, Water Services) as to the exact position regarding*

*the application and Kilbehenny specifically. The Elected Members highlighted that future*

*developments in Kilbehenny will be impacted if not included in the programme as waste*

*water treatment is required for 15-20 homes in the village.*

**Proposed: Councillor Donegan**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan**

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that the use

of averaging Speed cameras in towns and villages be considered in the Municipal District

where speed is a concern.

**Reply:**

Averaging speed camera pilot studies are currently being carried out by TII on the

national/motorway network. The use of these cameras and their appropriateness in towns

and villages within the Cappamore-Kilmallock would be premature at present as it is likely

their use would be governed by national policy. Limerick City and County Council will liaise
---
with both TII and the Dept. of Transport to discuss Cllr. Ryan’s motion and determine the

plans and policy that TII and the DOT may have for their use in the future.

**Proposed: Councillor M Ryan**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

*It was agreed that this Notice of Motion be brought to the Travel and Transportation SPC*

*and then, if agreed, to the Full Council for discussion. This was supported by all Elected*

*Members present.*

*It was noted that should the Notice of Motion be passed at Full Council a Data Protection*

*Impact Assessment would need to be undertaken.*

*A request was made that the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District be considered for a*

*pilot scheme if funding was made available. This would have to be discussed with Transport*

*Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Transport.*

QUESTIONS

10.

Question submitted by Councillor Carey

I will ask at the next Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District Meeting for an update from

the Forward Planning Section regarding the proposed Community Sports Hub in Kilmallock,

which would be located just outside the LAP boundary/settlement on the R512, Ardvullen,

Gotoon

**Reply:**

The Forward Planning Section intend to commence the review of the Local Area Plan for

Kilmallock later this year. As part of this process detailed analysis will be undertaken, to

determine the future development needs of the town in line with the requirements of the

recently adopted Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028. The Team will engage regularly

with the Elected Members of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District throughout the

process.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor Carey

I will ask at the next Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District Meeting for an update from

the Forward Planning Section regarding the proposed re-zoning, as discussed at the

workshop delivered in December 2021 , from Residential to Commercial, on the Ash Hill

Manor entrance, Kilmallock, R515.

**Reply:**

The Forward Planning Section intend to commence the review of the Local Area Plan for

Kilmallock later this year. As part of this process detailed analysis will be undertaken,

including the consideration of existing zoned lands, to determine the future development

needs of the town in line with the requirements of the recently adopted Limerick
---
Development Plan 2022-2028. The team will engage regularly with the Elected Members of

the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District throughout the process.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the Nicker to Old Pallas Walkway, following the recently completed investigative works.

**Reply:**

The Cappamore-Kilmallock MD office submitted a proposal for a new footpath from Old

Pallas to Pallasgreen at the end of 2021 for consideration by the NTA for funding in 2022.

This application has been unsuccessful to date. In the interim, the Roads Maintenance Team

have skirted the existing verge to reclaim as much of the road surface as possible. This has

resulted in the road surface being widened by up to 600mm. It is not possible to widen the

road any further without the removal of existing roadside boundaries.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District meeting for an

update on the timeframe for turnaround of current voids

**Reply:**

**REPLY:**

(a) Pre-lets/Voids

Pre-lets and voids are returned through the area office.

These are returned through the use of the direct labour teams and contractors depending

upon the nature of works and volume of works on hand at any particular time. This blend is

the most effective method for returns as it can make best use of the particular advantages

of both approaches. Using contractors allows additional resources to be mobilised as

required while direct labour teams are very flexible and can respond at short notice as may

be required.

The outline procedure is that on the return of the dwelling it is firstly inspected to

determine the level of works required. A cost estimate is then prepared and the dwelling is

issued to the area for return works to be undertaken. A budget is allocated for completion

of the works. Using either direct labour or contractors is an operational decision based upon

the workload at the time and the nature and extent of works required.

As at July 7th Housing Maintenance have 5 units in the process of being returned through

pre-lets/voids:
---
o 2 have been returned and to be inspected

o 3 on-site and works are progressing with completion dates over the next month

Housing Construction have 10 units in the process of being returned or being added to the

housing stock through various streams – these are packaged in Lots.

o **Lot 1** – 4 units – at Tender stage – Buy and Renew Acquisition

(new units to the stock – Part 8 running parallel for 2 of the 4 units).

o **Lot 2** – construction underway – no units in Cp/Km MD

o **Lot 3** – 2 units in design stage.

o **Lot 4** - no units for Cp/Km MD

o **Lot 5** – 2units being scoped – application for funding being made

o **Lot 6** – no units for Cp/Km MD

o **Lot 7** – 2 units – recent additions

(b) Maintenance of stock

Stock within the Municipal District of Cappamore/Kilmallock is maintained through the

housing maintenance team in the district.

Each area has a direct labour team and use contractors as required for particular services

(plumbing, electrical etc.) This mix allows flexibility which can respond as required to the

fluctuating level of maintenance requests.

Requests for maintenance are received through Customer Services, cases are created and

logged and entered on to the Sugar/CRM system. They are then allocated to the relevant

area and team for action (Housing Maintenance).

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock District for ramps to be installed

in Knocklong immediately in the interest of health and safety.

**Reply:**

vehicular speeds through the village. If the vehicular speeds are determined to be excessive,

appropriate traffic calming measures will be designed and the normal consultation and

funding applications will be carried out.

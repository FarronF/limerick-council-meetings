**8.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council when the planned upgrades of the Children’s**Playground***

***in the Peoples Park will start and what if any additional play facilities will be included.***

**REPLY**: The Council requested an initial design for the playground to match the €150,000 GMA

budget allocation for the redevelopment of People’s Park playground. The purpose of this

approach was to establish the extent of equipment and play surfacing that could be

provided with this level of funding. The budget has subsequently been increased to

€195,000 with a contribution from Limerick Sports Partnership for inclusive play equipment.

The provision of inclusive play equipment is a focus for the redevelopment of the

playground and in this regard, the Council are commencing an inclusive survey to seek

feedback from interested parties on what they would like to see in the newly developed

playground.

The Council will advertise for tenders next week and any feedback sought through the

consultation process that has not been taken into consideration in the new design will be

communicated to the successful tenderer.

Park, it may restrict future opportunities for events in the Park for example Riverfest and

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

14. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting that**the Metropolitan District of Limerick**write to the Minister***

***for Transport and to the NTA asking that the existing 304a bus service in Castletroy/Monaleen is***

***extended to Annacotty and Groody/Ballysimon Road as soon as possible.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M) and

agreed.---
7

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the difficulties caused by the suspension of

the private bus service to the Castletroy and Annacotty area. She stated this was an area with a

growing population, which had further proposals for new housing estates, a primary school and a

private hospital and a bus service to cover the entire area was urgently required.

15. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick engage with the Data***

***Protection Commission and An Garda Síochána to explore the feasibility of installing CCTV***

***cameras at the following locations:***

***Castletroy Playground***

***Boro Park in Janesboro***

***Plassey Credit Union Bottle Bank in Castletroy.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Kiely and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas stated that damage had recently been caused to the

newly refurbished Castletroy Playground and illegal dumping had occurred at the Bottle Bank in

Plassey and if CCTV was installed at these locations, it would act as a deterrent.

**REPLY**: As a result of the Data Protection Commission’s (DPC) audit and final report on Limerick City

and County Council’s use of CCTV, published in December 2021, the Head of Digital Services,

Alan Dooley, lead an effort to remediate the serious and significant findings in that report.

One of the more significant outcomes from the DPC’s final report was that all public CCTV

cameras must have a valid legal basis.

In this respect, the only legal basis that exists for public realm CCTV is Section 38 of An Garda

Síochána Act 2005. This provides the legal basis for Community CCTV schemes to secure

public order and safety only.

Currently, there is no legal basis available at this time for CCTV to be installed in public parks

or at bottle collection points.

16. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that one of the soccer***

***pitches at Kennedy Park, Limerick be left with the local Club so that the local community can***

***benefit from the soccer pitch.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery and seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council advertised an Expression of Interest for clubs to submit an

application for a 12-month licence over two pitches in Kennedy Park, Limerick. The issue of

a Licence is an executive function and is not subject to S183 approval.

Following an appeal to the original decision, the Expression of Interest Process was

reviewed and has now concluded with the final decision of Gordon Daly, Director of Service,

Community, Tourism and Culture on the matter as follows:---
8

1. To offer a 12 month licence over pitch 2 to Newtown Rovers FC

2. To offer a 12 month licence over pitch 1 to Carew Park FC

The clubs have been notified of this decision.

The Head of Property and Community Facilities outlined the process by which the licences were

awarded.

After a discussion on the use of the pitches and benefit to the community, the following amended

Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M):

**“That the original decision of the Review Board to award licences for both pitches to one Club**

**be upheld”.**

A vote was taken on the amended motion, which resulted as follows:

**For the Amended Motion**:

Councillors Benson, Butler, Collopy, Hartigan, Kiely, McSweeney, Murphy, O’Sullivan and Sheahan

(M).

(9)

**Against the Amended Motion**:

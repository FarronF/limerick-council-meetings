**QUESTIONS**

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will ask at the next meeting for an up to date report on sewerage issues in Askeaton.**
---

**Reply:**

I wish to advise that the Council has recently been in communication with

the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to

the ongoing issues at the waste-water treatment plant in Askeaton and

seeking to accelerate progress on investment in the plant, which is now

long overdue.

Under the draft City and County Development Plan 2022-2028, Askeaton

is targeted to increase its population by 28% or an additional 119

households. The delivery of improved waste water infrastructure for

Askeaton is critical for the implementation of objectives contained in the

draft plan.

As soon as any further information has been received from the

Department, this will be communicated to the members at the earliest

opportunity.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will ask at the next meeting what plans do the Council have for the thatched cottage**

**in Askeaton known as “Hartes Cottage”.**

**Reply:**

This property was acquired by Limerick City and County Council under the

Derelict Sites Act 1990. It was vested on 17th August 2020. The property

is a protected structure.

Unfortunately the Covid restrictions limited the progress of addressing

this property. However, there has been communication with local

Community Groups and a mini expression of interest was entered into

whereby the groups who had made contact with LCCC were requested to

return proposed future uses for the building and proposed funding for

same.

No adequate application was received.

Discussions have also taken place with Tom Cassidy, Conservation Officer,

LCCC re the types of development that may be allowed to the property.

The property has a lot of issues including no on-site service which would

have to be overcome if development was to proceed.

The Property and Community Facilities department, under the Rural

Limerick Housing Development section is continuing to review options for

this property, as it may require substantial investment, depending on the

option decided upon.

Any interest or funded proposals for the future of this property would be

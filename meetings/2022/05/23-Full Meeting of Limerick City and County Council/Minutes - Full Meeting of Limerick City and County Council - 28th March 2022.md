Some Members referred to discussions on this at a previous Metropolitan District Meeting,

where concerns were expressed in relation to this proposed disposal. Members had

highlighted that the property was in an important tourist location and the importance of it
---
9

being utilised to the fullest extent possible, given its location and tourism objectives for the

area. They had also agreed that the property ideally should be open for use outside of normal

office hours if possible too. They also queried what objectives had been met in relation to the

criteria outlined in the Expression of Interest document that had been issued as part of the

disposal process, and what options had been considered for the use of the building.

The Administrative Officer, Property and Community Facilities confirmed that several

Expressions of Interest had been received, but that concrete funding proposals were not

included in most of the Expressions of Interests received. She also confirmed that as the

building was a protected structure, that it would be a costly process to refurbish the building

to return it back to a satisfactory condition. She explained that this was the reason it was so

difficult to get a purchaser who could meet all the suggested criteria. She also confirmed that

other properties for disposal in the area would be coming before the Members in due course,

which might meet more of the particular tourism objectives being sought by some Members.

The Director, Regeneration also confirmed that regeneration funding was not available to

refurbish the building and that a community centre was not being considered at this location.

Some Members also highlighted the fact that the building had been derelict for over 30 years

and was in a tourist area, and that it was important to try to get it restored and back into use,

rather than leave it derelict for a further period of time.

**Recommendation No. 3 (from SPC Meeting of 14th** **March, 2022)**

**‘That, Limerick City and County Council call on the Government to change national**

**policy to support the liquid natural gas plant at Ballylongford.’**

In proposing this Motion, Cllr Sheahan (J) stated that the provision of a liquid natural

gas plant at Ballylongford should be supported by the Government so as to provide

another alternative energy option for Ireland, and that this was especially important

at the current time having regard to current increased energy costs which were due

primarily to the recent war in the Ukraine. He also stated that it was important that

Ireland should be as self-sufficient as possible in managing its energy demands and

had to be realistic in how it would achieve this. He also stated that it could be possible

in the future to convert the liquid natural gas plant to hydrogen as well.

While some Members were in favour of this proposal, other Members stated their

opposition to it on the basis that Ireland should be choosing renewable energy options

instead and that it was not appropriate to be developing a liquid natural gas plant at

this location. Some Members stated that there were sufficient gas supplies in Europe

already and that alternatives like wind and tidal energy generation measures were

what Ireland should be pursuing given its location on the edge of Western Europe.

Following these discussions, the Mayor directed that a vote be taken on the proposal to call

on the Government to change national policy to support the liquid natural gas plant at

Ballylongford, and the result of the voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillors Colllins (M), Donegan, Foley, Galvin, Keary, Kilcoyne, McSweeney, Murphy,

O’Donoghue, O’Hanlon, Ruddle, Ryan (E), Ryan (M), Scanlon (J), Sheahan (J), Sheahan (K),

**(7)**
---

**Abstain**

Councillors Butler, Collins (B), Costelloe, Kiely, O’Sullivan, Secas.

**(6)**

The Mayor declared the vote on the proposal to call on the Government to change national

policy to support the liquid natural gas plant at Ballylongford as passed, and accordingly the

following resolution was adopted.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Galvin;

And Resolved:

‘That, Limerick City and County Council call on the Government to change national policy to

support the liquid natural gas plant at Ballylongford.’

**Recommendation No. 4 (from SPC Meeting of 14th** **March, 2022)**

**‘That, the increase in burial ground charges be reversed.’**

In proposing his Notice of Motion, Cllr Teskey referred to the increase in the cost of grave

spaces, which were introduced at the start of January 2022, which he described as excessive.

Members expressed disappointment that this increase had not being flagged with them and

that there was a lot of public resentment and anger at the increase. They also noted that this

was a very sensitive issue for people and that the costs involved were very high.

They also noted that the Burial Ground Maintenance Grant was very small in comparison,

despite the tremendous work being carried out by Burial Ground Committees. While the

Members agreed that the Council Budget had to be balanced in order to cover all aspects of

the Councils activities, they agreed that this issue was particularly sensitive. Members asked

if the shortfall could be covered by forward sales of grave spaces in graveyards instead.

The Deputy Chief Executive briefed the Members on the costs involved in operating the burial

ground service where the annual operating cost was €1.7m, while income was €820k per

annum. He also outlined details of the Burial Ground Capital Programme, which entailed

Capital Expenditure of €4.5m. He referred to the operating costs in adjacent local authority

areas, which varied quite significantly and noted that every local authority had different issues

and approaches in relation to the delivery of this service.

The Chief Executive noted the concerns raised by Members in relation to this issue and agreed

that the Executive would take it away to review the feedback from Members and look at the

cost implications involved and would revert back to the Members in due course.

On the proposal of Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), the

Recommendation was ‘that, the increase in burial ground charges be reversed.’

With the permission of the Mayor, the following Notice of Motion - No. 20 - was taken

in conjunction with this Recommendation:

**20.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Authority bring the cost of grave space in Rural**

**County Limerick into line with that charged for graves in our neighbouring Authorities of**

**Kerry and Clare.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Scanlan and seconded by Councillor Ryan (E).

**REPLY*:***

The Council reviewed burial ground charges as part of the budgetary process

for 2022. The decision to increase the cost of graves arose for a number of

reasons, including the reduction in income received from sale of graves, the

increased demand for maintenance works, in particular in the County burial

grounds and the increased costs associated with same.

The Council adopted a Burial Ground Strategy in 2021, and this strategy has

revealed that a number of burial grounds need to be developed, including the

provision of Columbarium Walls. Therefore, the monies generated are key to

the delivery of this work programme and to ongoing service delivery.

The Council, in taking this decision, undertook a review of the cost of grave

spaces across urban and rural local authorities, including neighbouring local

authorities. The proposed charges are considered to be appropriately

benchmarked with other local authorities. The proposal also for the first time

aligns charges across the Limerick City and County area and establishes a fair

and consistent approach to same.

ADJOURNED NOTICE OF MOTION

8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council give its full support to***

***commemorate the five hundred year anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Askeaton***

***taking place in June 2023.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (K) and seconded by Councillor

Collins (M).

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council recognises that public commemoration and

memorials offer opportunities to honour, celebrate, or remember a person,

group of persons or events of significance. They provide an opportunity to

highlight important social, cultural and economic contributions to society, to

celebrate the uniqueness of the city and county of Limerick and to create a

‘sense of place’ which is identified as being of great importance to citizens and

visitors.

Limerick City and County Council Civic Memorial Policy sets out the process by

which Limerick City and County Council will consider the commemoration of

events or individuals who have shaped the city or county, either by the naming

of infrastructure or by the installation of monuments, memorials and plaques

in the public domain.

A Civic Memorial and Public Art Technical Committee was established by

Limerick City and County Council in 2020 to make recommendations regarding

the naming of key infrastructure and the selection of individuals or events that

will be commemorated through the erection of civic monuments or plaques.
---
17

It is recommended that this proposal be forwarded to the Limerick City and

County Council Civic Memorial and Public Art Technical Committee for

consideration.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the agenda were circulated to all Members prior

to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

9.

Question submitted by Councillor F. Daly

***I will ask at the next Meeting are we not going to acknowledge Limerick Senior Hurling***

***Champions 2020/21 and management - a team and management that brought joy and***

***honour to every man, woman and child to the City, County and beyond. I am being asked***

***this on a regular basis by my constituents.***

**REPLY:**

A Civic Reception to celebrate the Limerick Senior Hurling Team’s three All-

Ireland titles in four years, including back-to-back victories in 2020 and 2021,

which was scheduled for 26th November 2021, had to be cancelled at short

notice due to the high level of COVID cases in Ireland around the time of that

proposed Civic Reception.

To celebrate their back-to-back All-Ireland senior hurling titles, members of

the Limerick Senior Hurling Panel were this year’s Grand Marshal at the

Limerick St. Patrick’s Day parade. They were joined by the Liam MacCarthy

Cup as they led a 250-strong procession from Limerick GAA. An estimated

50,000 people lined the streets to celebrate.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed outline of the current plans to tackle derelict***

***houses in Limerick that are Council-owned in areas such as Kennedy Park and Hyde Road***

***and Lenihan Avenue, Prospect. These areas have many derelict Council-owned properties***

***and the Council is in the process of acquiring more properties through Compulsory Purchase***

***Order. The Council needs to refurbish these properties so they can be allocated as soon as***

***possible.***

**REPLY:**

14 derelict Council-owned properties have been identified in Hyde Road, Hyde

Avenue, Lenihan Avenue, Hyde Villas and Ballyclough Avenue for transfer to

the AHB sector for refurbishment and allocation.

Involving the AHB (Approved Housing Body) Sector will assist the Council in

tackling the substantial backlog of derelict properties (Category 3 and 4) within

the Council’s responsibility. It is expected that these properties will be

completed and ready for allocation within a 9-10 month timeframe.
---
18

In addition to the above, the Housing Construction and Maintenance Section

also arrange for works to be undertaken directly to derelict housing units so as

to provide homes for tenancy.

The approach is that units are grouped into Lots. Each dwelling within the Lot

is then scoped to identify the extent and nature of work that is required to be

completed. Once this is done, the tender documents are prepared and the Lot

is advertised through the public tender process.

Depending upon the specific proposals, some of these properties can require

planning consent before they can be undertaken. Once a contractor is

appointed, the construction period will typically take 8-10 months, depending

upon the number of units and extent of work to be undertaken.

The specific number of units is as follows:

Kennedy Park

4 Units

Hyde Road

7 Units

Lenihan Avenue

3 Units

-

o Of the 4 units in Kennedy Park, 1 unit is in Lot 2, 2 units are in Lot 3 and the

other unit is a recent addition.

o Of the 7 units on Hyde Road, 3 units are in one group and an individual Capital

Appraisal is being prepared, 1 unit is in Lot 2 and the other unit is a recent

addition.

o Of the 3 units in Lenihan Avenue, 1 unit is in Lot 2 and 2 units are in Lot 4.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

***I will ask at the next Meeting what is the protocol of flying flags adjacent to our National***

***Flag.***

**REPLY:**

Article 7 of the Constitution states “The national flag is the tricolour of green,

white and orange.” The Department of the Taoiseach has general

responsibility in relation to the National Flag and is responsible for the

guidelines for the flying of the Flag. Section 6 of the Guidelines states: (i) When

the National Flag is flown with the flags of other nations, each flag should have

the same width and should fly from a separate flagpole of the same height; (ii)

When the National Flag is flown at a building or entrance along with other flags

of equal height, it should be first on the right (on an observer’s left).

12.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many families, including children, are currently housed***

***in Thomond Student Village.***
---
19

**REPLY:**

There are 12 families with children currently residing in Thomond Village.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

***I will ask at the next Meeting what progress has been made in acquiring the funding to***

***restore and reopen the Black Bridge in Plassey given its vital link to Co. Clare, and when will***

***work commence on the structure.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is working in partnership with Clare County

Council, ESB and Waterways Ireland to explore the potential of developing a

Greenway between Limerick and Scarriff. This scheme is at the early phase of

development and is scheduled for public consultation in April / May 2022. The

restoration and use of the Black Bridge to connect the existing

walkway/cycleway on the Limerick side of the River Shannon to a new

potential route north of the Shannon will be considered as part of the scheme’s

development. As the project is at early development stage, we are not in a

position to provide delivery dates for any element of the scheme.

Note that the funding and delivery of Greenways was transferred from the

Department of Transport to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in September

2021.  All Greenway schemes will be subject to the relevant TII guidance and

approval processes. TII have made an allocation of €70,000 to Clare County

Council in 2021 towards the ongoing development of the Limerick to Scarriff

scheme.

responded to the major and unheralded challenges associated with the

pandemic. It is important to note that there has been an excellent working

relationship between the principal response agencies throughout the

pandemic as part of the ‘whole of government approach’ at the local and

regional level.

The issue of ambulances is currently being discussed at national level between

the Health Service Executive and the National Directorate for Fire and

Emergency Management under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage. Pending progress at a national level, the Limerick

Fire and Emergency Service will have to await guidance from the National

Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in terms of this issue and

cannot progress this matter until the national discussions have concluded.

We are currently engaged in a procurement process for the appointment of

an Urban Design and Planning Agency who will be preparing a Limerick Public

Realm Strategy for Limerick City. This important work will initiate a series of

public consultations in order to engage all views on various issues and plans

for the future of Limerick’s Public Realm. The public consultations will include

but not be limited to the following:

 Review how citizens would change public spaces in order to facilitate safer

and more positive environments;

 Review how citizens currently see and use Limerick’s public realm and how

they wish to use the public realm going forward;

 Review of lighting to facilitate safer access and improve the night-time

ambience and economy;

 Consultation on street clutter and ‘improving access for all.’

On foot of the public consultations, an Urban Design Analysis and

Characterisation Study will be prepared as part of the Strategy that

encapsulates learnings from the process.

The consultation process will be inclusive and a communication programme

will be in place that encourages effective participation in the preparation and

delivery of the Strategy with all members of the public and key stakeholders.

The public consultations will take multiple formats, but one of these will

include a ‘walking workshop’ session and ask members of the community to

photograph and record features to understand the aspects of local character

that people value and those that they would like to change.

In relation to the Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas, we will include

elements to look specifically at safety for women and we will explore options

on how to achieve best practice on it and engage with relevant groups.

our public spaces a safer and universally friendlier environment.

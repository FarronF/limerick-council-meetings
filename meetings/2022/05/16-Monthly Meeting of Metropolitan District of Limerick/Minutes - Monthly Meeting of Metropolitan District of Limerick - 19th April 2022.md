**QUESTIONS**

**4.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***procurement process for the removal of graffiti and that the railway bridge over the Park Canal***

***linking Lower Park and Rhebogue be included in the tender.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Cleansing Department has a team and contractor

currently in place to address any graffiti items throughout the Limerick Metropolitan area.

A tender has been raised to appoint a graffiti removal specialist to address graffiti call-outs

within a specific time period and it is envisaged that the winning contractor will be

appointed in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, the railway bridge over the Park Canal

linking Lower Park and Rhebogue cannot be added to this tender as this structure is under

the ownership and maintenance of Irish Rail.

**5.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***detailed design, tendering and commencement of the Part 8 Active Travel Scheme on the Mill***

***Road in Corbally.***

**REPLY**: Limerick Active Travel anticipates the appointment of a Consultant for Detailed Design in

Q2 2022. It is intended to carry out a tendering process in Q3/4 and it is hoped that

construction would commence in Q4 2022.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a breakdown of the***

***amount collected in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 from Fire Brigade callout charges in Limerick.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council Fire Authority collected the following amounts:

2019 -

€969,071.88

2020 -

€749,199.90

2021 -

€899,709.25

**7.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick why was the only green***

***area that was zoned open space at Hillcroft Close, St. Patricks Road, zoned to residential in the***

***Development Plan.   Two local schools made submissions to the Development Plan but nothing***

***was mentioned regarding the green space at Hillcroft in their submissions. So why then was it***

***decided that this space that provides recreational and an outdoor area for a cul de sac be zoned***

***residential.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council in the preparation of the Draft Limerick Development Plan

2022 – 2028 reviewed and examined all lands through the City and Environs and carried

out extensive consultation to inform the preparation of the Draft Zoning Map for the area.

In order to comply with national and regional planning policy in terms of achieving compact

growth, numerous sites were rezoned to deliver residential development and meet the

target identified for Limerick. The Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022 – 2028 was made

by the Elected Members of Limerick City and County Council, which included this site, at a

series of Council Meetings in June 2021.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick at what stage is the design***

***plan for the Roundabout at Rosmor that is to provide a turning point for the bus.***

**REPLY:** Active Travel is working with consultants and the NTA to progress Rosmor Roundabout and

would anticipate drawings to be concluded in Q2 2022.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that, following my Notice***

***of Motion in 2021, which was unanimously supported about providing a bus service for Flanker***

***Court, did the Council write to the NTA and Bus Eireann regarding this matter?  If so what was***

***the response and if not, can they do so as soon as possible.***

**REPLY:** We previously made contact with Bus Éireann and the NTA in relation to this matter and

are still awaiting a response. We will issue a further reminder to them on this matter.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what is the timeframe for***

***completion of site clearance at Opera Site, what buildings have planning permission to enable***

***construction and what is the timeframe for completion.***

**REPLY:** The Opera Demolition and Enabling works are approximately 90% complete, the remaining

elements are focused on the difficult technical elements surrounding the Georgian Buildings

on Rutland Street. The Demolition and Enabling works will be August, as there was a four-

month delay with forced site closures nationally  due to Covid-19 in early 2021.

To maintain momentum of the construction programme, the tenders for the sitewide

basement works, and for the construction of One Opera Square are well advanced and due

to commence in August 2022. One Opera Square is a Grade A office which will have capacity

to accommodate up to 1,000 workers. The design is to a world class standard, incorporating

the environmental accreditation LEED Platinum, and wellness accreditation, WELL Platinum.

Letting Agents Cushman & Wakefield have been appointed as letting agents to market the

property both nationally and internationally in advance and during construction.

An electronic brochure of One Opera Square was circulated as part of the response.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what are the next steps in***

***the process to complete master plan for the Limerick 2030 Cleeves site and what is the timeframe***

***for completing this master plan.***
---
10

**REPLY**: There has been a lot of excellent work done in the preparation of the delivery of the Cleeves

Riverside Quarter Site. Councillors will be aware that the site received €34.5 m in funding

under the latest Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF) application last year as part

of the World-Class Waterfront. To obtain this funding a very detailed Preliminary Business

Case for the site was completed and issued to the Department in February 2022, a major

piece of work which is required under the Public Spending Code. It involves a very detailed

analysis and option appraisals of the site, a financial appraisal, economic assessment,

sensitivity analysis and multi criteria analysis, risks and different design options. This plan

will assist in the delivery options of the site.

Internationally renowned architects Fielden Clegg Bradley and Bucholtz McEvoy were

appointed as the design team for the scheme. The LTT Executive are currently in market

discussions with potential investors / developers on funding and delivery options for the

site and a funding delivery plan will be completed shortly. This 10-acre site will require

substantial market investment along with the URDF funding for its delivery as a key strategic

site for Limerick, which will cater for residential, commercial, community and cultural zones,

in addition to a large new public realm space.

The public consultation stage, and completion of the masterplan will be undertaken in Q3

and Q4 of this year, with a submission of planning targeted for 2023.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a report on energy***

***efficiency among the Council's housing stock, including breakdown by BER rating and 2022-2023***

***plans for energy retrofitting.***

**REPLY:**All housing units delivered as part of the energy retrofit scheme in the last two years

required the properties to achieve a minimum B2 energy rating to ensure grant funding was

secured. This was achieved in all cases with some instances where the B2 rating was

exceeded due to certain house layouts.

Nearly 40% of the housing stock in Limerick City & County Council is over 40 years old with

15% of the stock over 60 years old. Energy ratings for the older houses, where available, are

very low due to their poor thermal state. Replacement of windows and doors, which makes

up a significant part of thermal loss, remains a priority for Housing Maintenance with

significant numbers upgraded annually as part of maintenance programmes.

Properties with low energy ratings have been targeted as part of the energy upgrade works

to date, a good example being Raheen Square in Limerick City where BER rating of F & G

were recorded before the energy works progressed.

Similar properties will be targeted for the 2022 programme, with consideration also given

to the geographical spread of the properties with house grouping also a determining factor

in house selection.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a report on how***
---
11

***procurement works for energy retrofitting works undertaken by the Council and whether there***

***are any plans to take advantage of economies of scale as the Local Authority retrofitting***

***programme expands.***

**REPLY:**As part of the energy upgrade works programmes, Local Authorities are required to engage

with an ‘obligated party’ as identified in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)

website. An obligated party is a supplier or distributor selling more than 600 GWh of energy

per year to its customers. Limerick City & County Council have engaged the services of an

obligated party following a competitive tendering process.

In essence the obligated party acts as a consultant, providing quantity surveying and

specialist design services to identify the works required in order to achieve the B2 energy

rating for each property, in line with available Department funding. Procurement of all

contractors and consultants is completed in compliance with national procurement

guidelines. This includes for all appointments in relation to Health & Safety.

In relation to economies of scale, the model of the scheme, as currently sized and

operated by Limerick City and County Council is at a scale that is both economic and

manageable on an annual basis. While the scheme is not funded on a multi-annual basis,

it has to date returned significant economies of scale and is expected to continue to do so.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the derelict***

***housing estate at Ballyanrahan East, Patrickswell, Co. Limerick.***

**REPLY:** The units at Ballyanrahan East, Patrickswell, were vested in Limerick City and County

Council following compulsory acquisition through the Derelict Sites Act, 1990. The Council

is now the registered owner of folio 73661F Co. Limerick. This folio was partly created from

folio LK 63948F. There is still a lis pendens registered against this folio. The mortgage on

the property was created in 2008 and the proceedings only commenced in 2017. The

existence of the lis pendens must be brought to the attention of any purchaser.

In the opinion of our legal advisor, the property should not be put on the market until after

the lis pendens has been removed or in the alternative the Council, obtain a detailed

explanation from the solicitors for Everyday Finance DAC that satisfies it that the lis

pendens does not interfere with the ability of the Council to put the property on the market.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a pedestrian crossing***

***may be considered for Barrington Street/Pery Square junction to allow students to safely cross***

***to St. Michael’s National School.***

**REPLY**: The location of St Michael’s national school at Pery Square is accessible, without the

necessity for crossing, by pedestrians from the existing Pelican crossing on Upper Mallow

Street and from Barrington Street. There is also a layby at Pery Square for school buses to

park at the same side of school entrance, which also reduces the need of crossing. Limerick
---
12

City and County Council have no current plans to install a pedestrian crossing in this location

but canconsider anupgrade tothe existing school line marking signage in the area.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick does the Active Travel team***

***intend to reinstall secure bike lockers in city centre car parks that were previously installed by***

***Limerick Smarter Travel in 2016.***

**REPLY**: Off-street bike parking is provided in city centre car parks by agreement with landlords of

the car parks. In some locations the landlords did not wish to continue the arrangement

and the bike parking and bike lockers were removed.

Currently, there is off street bike parking facilities available in Q Park Car Park, Henry Street

(off Mount Kenneth Place) and also in Cruises Street Car Park (off Denmark Street).

There are many on street bike parking facilities across the city. Limerick Active Travel is

currently undertaking a review of bike parking facilities across the metropolitan area to

assess current infrastructure and to determine the need for further parking.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick has the Council conducted***

***any analysis of district heating potential, where you use residual heat generated from industry***

***to heat homes and businesses, for Limerick City and other urban areas.***

**REPLY**: Limerick Council has conducted studies for district heating associated with heat recovery

from industrial sources at Irish Cement and at Raheen Industrial Estate. The studies were

not extended to detailed energy analysis or engineering design.

Combined Heat and Power and District Heating was considered using biomass as the

primary fuel in Limerick docks/city and Askeaton leisure centre/nursing home. These

proposals included energy analysis, but not engineering design.

The +CityxChange H2020 EU project examined the feasibility of a district heating loop

within a city block, using gas Combined Heat and Power and heat pumps. The proposal has

an energy analysis, but not engineering design.

Detailed business models were not prepared for any of the proposals.

It is the intention of the Council to examine the potential for district heating as part of the

forthcoming Climate Action Plan.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the LIT/TUS***

***to city centre active travel project.***

**REPLY**: Limerick Active Travel has been liaising with the NTA on updated preliminary design
---
13

drawings. We are now progressing environmental assessments, landscape plans and

preparation of draft planning reports.

Limerick Active Travel anticipates having the required documents for this stage of the

process back with the NTA in June, with a view to commencing the Part 8 process once we

have received approval from the NTA to move to the next stage.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can the Council outline plans***

***to improve the area around Mathew Bridge, Bridge Street and Rutland Street for pedestrians.***

**REPLY**: Pedestrian movements at Matthew bridge, including both Bridge Street and Rutland Street

approaches, form a core part of the city centre Three Bridges Walk and as such are attracting

increasing numbers of pedestrians.  It is accepted that improved footpaths should be

incorporated at the bridge crossing to meet this increasing demand.  Currently the Council

is looking at various options at the bridge, including the widening of existing footpaths  with

loss of some vehicular traffic capacity. Alternatively, the possibility of having a parallel

footbridge/cycleway as a standalone structure/ deck enhancement to existing bridge is

being considered. This study is still at options selection stage, but will advance to a definitive

proposal for pedestrian improvements.

The Council is also working on a separate traffic management plan for the city, which will

look at vehicular and active travel needs in the vicinity of Matthew Bridge, Bridge Street and

Rutland Street. This study, in combination with the finalisation of LSMATS, which identifies

Library Development Plan published June 2021.

An options study will be undertaken this year to identify what sites or buildings are available

to meet the requirements of a new library for the Castletroy / Annacotty community.

The provision of a temporary library for the area would incur significant capital costs in

terms of rent, adaptation costs of a premises, and fit out costs including shelving, furniture,

ICT equipment and book stock. In addition, it would require significant staffing resources.

There is no provision to meet the cost of same at this time.

The Castletroy/Annacotty area is currently being served by a mobile library service.

Following discussions it was agreed to refer the Notice of Motion to the Community, Leisure and

Culture Strategic Policy Committee for further discussion.

**21.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***in place for traffic management in Corbally, Rhebogue and Lower Park given the volume of***

***vehicular traffic and proposed new housing development in the area.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor Novak Uí

Chonchúir and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) highlighted the need for a masterplan for traffic

management, having regard to proposals for new housing developments and a new bridge over the

Canal in this area, and the current lack of adequate public transport.

**REPLY**: A traffic management plan for Limerick City Centre is currently at the early stages of

preparation and will be further developed following the final confirmation of LSMATS,

hopefully later this summer.  It is accepted that the Corbally approach to the city, together

with the Rhebogue and Park Road areas present some of the bigger traffic challenges and

this area will be dealt with in the developing study. A major Priority Bus and Active travel

corridor connection to the city from the Corbally approach is identified in the draft LSMATS,

and the vehicular traffic study underway will need to be cognisant of this requirement. The

study will take into account proposed land use zoning, including proposed housing

developments, in accordance with the new Limerick City and County Development Plan.

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Collins and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted the difficulties experienced by first time

buyers in purchasing properties where they were sometimes competing with investment funds to

purchase a property. The Senior Executive Officer, Housing outlined the reply issued to Members

to the Notice of Motion and explained the process currently involved in the leasing of properties.

There was a general discussion on the issue with Members supporting the motion and they

requested that a Briefing would be organised for Members in relation to Project Ivy.

**REPLY**: All policy and procedures in relation to the leasing programme are set out by the

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) under the Social Housing

Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).

Limerick City and County Council were mandated by the DHLGH to deliver 84 units under

the leasing stream in 2021.

Long-term lease arrangements, including the enhanced lease, of privately owned dwellings

can be entered into by either Local Authorities or Approved Housing Bodies. Under these

arrangements, the Local Authority or Approved Housing Body acts as the landlord to the

tenant. The terms of these agreements are set out in standard template agreements

provided by the DHLGH, which must be used, by all Local Authorities and Approved Housing

Bodies.

An independent market rental valuation for lease agreements is carried out by Limerick City

and County Council prior to signing a lease agreement. This is to ensure value for money

and also to ensure proposals for market rent are not artificially inflating the local rental

market. If there are any disputes on proposed market rents between Limerick City and

County Council and the property owner, the matter is referred to the Housing Agency to

arbitrate and recommend a final market rent that is binding.

Furthermore, the long-term lease agreement is Limerick City and County Council and the

property owner. Proof of ownership is required in order to sign a long-term lease with

Limerick City and County Council. Limerick City and County Council have no involvement in

the sales process of a particular property which may subsequently come to Limerick City

and County Council for a proposed long-term lease.

The leasing arrangements in place to date undertake a rigorous pre-assessment as follows:

• A check against housing need in area for bed type proposed

• An assessment of the level of social-rental in an area to avoid overconcentration of one

type of tenure

• A check to ensure that there is vacant possession

• A check to ensure no first time buyer is bidding. The Housing Directorate seek

confirmation that First Time Buyers are not engaging/bidding on the property. If it is

confirmed that First Time Buyers are bidding, the Housing Directorate will not support the

unit under Long Term Lease.

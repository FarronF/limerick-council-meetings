Limerick City and County Council does not have direct ownership of any

apartment at the River Garden Complex, Killarney Road, Abbeyfeale.

Three of the units within the wider complex are under a Long Term Lease

remains the responsibility of the building owner.

The maintenance of a private property is the responsibility of the property

owner.

Killarney Road, Abbeyfeale and it was agreed that the Director would liaise with the relevant

Directorate on this matter.---

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council reconsider leaving the Mass Path gate open***

***at night time. As this is currently being left open all night this is leading to anti-social***

***behavior and causing a nuisance to the neighbours in the area. Can this be locked at night***

***time and reopened in the mornings.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle referred to the recent opening of the Mass Path

gate at night time and to anti-social behaviour at this location and requested that the opening

times of the Mass Path be reconsidered.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that this matter was discussed at a recent

Meeting of the Joint Policing Committee where the Gardaí noted that no reports of anti-social

behaviour had been highlighted.

Following discussion, the Senior Executive Engineer agreed to liaise with the Gardaí on this

matter. It was also agreed that this Item would be kept on the Agenda for the May Meeting

of the District.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Site Notices be placed on all Council owned property***

***being considered for disposal within our Municipal District.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

The current procedure for selling properties is that a “for sale” sign is placed on the property

and that all properties are advertised online. The Council is satisfied that the existing

procedure is working well and properties are kept on the market for a minimum of 4-6 weeks

and in most cases longer for maximum exposure.

The placing of a sign on the property gives the public an indication that the property is for

sale. Queries can at that stage be raised with Council Officials or the Marketing Agent.

The Property Section is subject to audit and has the necessary safeguards and checks in place

to ensure that all transactions are transparent and accountable. The disposal of property is a

reserved function and a report is prepared for the Members in accordance with Section 183

of the Local Government Act, 2001.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan expressed dissatisfaction at the reply received

and requested that site notices be placed on all Council owned property in advance of

disposal. A discussion followed and in replying the Director stated that it is not appropriate

to change the existing process which is working well.---

Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development and it was agreed that further clarification

would be sought on the funding allocated to date on both these roads. It was also agreed

that this Item remain on the Agenda for the May Meeting of the District.

Repairs to the floor of the bridge crossing the Greenway at Bill Kelly’s next to Devon Road

Station was raised. It was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would seek a further

update on this matter.

It was agreed to hold the May Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 4th May, 2022, at 10.00

a.m., at Áras William Smith OBrien.

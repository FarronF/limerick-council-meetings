QUESTIONS

10.

Question submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that Limerick

City and County Council employ street cleaning operative's as in Bruff/Kilmallock to service

the villages of the municipality e.g. Cappamore /Doon /Murroe /Caherconlish /Pallasgreen

/Oola/ Kilteely etc.

**Reply:**

The Cappamore Kilmallock Road Maintenance team currently carry out a street cleaning

function as part of the overall roads duties in all of the towns and villages in the Municipal

District. The current adopted budget does not allow for additional dedicated street

cleaners.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor Carey

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District, if it is within

the powers of the local authority to issue a Compulsory Purchase Order on the house of a

deceased person, while a legal process or probate, involving the distribution of said

deceased person’s property, is being contested.

**Reply:**

Limerick City and County Council has a focused initiative on bringing derelict and vacant

property in its administrative area back into productive use with a particular emphasis on

areas of high housing demand in the town and village centres of the county and in the city

of Limerick.

This work is guided by key legislation as set out in the Derelict Sites Act 1990, the Housing

Act 1966, and the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, and its implementation is

underpinned by robust processes and operating procedures.

The initiative is informed by proactive dereliction and vacancy surveys completed

throughout the administrative area, representations received from public representatives,

and complaints received from the community. Derelict and vacant properties may also be

reported by the public through www.vacanthomes.ie .

The Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as amended), states it is the duty of every owner and occupier

of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become or does not

continue to be a derelict site. The Act also states that it shall be the duty of a local authority

to take all reasonable steps (including the exercise of any appropriate statutory powers) to

ensure that any land situate in their functional area does not become or continue to be a

derelict site. Any land with particulars entered on the Derelict Site Register may be

considered for compulsory acquisition under the derelict sites legislation whereby section

14 of the Act provides that a local authority may acquire by agreement or compulsorily any

derelict site within their functional area. An application is made to An Bord Pleanála for---
consent to the acquisition, on foot of an objection received from an Owner to a Notice of

Intention to Acquire Compulsorily.

Section 76 (and the Third Schedule) of the Housing Act 1966 prescribe the powers of local

authorities to compulsorily acquire land/building for social housing. A housing authority

acquiring land compulsorily for the purposes of this Act may be authorised to do so by

means of a compulsory purchase order made by the authority and submitted to and

confirmed by An Bord Pleanála.

Both pieces of legislation define “Owner” as a person, other than a mortgagee not in

possession, who is for the time being entitled to dispose of the freehold of the land. It also

includes any person in possession or reversion and any person holding or entitled to the

rents and profits of the land under a lease or agreement where the unexpired term exceeds

three years.

Any statutory notices required to be given or served on a person under The Derelict Sites

Act 1990 or the Housing Act 1966 shall be addressed to the owner or the occupier (as the

case may be). Where the owner cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, a notice may

be addressed to “The Owner” or “The Occupier” (as the case may require) without naming

them.

There are active cases whereby the landowner may be identified as “the Legal Personal

Representative” or “Executor/Executrix” or “Administrator” of the estate of a deceased

person and they also have certain legal powers vested in them to engage with the Council in

respect of matters relating to derelict and vacant property in their control.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that a

programme be put in place to open the gully's and inlets on all the regional and local roads

in the area. Great work has been done on the roads and on the various drainage schemes

carried out but the ongoing maintenance is needed.

**Reply:**

The Cappamore Kilmallock MD Roads Staff are currently compiling a new drainage

maintenance programme for 2022/2023 for cleaning inlets and gullies.

***The Questions were taken as read.***---

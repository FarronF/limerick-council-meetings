District from 2021 and 2022 to date.

The presentation covered the Schedules of Municipal District works for 2021 and 2022,

and was delivered by the Senior Executive Engineer for the Cappamore Kilmallock

Municipal District.

The Elected Members thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for the presentation and

5.Notices of Motion regarding Wolfe Tone St Apartments

The Senior Executive Engineer outlined that the site of the Wolfe Tone St Apartments in

Kilmallock had been acquired through the Derelict Sites act. The current state of the

building was assessed by Malachy Walsh and Partners in March 2021 and demolition was

recommended.

It was also noted that, following the National CFRAM Flood Study, this site is located in a

Flood Zone A location.

It was noted that the Original planning permission would no longer apply.
---
A portion of the Malachy Walsh report was read to the Elected Members, and it was noted

that this was available for the Elected Members to view at any time by contacting the Senior

Executive Engineer. This noted that the building was in an unfinished state and could not be

retained or reused under building regulations, therefore the proposed recommendation

from the structural engineers report was demolition of the existing structure as soon as

possible.

Clarification was sought as to whether the actions agreed at the May Municipal District

Meeting were undertaken, and it was noted that following conversations between the

Director of Services for Community, Tourism and Culture and the relevant Elected Members

involved, all parties were satisfied that these actions were followed.

A question was raised as to whether a residential property could be demolished after 7

years. Clarification on this will be sought, and clarification as to whether it could be

considered a residential property will be sought as it had never functioned as such.

Councillor Donegan noted that a Part 8 is currently being prepared in support of a Grant

application for redevelopment of the park and surrounding areas, and was concerned that

the current uncertainty of not following his September 2021 Notice of Motion would

jeopardise the grant application.

A query was raised as to how the Standing Orders applied to the current Notice of Motion

submitted by Councillor Carey.

As per the Standing Orders, the options available are to approve or dispose of this Notice of

Motion, and deferral for a second time cannot be considered.

It was agreed that Councillor Carey would dispose of the Notice of Motion, and

consideration be given to submitting the Notice of Motion again with signatures of 3 Elected

Members at a future date.

It was agreed that the Senior Executive Engineer would speak with the Directors of Service

for Transport and Infrastructure (with responsibility for the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal

District) and Community, Tourism and Culture to identify the next steps prior to the next

meeting, which would include a sit down meeting with the relevant representatives of the

Executive and Elected Members before the July Municipal District Meeting.

**Extension of Meeting**

It was noted at this stage that the Annual General Meeting was due to start at 4.30pm

and that there were remaining items on the Agenda to be discussed. It was proposed

and agreed to extend the time of the June Municipal District Meeting and delay the start

There is an existing pedestrian crossing on the R513 adjacent to the National School.

Another pedestrian crossing is due to be installed at the junction of main street and the

The Mayor thanked everybody for attending the Special Meeting, explaining that it was being

held in order to pass a Vote of Sympathy for former Member and former Cathaoirleach of

Limerick County Council, Mary Jackman, who had sadly passed away. Deep sympathy was

expressed to her husband Nicholas, daughter Nicola, sister Ursula, and to her friends,

neighbours and community, for their loss.

The Mayor went on to state that Mary was a very warm engaging person who was highly

regarded by all. She was a very active woman and always willing to offer her support and

guidance. The Mayor recalled her very successful political career and describe her as a great

advocate for Women in Politics. Mary was first elected to Limerick County Council in 1985,

and topped the poll at the 2004 and 2009 local elections. During that time, she also served

two terms in the Seanad, between 1989 and 1993, and 1997 and 2002. She was one of the

longest serving councillors for the local authority when she retired in 2014, after almost 30

years of service. She was elected as Cathaoirleach of Limerick County Council in 1999, and at

the time, was the first female Cathaoirleach of the County. He added that she was always full

of life and full of energy, stating that she remained very active within her own community

after her political career was over.

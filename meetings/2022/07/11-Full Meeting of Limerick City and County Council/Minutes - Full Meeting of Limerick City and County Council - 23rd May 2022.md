QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donegan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update regarding monitoring, maintenance and GDPR**

**of CCTV in Limerick City and County by Limerick City and County Council.**

**REPLY:**

The Head of Digital Services has conducted a full and robust review of

Limerick’s Community CCTV cameras to determine the necessity, the

proportionality and the justification of each camera in the Community CCTV

schemes.

353 cameras met the conditions of necessity, proportionality and justification

and were subsequently divided into 4 Community CCTV Schemes (Northside,

Southside, Canal and Riverbank and Hinterland) with Community CCTV

Scheme applications prepared and submitted to the Garda Commissioner

under Section 38 of An Garda Síochána Act 2005 for approval. Only the

Northside and Southside schemes are to be live monitored at present.

Additional signage has been erected for each camera in the schemes along

with signs demarcating the entrance to locations where Community CCTV

schemes exist. CCTV maintenance for all Community CCTV cameras is ongoing.

Approximately 60 cameras were decommissioned and removed as a result of

the review process. All traffic management cameras were decommissioned

since no legal basis currently exists for their operation. National legislation is

being prepared that will address this particular traffic management situation.---
Locations of all cameras can be found at:

https://www.limerick.ie/council/services/your-council/digital-

services/limerick-city-and-county-council-cctv-policy-cctv

Limerick City and County Council is currently awaiting the approval from the

Strategy and build a CCTV function to take care of the operations of

Community CCTV and be prepared for upcoming legislation that supports the

use of CCTV.

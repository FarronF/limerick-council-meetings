***overtime expended by our staff on repairs and maintenance works.***

REPLY:

This Question was referred to Irish Water (Reference No: 49687).

Irish Water issued the following reply, following on from a Special Municipal District Meeting

held on Wednesday, 25th May to discuss water supply issues in the Broadford and

Dromcollogher areas.

The 6” diameter watermain along the R515 from Dromcollogher extending west through

Broadford to Mountplummer has experienced a high number of bursts in the last 6 weeks.

This main had a history of up to 4 bursts per annum in recent years but this rate has increased

rapidly in recent months. These bursts have been exacerbated by often occurring in pairs one

after another that have made the outages for repairs more extended than usual. This has

required water tankers to be placed in Broadford for local use on two recent occasions. The

feedback received on the need to improve communications to the elected representatives in

the event of any further bursts is noted.

As an interim measure, Irish Water with its partners Limerick City and County Council, have

reduced the pressure in the watermains from approximately 3 bar to 1 bar to reduce the

stress on this fragile watermain. We have not received any complaints to date regrading low

pressure and will review this on an ongoing basis should they arise. Similarly, where possible,
---

flows have been routed from the Dromcollogher direction to reduce the reliance upon this

watermain.

This length of watermain is over 6km in length and would require capital investment of over

€500,000 to replace which is significant expenditure from our available budgets. Irish Water

has received quotations from Contractors for addressing the worst affected lengths and

subject to availability and materials are committed to replacing an initial 1 to 1.5km length to

the west of Broadford. Irish Water will confirm shortly to the Municipal District the start date

for these works and a timeline. The replacement main is to be laid in lengths in parallel to the

existing main with customers transferred across after being completed to reduce disruption

to supplies. Communications on this will be issued in advance to the Municipal District before

any public release. The remaining lengths have been sent forward for detailed design and

funding approval to allow it to advance to construction.

Irish Water appreciates the opportunity afforded to give a briefing on this and to gain an

understanding of the impact on this local community.

Councillor Scanlan made reference to the number of bursts in the water main and to the

disruption caused to members of the public as a result. He wished to seek a response to Part

C of the Question with regard to the number of hours inclusive of overtime expended by staff

on repairs and maintenance works on the water main. It was agreed that the Meetings

Administrator would follow up on this matter with the relevant Directorate.

The poor condition and reinstatement of the roads following repairs to burst water mains in

the District was raised. Following discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Sheahan,

seconded by Councillor Galvin and agreed by all the Members present that a Notice of Motion

requesting when Irish Water applies for a Road Opening Licence to Limerick City and County

Council that Irish Water be asked to pay a bond that will cover the cost of full reinstatement

of the road, within a short period of time to be determined. It was agreed that the Meetings

Administrator would forward this Motion to the Corporate Services Section for inclusion on

the Agenda of the next Full Council Meeting.

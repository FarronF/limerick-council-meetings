***are scheduled for redevelopment in the next twelve months.***

West Area.

Of these, 28 are being returned by the Housing Maintenance section and all are scheduled

The average time for return of these dwellings varies with the extent of work to be

undertaken, in general 12 to 15 weeks is taken to complete a dwelling from commencement

of the works.

There are 14 units being returned by Housing Construction. These refer to dwellings that

require more extensive works and are being returned through tendered Lots, of these:

**REPLY:** The Domestic Waste & Litter Team manage three dog bins located at Dooradoyle Road,

Church Road, Raheen and Father Russell Road. Each bin is serviced weekly by an authorised

waste collector.

Cost and design options for any new bins would form part of a procurement process.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick Council will***

***very successful for this area last summer.***

**REPLY**: The lane closure for Back Lane located to rear of the Mother Macs public house on High

Street was reviewed and inspected by the Limerick City and County Council Roads

Department when this lane closure expired in April 2022. Upon inspection it appeared that

the use of this lane, which was closed daily between the hours of 11am and midnight, was

not been fully utilised for outdoor dining experience from 11am. Bearing this factor in mind

along with the increased activity of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists that has returned in

the city centre following the Covid 19 pandemic, this lane closure was extended with the

closure time reduced to the hours of 6pm to midnight to encompass the traffic

requirements of the vicinity and to accommodate the needs of the other surrounding

businesses in the area.

This lane closure will be further reviewed at the end of its current expiry period in

November 2022.

Dock Road for landfill or incineration.

***appointed yet**to prepare the design for the extension to the Castleconnell playground.***

€20,000.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

We will continue to explore all avenues to identify a suitable site for a burial ground in the

Castletroy area.

Lane in the Abbey Area have recently been delivered.

Consultation with the homeowners in the locality is due to begin shortly and signage will

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***capacity audit for Loughmore Canal.***

**REPLY**: RPS consultants have been carrying out surveys as part of development of a flood relief

scheme for Limerick City & Environs of which the Barnakyle River is a part of the study area.

Once data is collated and analysed, RPS will provide a recommendation as to whether the

Loughmore Canal and surrounding area will be included as part of the scheme for further

consideration. This may include a hydraulic assessment and other studies as required of the

capacity of the Loughmore Canal and other areas potentially at risk of flooding within the

scheme area.

JBA Consultants are currently developing a Stormwater Management Plan for Limerick,

which will include an analysis of the capacity of the Loughmore Canal. This remains a work

in progress.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor T. Collopy**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, what plans do the Council***

***have for St. Anne’s Court and if they could provide an update on any developments.***

**REPLY:** The Council is investigating the possibility for developing the site for affordable and social

homes. The Limerick City and County Council team have designed a feasibility study for

social and affordable homes on the site, making allowance for the initial exciting

archaeological finds. There is a focus on the integration of the City wall in the design of the

public space, and also a vision of bringing the City moat, the “Fosse” into the scheme as a

sustainable blue/green park element.

The most recent test trenching took place when the 20th century houses in St Ann’s Court

were demolished and the site was secured. The city wall extends across the site just below

ground level. It is up to 2m wide and there is a height of at least 2m surviving below ground

level. No testing was carried out in the street at that time but this will be necessary in the

preparation of any part 8 planning for the site to determine the exact extent of the walls

and possible location of the Little Island Gate and to fully integrate them into any scheme

design.

The National Development Finance agency have assisted in preparing a viability report

which is being reviewed in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government

and Heritage’s Affordable housing team to ascertain if the scheme would benefit from

transferring to the higher level of subsidy under the Affordable Housing Fund stream, and

which model of finance/ and development strategy is most suitable. Once outline viability---
7

has been confirmed, the sketch scheme will be presented to councillors for input and

review, and subsequently developed to a part 8 planning application.

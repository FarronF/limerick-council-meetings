**1.Adoption of Minutes**

Circulated, copy of draft Minutes of the Monthly Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick

held on 21st February, 2022.

Proposed by Councillor Collins;

Seconded by Councillor Costelloe;

And Resolved:

“That the draft Minutes, as circulated, be taken as read and adopted and signed.

**2.Disposal of Land**

(a) Circulated, report of the A/Senior Executive Officer, Housing Support Services dated 18th

February, 2022 setting out proposals to dispose of Freehold Interest of premises consisting of a

dwelling house situate at 17 Colbert Avenue, Janesboro, Limerick and the intention to bring a

Section 183 Notice to Full Council in this regard, for approval.

The report, as circulated, was noted by Members.

(b) Circulated, report of the Head of Property and Community Facilities dated 2nd February, 2022

setting out proposals to dispose of the Former Garda Station, Mary Street, Limerick and the

intention to bring a Section 183 Notice to Full Council in this regard, for approval.

Some Members expressed concerns in relation to this proposed disposal, highlighting that the

property was in an important tourist location and the importance of it being utilised outside of

normal office hours if possible, given its location and the tourism objectives for the area. They also

queried what objectives had been met in relation to the Expression of Interest document that had

been issued as part of the disposal process, and what options had been considered for the use of---
2

the building.

The Administrative Officer, Property and Community Facilities confirmed that several Expressions

of Interest had been received, but that concrete funding proposals were not included in most of

the Expressions of Interests received. She also confirmed that as the building was a protected

structure, that it would be a costly process to refurbish the building to return it back to a satisfactory

condition. She explained that this was the reason it was so difficult to get a purchaser who could

meet all the suggested criteria. She also confirmed that other properties for disposal in the area

would be coming before the Members in due course, which might meet more of the particular

tourism objectives being sought by some Members.

The Director, Regeneration also confirmed that regeneration funding was not available and that a

community centre was not being considered for this location. Some Members also noted that the

building had been derelict for over 30 years and was in a tourist area, and that it was important to

try and get it restored and back into use, rather than leave it derelict for a further period of time.

3.

**Planning, Environment and Place-Making Directorate**

**Strategic Housing Development (SHD) Application to An Bord Pleanála at Clonmacken Gardens,**

**Condell Road, Limerick**

The Senior Planner gave a presentation to the Members on the proposed Strategic Housing

Development (SHD) Application and briefed the Members on the content of the proposed

application.

She confirmed that the development would consist of 165 no. residential units, on a site

approximately 4.55ha in size. The breakdown of the units included 43 no. houses (42 no. 3-bed

units and 1 no. 2 -bed bungalow), 42 no. duplex units (21 no. 2-bed ground floor units, 13 no. 3-

bed upper floor units, 8 no. 1-bed upper floor units, along with 80 no. apartment units (17 no. 1-

bed units, 61 no. 2-bed units and 2 no. 3-bed units).

The SHD also included proposals for the development of a crèche facility (438 sq. m), the

provision of shared communal and private open space, car and bicycle parking, site landscaping,

site services, vehicular and pedestrian access to Condell Road via the residential development

under-construction adjacent to the development site.

Members welcomed the development and the additional housing units being proposed. They also

stressed the importance of adequate pedestrian and cycling infrastructure being provided for this

development and the new housing development adjoining the SHD location.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many houses in St.***

***M**ary’s Park*** ***have achieved the BER rating certificate.***

**REPLY**: 157 no. houses in St Mary’s Park have been thermally upgraded to date under the

Regeneration Thermal Upgrade programme. Of these properties, BER certificates have

been attained for and issued to 120 no. properties. Access has yet to be arranged to the 37

residual properties. Of the 120 no. properties that have received a BER certificate, all bar 9

properties have achieved a C grade BER or better rating. C grade BER ratings were not

achieved in properties that refused a gas central heating system.

completed. Of those 90 no. properties, construction works are currently ongoing on 39 no.

properties under thermal upgrade contract no.’s 122 and 124. Works on one of those

contracts is currently nearing substantial completion while works on the second contract is

expected to complete in August / September 2022. The remaining 51 no. properties are

8.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for details on the***

***consultation that has taken place to date with residents regarding Safe Routes to Schools at the***

***Model School, Limerick School Project and St. Pauls National School.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council, in conjunction with the Green-Schools Safe Routes to

School team, are currently preparing draft proposals for the Round 1 Safe Routes to School.

These proposals are being prepared in consultation with each of the schools. When these

draft designs are finalised it is proposed to consult with local stakeholders, including

representatives from residents associations and parent’s council, and other groups where

applicable.

A key element of the Safe Routes to School programme is developing community support

for Safe Routes to School measures, and each of the schools involved will act as a local

champion for the proposed measures to ensure community buy-in for the proposals. The

local authority and Green-Schools Safe Routes to School team will lead in the community

engagement.

Following public consultation the proposals for each school will be finalised and it is

envisioned that these projects would go to construction during the summer holiday

months.

9.

**Question submitted by** **Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick Council will***

***consider increasing the maintenance of open spaces in housing development grants in line with***

***the increasing cost of*** ***private contractors for landscaping services.***

**REPLY**: In general, it is acknowledged that the cost of maintaining open spaces has increased

considerably over the years since this scheme was put in place. The idea behind this

scheme is to assist residents in the maintenance of open spaces in their estates by providing

funding towards grass cutting.

While there is merit in this proposal, the likely cost is beyond the available budget and a

source of funding would need to be identified. The Council will consider increasing the

amount of grant each applicant receives in 2022 subject to resources available to meet the

demand.

10.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**---
5

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, what is the average waiting***

***time, from time of application to approval, for disabled persons grant, mobility aid grant,***

***housing aid for older people grant and housing adaptation grant for people with disabilities and***

***what is the average waiting time for OT inspections, arranged through the Council for the***

***purpose of these grants, where requested by applicants.***

**REPLY**: The current turnaround time for the following grants, Mobility Aid Grant, Housing Aid for

Older People and Housing Adaptation Grant is 8-10 weeks from application to inspection

and approval.

We are seeing delays in relation to final payment as contractors are delayed with supplies

and completing the work, which in turn delays the Council releasing the final payment.

OT inspections are currently arranged as required and are undertaken within two weeks.

Disabled Persons Grants cover works in relation to Local Authority Housing and would be

subject to similar timelines as above. Disabled Persons Extensions may have a longer

timeline as the Council need to investigate that there is no alternative option available other

than an extension.

11.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I am aware that an active travel needs assessment of the Condell Road is currently being***

***tendered. I will ask at the next meeting for a timeline for this process and expected completion***

***date for assessment and subsequent works, which will include a footpath from the new housing***

***development at Moineir to the Clonmacken roundabout and more specifically, how long will it***

***be before this footpath is installed.***

**REPLY**: The Needs Assessment and Options Report that will be provided by the successful tenderer

will require approval by the NTA before funding is allocated to it. Should approval be

received, it is likely that a Statutory Procedure (Part VIII/Section 38) will be required prior

to construction.

It is not possible to give a date for construction at this stage.

12.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, as part of the***

***implementation of the draft LSMATS, if the Council will commit to liaise with the NTA, to prioritise***

***bus service enhancement on the Condell Road, to serve the new and proposed housing***

***developments, as well as Coonagh and the expansion of the TUS Campus at Coonagh Cross.***

**REPLY**: The current Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) draft

document does not deal with detailed operational issues such as specific bus service

scheduling or timetabling.

The Council has been liaising with Bus Éireann locally and the NTA, as service contract

provider, who are carrying out a review of Limerick City operations, which may include this

route. The Council will make direct representation to the NTA regarding the matter raised.

13.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**---
6

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on plans for***

***delivery of the St. Mary's Park Community Centre.***

**REPLY**: At the November 2021 St. Mary’s Park Regeneration Committee meeting the Regeneration

Department, LCCC, provided a synopsis of a 2015 St. Mary’s Park Community Centre funding

proposal submitted to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government

based on a €2.5M project line item within the Limerick Regeneration Framework

Implementation Plan. It was agreed a Working Group would be formed in order to establish

a Definitive Project Brief and progress a funding submission for a 2022 St. Marys Park

Community Centre bearing in mind the Departments concerns of a need to address

catchment area, possible risk of underutilisation, cost and if the condition of the existing

building allows for incorporation into any future proposal. The Working Group consists of:

 3 no. persons from Limerick Island Community Partners

 3 no. persons from St. Marys Park Regeneration Committee

 2 no. persons from the Regeneration Department, LCCC

The Working Groups 1st meeting was held in January 2022. It is to meet on the 3rd Thursday

of every month and it is currently in the process of establishing provision requirements of a

St. Mary’s Park Community Centre. The Regeneration Department, Limerick City and County

Council are in the process of procuring a condition survey for the existing Community

Centre.

14.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a full report on how***

***the Limerick Regeneration Programme funds of EUR337 million committed were spent*** ***as***

***announced by the then Taoiseach Mr. Brian Cowan, June 19th 2010.***

**REPLY**: The Limerick Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP), was launched in September 2013

and adopted by the Council in February 2014.

As adopted by the members of the Council, and sanctioned by the Department of Housing,

Local Government and Heritage, the high-level cost originally attached to the

implementation of Limerick Regeneration Framework in 2013 was €293m with €253m being

earmarked for physical projects and €40m being set aside for social and economic supports.

As of end of December 2021, approximately €181,217,209 had been expended on physical

projects with €30,614,647 on social and economic supports.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

15.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick write to the Minister***

***for Housing, Planning and Local Government to ask if any progress has been made on introducing***

***comprehensive legislation on the operation of current and future retirement villages, as already***

***exists in many other jurisdictions and call on the Minister to make a statement on the matter.***---
7

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Hartigan and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the difficulties experienced by residents and

the need to introduce legislation to provide a regulatory framework to ensure best practice

standards in retirement villages.

16.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir (to be referred to the**

**Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council establish a multidisciplinary suburban rail task force for Limerick, with a purpose***

***to engage with the relevant stakeholders and agencies to develop a suburban rail strategy for***

***Limerick and establish a channel of communication between the local authority, Iarnród Éireann,***

***OPR and other relevant agencies.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

17.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir (to be referred to the**

**Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council prepare a feasibility study on developing a programme of rates reduction and/or***

***other financial compensation for traders based on streets that could be considered for trial or***

***permanent pedestrianisation (in cases where traders would be negatively affected by the new***

***measures).***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning

Strategic Policy Committee.

18.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council carry out***

***a capacity audit of Loughmore Canal and also examine the possibility of installing bunding***

***around the culvert pipe at the canal.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson and seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Benson highlighted issues relating to discharges and flooding

experienced by landowners adjoining Loughmore Canal, which had been happening on a regular

basis according to reports from local landowners who had been in contact with individual

Members, and landowners believed that this issue was linked to the adjoining Raheen Business

Park area.

Whilst Members noted the importance of Raheen Business Park for business and employment,

they supported the Motion and expressed concern at the potential impact of pollutants on---
8

livestock and plant life in the area. Following discussion by the Members, it was proposed by

Councillor Hartigan to amend the Motion as follows:

“I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council carry out

a capacity audit of Loughmore Canal and work with relevant authorities such as Irish Water, EPA,

National Parks & Wildlife Service, Local Authorities Water Programme, Inland Fisheries and the

Industrial Development Authority to identify problems with discharge to Loughmore Canal and

resolve the issue in a timely manner”.

This was agreed.

It was also agreed that a Briefing for Members should be organised for Members and an update

be provided in relation to the issues involved.

**REPLY**: Monitoring works are currently ongoing at the Loughmore Canal.  We have undertaken

weekly sampling at three locations since the 1st February 2022, and this is programmed to

continue for a further 2 weeks.

Following examination of all sampling results and our ongoing inspections, we will review

the requirement of a capacity audit at this location.

With regard to your suggestion of installing a bund, unfortunately this is not presently

considered a viable option.  This would prevent the storm water from entering the canal,

which will cause it to back up in the drainage network leading to potential flooding onto the

public road.  We will continue to investigate and review all practicable solutions, which may

be required at this location.

19.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we examine the***

***possibility of having a temporary library for the Castletroy/Annacotty community until a***

***permanent solution is found for the provision of a library for the area.***

As Cllr Kiely was not in attendance at the Meeting, it was agreed to defer this Notice of Motion to

the April Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick.

This concluded the Meeting.

raised by me.

Questions submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update when the trees and overgrowth in the

Church) be fixed and put in working order again.

| will ask at the next Meeting can a footpath be considered for Kilmeedy from

Newcastle West District/Municipality through the duration of our current County
Development Plan.

| will ask at the next Meeting (a) how much of the loan allocated to Lazy Bikes for
our Greenway project has been drawn down, (b) when were these borrowings availed
of, (c) how muny bicycles do Lazy Bikes currently have on our Greenway, (d) where
are these bikes provided from, and (e) who is in control and where or how can contact

NOTICES OF MOTION
Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin
| will move at the next Meeting that the Council replace the boundary fence dividing

Joe Flynn’s property and Maple Court estate, Abbeyfeale be replaced with a
permanent fence.

1 will move at the next Municipal Meeting that the Council give a facelift to the
apartments on the Killarney road, Abbeyfeale, and residents be informed to please
keep clean and tidy.

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council reconsider leaving the Mass Path gate
open at night time. As this is currently being left open all night this is leading to anti-
social behavior and causing a nuisance to the neighbours in the area. Can this be
locked at night time and reopened in the mornings.

| will move at the next Meeting that Site Notices be placed on all on all Council owned
property being considered for disposal within our Municipal District.

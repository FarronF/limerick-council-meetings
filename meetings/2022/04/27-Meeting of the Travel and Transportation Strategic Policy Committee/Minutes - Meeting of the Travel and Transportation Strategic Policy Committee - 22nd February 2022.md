**Item 3: Update on Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) -**

**Mr. Robert Gallagher**

The Chair stated that while the final draft of the LSMATS is not yet completed, work is ongoing in

the background and it is important to get the strategy right. He invited Mr. Gallagher to brief the

members. Mr. Gallagher advised the Meeting that the NTA will be invited to a Travel and

Transportation SPC Meeting to present the draft when the second public consultation is

announced. He added that allocations for sustainable transport have not been adversely affected

by the delay. However, it is important to finalise the strategy for the development of Limerick.

The Chair thanked Mr. Gallagher and reiterated the need to finalise the strategy to future proof

funding.

**Item 4: Presentation: 2022 Funding Allocation from the NTA, TII & DoT** **–** **Mr. Brendan Kidney**

Mr. Brendan Kidney delivered a presentation on the 2022 funding allocations, showing an

increase in funding in 2022 compared to 2021 as follows: -

DoT - increase of 18% to €35,845,150

NTA - increase of 40% to €24,390,568

TII -

increase of 144% to €30,936,901

The Chair thanked Mr. Kidney for the presentation and welcomed the increase in funding, some

of which is substantial, particularly the Dooradoyle to City Centre Project. Mr. Gallagher advised

that the increase in funding is reflecting the increased cost of delivering the schemes. The funding

is positive news and he anticipates increases in future funding.

Cllr. Secas thanked Mr. Kidney for the presentation and asked if there was a timeframe in which

the funding needed to be spent.

Cllr. Mitchell welcomed the news of funding, in particular he noted the safe school program and

Beary’s Cross, and asked that Beary’s Cross be brought to the fore. He agreed that the increase

in funding reflected increased costs and inflation.

Cllr. Teefy thanked Mr. Kidney for the welcome news and asked if there would be a breakdown

for the municipal districts.

Mr. Kennedy added that the allocations are based on what the directorate intends to spend this

year. In response to Cllr. Teefy and Cllr. Mitchell, Mr. Kennedy advised that the Beary’s Cross

scheme will be going to tender shortly and anticipates that contractors will be on site in Q3/Q4

this year. He also confirmed that a schedule for District Works will be brought to all Municipal

districts in April 2022.---

**Item 5: Presentation: Mobility Management Measures for Business - Ms. Karen McDonnell**

Ms. Karen McDonnell delivered a presentation on the Mobility Management measures for

businesses in Limerick outlining the background and the national targets for the Transport Sector

under the Climate Action Plan 2021. She explained the Mobility Management Plans (MMPs) and

plans for Limerick, and outlined the project aims of the proposed pilot plan.

Cllr. Sheahan (J) thanked Ms. McDonnell for the information and stated that when the

infrastructure is put in place, the presentation will make sense. He asked if the Council could

lead by example and be involved in the pilot. Mr. Heffernan gave some examples of poor cyclist

behavior that he recently observed and felt a cycling training program is necessary.

Cllr. Secas thanked Ms. McDonnell for the presentation and asked if the company for the

proposed pilot has been identified, as she had some suggestions. Mr. Harper also thanked Ms.

McDonnell but observed it is familiar, and asked how it was different from the Smarter Travel

program.

Cllr. Mitchell noted that the plans in the presentation are ambitious and asked about other

sectors being tackled e.g. air travel and remote working. He questioned whether sustainable

modes of transport and mobility management would reduce and dictate planning.

The Chair thanked Ms. McDonnell for the presentation and enquired about looking in-house for

the pilot.

With reference to Mr. Harper’s comment, Mr. Gallagher agreed that this may not be new news

but it is up to us now as a committee to get involved and put a plan together. In response to Cllr.

Secas, Mr. Gallagher confirmed that the Council is having initial discussions with a company

identified for the pilot; however, it is open to recommendations.

In reply to Cllr. Sheahan (J), Mr. Gallagher stated that his ideas are good and sometimes

implementation is dependent on a change of attitude not infrastructure. He added that it is the

intention of the Council to encourage staff to investigate shared schemes and promote active

travel modes.

In reply to Cllr. Mitchell, Mr. Gallagher advised that airplanes are outside the remit of the Council,

however, remote working is being discussed. All zoning and planning will be determined by the

Development Plan, and businesses within the areas will then be required to submit their mobility

plan. Mr. Gallagher also acknowledged Mr. Heffernan’s comments.

Cllr. Mitchell stated this new mobility management policy will definitely affect the planning

process. In reply, Mr. Gallagher advised that the Development Plan is a mobility lead plan with

more intensive centre-out development proposed and emphasis on the 10 to 15-minute active

travel zone. Ms. McDonnell agreed with Mr. Gallagher regarding implementing measures in the

Local Authority and the other areas he addressed.---

**Item 6: Presentation: Regulating shared car service for Limerick City -** **Mr. John O’Leary**

Mr. Brendan Kidney delivered the above presentation. He explained the workings of a shared

car scheme and explained the existing Pilot Car Share Scheme in Limerick between Limerick City

and County Council and GoCar. He outlined the benefits of the scheme and explained the next

steps in preparing draft Bye-laws.

The Chair thanked Mr. Kidney for the presentation, adding that the numbers in the pilot were

impressive, especially considering Covid. He added that the service is justified and offers several

advantages. He asked if there is a facility also for a GoVan.

Cllr. Teefy welcomed the initiative and asked how widely known is the project. Mr. Harper

thanked Mr. Kidney and asked if there will be a single operator licence or multiple. Cllr. Costelloe

asked how insurance will work for the service.

In response to questions, Mr. Kidney confirmed that the operator will be going out to competition

and it will be a sole licence holder. Regarding insurance, a user needs to sign up to the club at

which insurance details will be captured; Rental is per hour**.**

He added that car share is operating in other cities and LCCC is currently promoting the initiative.

The aim is to promote the service publicly and go to tender to appoint a licenced operator.

Cllr. Mitchell welcomed the positive presentation. It will involve less cost to the user and will align

with the climate action plan however, it may be more suitable to high density areas as public

transport is still required.

Mr. Gallagher added that this is a private enterprise and market forces will dictate what is on

offer. When the benefits of this are shown, it is hoped it will be a success.

Cllr. Novak asked how prescriptive are the bye-laws on the power of the car, and as this is a

business venture, can LCCC charge the company for space.

In response, Mr. Kidney confirmed that the bye-laws cover spaces in public areas owned by the

Council. Mr. Gallagher added that the strategy is ongoing regarding electric charging and there

will be a gradual transition to EV’s as time goes on. One car share eliminates fifteen cars, as

indicated by GoCar’s own study. Cllr. Mitchell stated that the ESB is the dominant player in the

EV charging market and competition is required to keep the cost down.

The Chair proposed to get the byelaws published first and then the market will decide. Mr. Kidney

confirmed that the Council will be running a new competition once bye-laws are in place. GoCar

was a pilot but a full tender process will be put in place.---

**Item 7: Notice of Motion submitted by Mr. Bruce Harper**

That the Council will, in accordance with commitments made as signatory to the Local Authority

Climate Charter (2019), commit to not taking forward decisions, approvals or investments

relating to major transport programmes and projects (including investments in transport

infrastructure), until a process for carbon proofing the major decisions, programmes and projects

on a systematic basis has been completed and has demonstrated that the plan, programme or

investment is aligned with a low carbon pathway reducing emissions by 50% by 2030 and net

zero by 2050.

Mr. Harper read his Notice of Motion quoting the LA Climate Charter 2019 3 (f). He asked if we

are adhering to the climate Charter 2019 or is it business as usual and if so, we have to cancel

the commitment made as signatory to the local Authority Climate Charter 2019 if we are

honest.

He stated that there are three choices to be made as follows: -

1. Climate Action to the fore

2. Business as usual

3. Be honest

The Chair advised that carbon budgeting is a collective and national issue. Mr. Harper disagreed

with this statement.

Cllr. O’Hanlon expressed his concern that projects could be delayed and if the Council goes ahead

with this process, a pothole will not be filled. With regard to funding, projects will be delayed

and funding will have to be returned. As Councilors, he added there is a need to progress and

for this reason he will not support the Motion.

Mr. Gallagher acknowledged Cllr. O’Hanlon’s valid point and disagreed with Mr. Harper’s Motion.

He added that the discussions and presentations delivered today were all around various ways

of lowering carbon footprint. He advised that road projects and programmes must be looked at

in a national context and that the Council is fully transparent and honest. Doing business as usual

means that climate action will be to the fore. Transportation has changed considerably and

much of the Council’s concentration will be on sustainable transport schemes. Mr. McGlynn

advised that €24m has been allocated for sustainable projects in 2022. Mr. Gallagher stated that

there will be a high emphasis on achieving modal shift from cars to active modes and increased

public transport. LSMATS will include for modelling on emissions and will indicate how these

emissions can be reduced. LCCC will look for significant modal change from cars to public

transport, walking, cycling and shared cars. He added that the car will always be with us and is

still very important for people, especially in rural areas however, in future it will likely be an EV

or other emerging clean technology car.

Referring to Cllr. O’Hanlon’s point, Mr. Gallagher added that the NDP identifies critical road

projects in which considerable evaluation processes, in the form of technical, economic and

environmental needs, will be assessed, and this forms the basis of the evaluation process.---

Cllr. Kilcoyne agreed with Cllr. O’Hanlon, as the Motion would put a lot of pressure on the

progression of projects.

Cllr. Mitchell asked if existing roads should be upgraded, with England out of the EU. He

suggested looking at infrastructure to ports to bring goods in cheaply, and this would also help

to promote jobs.

Cllr. Teefy supported Cllr. O’Hanlon and added that she welcomes the funding received and

welcomes the Active Travel Unit. She added that Mr. Gallagher explained the position very well

and we have to progress, provide the infrastructure and spend the funding received.

Cllr. Sheahan (M) stated he would not be in favour of anything that hinders the progression of

projects and programmes. He added that major infrastructure development is needed, while we

investigate the carbon footprint in city and county. He is very satisfied with Mr. Gallagher’s

response and commended the team.

Mayor Butler stated that it is very important to note that we need certain infrastructure to move

freight. There has to be a move towards public transport and we as a Council are moving towards

that. LCCC is cognisant of Climate Action and has an Active Travel team built around sustainable

transport. We are active in bio diversity, tree planting, and the green agenda is the dominant

conversation. He also added that we need economic growth in a sustainable way and not hinder

any potential growth.

Cllr. Secas thanked Mr. Harper for the Motion and proposed an amended Motion as follows:

***“**That the Council will, in accordance with commitments made as signatory to the Local***

***Authority Climate Charter (2019), employ a process for carbon proofing in any future major***

***transport decisions, programmes and projects to ensure that the plan, programme or***

***investment is aligned with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act***

***2021.”***

Cllr. Novak stated she would be happy to support the original Motion and added that we have

signed up to the Charter, the time is now for action and if projects have a positive assessment,

there should be no problem. Local authorities have a big responsibility to deliver on Climate

Action in the transport area.

Cllr. Sheahan (M) stated that it is a catch 22 situation and he is happy to refer to Mr. Gallagher’s

response. Mayor Butler also referred to Mr. Gallagher’s response, adding that LCCC is already

carbon proofing.

Mr. Harper stated that in relation to honesty, LCCC has not put processes in place and should

withdraw the signatory to the Local Authority Climate Charter (2019) for not adhering to the

obligations.---

Mr Gallagher added that a roads project has to be looked at a local and national level, and not

in isolation in terms of carbon proofing. There is a process in place for climate proofing and we

meet with all the requirements of the National Funding and Authorities.

Cllr. Novak seconded Mr. Harper’s original Notice of Motion.

The Chair acknowledged the debate and stated he would be against withdrawing from the

Charter, and was happy with Mr. Gallaher’s assurances and the various initiatives and projects

underway. To withdraw from the charter would cause a whole myriad of issues and secondly

would tie the Council’s hands and lose funding. There was a consensus not to withdraw from the

charter and not to lose funding.

Mr. Harper requested a vote on the matter. In line with Standing Orders the vote was taken on

the amended Notice of Motion as follows: -

***“**That the Council will, in accordance with commitments made as signatory to the Local***

***Authority Climate Charter (2019), employ a process for carbon proofing in any future major***

***transport decisions, programmes and projects to ensure that the plan, programme or***

***investment is aligned with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act***

***2021.”***

**For the Proposal**

Councillors Butler, Costelloe, Foley, Kilcoyne, Mitchell, Ryan, Secas, Sheahan (M), Teefy,

Mr. T. O’Brien, Mr. F. Heffernan

(11)

**Against the Proposal**

(2)

The Chair declared the proposal to amend the wording of the Notice of Motion carried by a

vote of 11 for and 2 against.

**Item 8:** **Question submitted by Mr. Bruce Harper**

**Item 9: Question submitted by Ms. Ailish Drake**

The pedestrianisation of Foxes Bow laneway is regulated by Section 45 of the Road Traffic Act,

and signposted to that effect. But cars are driven and parked on this street every day, leading to

dangerous conditions for pedestrians using the laneway. Ostensibly pedestrian-only after 11am

with automated bollards at one end, motorists regularly drive the wrong way from Thomas St

onto this pedestrianised lane, sometimes parking in the adjoining laneways or using Foxes Bow

illegally for access to food businesses. In the context of protecting the pedestrianised spaces of

Limerick city and enforcing the established regulations governing such spaces, can the Council

1. Confirm all extant regulations in relation to the pedestrianised status of Foxes Bow and

adjoining laneways

2. Provide a solution to the dangerous environment being created for pedestrians on one

of the few pedestrianised streets in the city, up to and including bollards at the Thomas

St. entrance.

A written response to Question was circulated to all members.

The Chair thanked all members for attending and confirmed that the next SPC Meeting will be

held on Tuesday, the 19th April 2022.

The Meeting then concluded.---

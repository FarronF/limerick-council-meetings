It was noted that the thefts from the MPVs related in the vast majority to one individual.

Subsequently there has been a significant increase in the number of patrols in the area, and

the suspect has been identified but not located. No incidents have occurred since the suspect

was identified, and there is sufficient evidence to arrest the suspect once located.

In relation to the increase in Section 3 assaults, this can be attributed to the reopening of

hospitality including public houses.

The increase in Drug offences can be attributed to the work of the District Drugs unit increase

in operations.

The threat to kill took place as part of a court hearing, which resulted in the immediate arrest

of the culprit.

Superintendent Reidy also highlighted that there is ongoing work to increase Community

engagement, including the operation of the Community Bus scheme.

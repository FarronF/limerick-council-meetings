**Item 5**

**Presentation on Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan**

Paraic Rattigan, Programme Manager, Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan gave a presentation on the

newly launched Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan (MWREP), which covers Counties Limerick, Clare

and Tipperary. The MWREP was developed by a Regional Steering Committee, which includes

Enterprise Agencies, Local Enterprise Offices, Local Authorities, Regional Assembly, Higher and

Further Education Bodies and local industry leaders. The Plan was designed to generate projects,

which create jobs and help companies to grow across the region and contains a number of key

strategic objectives to be delivered over the next two years. The new Regional Enterprise

Development Fund (REDF) will provide up to €180 million funding nationally to support the

development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects, e.g.

 Strengthen the Mid-West as a national centre for advanced manufacturing,

 Deliver innovative projects to enable a sustainable Film Industry in the Mid-West

 Deliver collaborative initiatives/projects to solve healthcare problems using digital solutions

 Establish the region as a national leader in the Sports-tech and eSports sectors

 Progress regional Data Centre capacity with an emphasis on innovative/sustainable projects

The MWREP replaced the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017, which secured funding for the

Engine Collaboration Centre, the Future Mobility Campus in Shannon and the National Bio-Economy

Campus in Co. Tipperary.---
While members welcomed the presentation and commended the level of collaboration between the

stakeholders, they expressed concern over the lack of skilled workforce / trained apprentices to take

up the new jobs being created and requested that funding be directed to SMEs to enable them

recover from the downturn in business during the pandemic.

Mr. Rattigan informed members that Companies were being kept up-to-date with any new

developments in the region and informed of any opportunities available to them.

A Working Group had been set up in conjunction with the Regional Skills Forum to provide

training/upskilling in various disciplines, including Renewable Energy.

From the €180m funding, which was made available nationally under the Regional Enterprise

Development Fund, it was proposed that the Mid-West Region would receive approx. €20m and it

would be necessary to tap into other funding available also. Work was ongoing in preparing projects

for funding and only “the best projects” could be put forward, as Enterprise Ireland applied very

strict requirements in the drawdown of funding.

**Item 6**

**Update on Draft Development Plan process**

V. Murray informed members that work continued on the preparation of the Draft Limerick

Development Plan 2022 – 2028, with further workshops held with Elected Members to consider the

Chief Executives report on the submissions received during the draft plan public consultation period.

At a Special Council meeting on the 18th February the Elected Members passed a resolution to make

material amendments to the Draft Plan. The material amendments will be placed on public display

for 4 weeks from 5th March. A further Chief Executive’s report will be prepared on submissions

received and a Special Council Meeting has been scheduled for 10th June to approve the

Development Plan.

**Item 7**

**Any Other Business**

Councillors queried the building regulations covering provision of chimneys in house

construction. The Development Management Dept. would provide guidance on this matter

to committee members.

Cllr. Keary referred to proposals for development on Shannon Estuary by Shannon LNG Plant

and requested that full support be provided to the Company, by the Local Authority.

That concluded the business of the meeting.

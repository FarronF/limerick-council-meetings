a speed limit reduction had not been incorporated into the scheme and that lands

**Reply:**

Fire hydrants form part of the water infrastructure. Ownership of water

infrastructure transferred to Irish Water under the legislative provisions

governing its establishment with effect from 1st January 2014. Members

should note that when the Council becomes aware of a faulty fire hydrant

that a report is submitted to Irish Water and a subsequent work order is

issued for its investigation and repair. Any member of the public may also

report an issue with a fire hydrant to Irish Water by calling 1800 278 278.

The reply received from Irish Water to this motion is as follows;

“*Irish Water have assumed overall responsibility for the repair and*

*maintenance of fire hydrants in County Limerick as they form part of the*

*water services infrastructure. There is no existing programme in place for*

*periodic inspection of water services fixtures and fitting such as hydrants.*

*Irish Water endeavours to immediately repair any hydrants which are*

*notified as being in poor condition by either the Fire Service, members of*

*the public or as observed by Water Services staff in the course of their*

*duties”.*

This concluded the Meeting.

**Reply:**

“Limerick City and County Council has a strong focus on bringing derelict and vacant

property in its administrative area back into productive use with a particular emphasis on

areas of high housing demand in the town and village centres of the county and in the city

of Limerick.

This work is guided by key legislation as set out in the Derelict Sites Act 1990, the

Housing Act 1966, and the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act, 2015, and

implementation is underpinned by robust processes and operating procedures.

The initiative run by LCCC is informed by proactive dereliction and vacancy surveys

completed by staff throughout the administrative area, representations received

from public representatives, and complaints received from the community. Derelict

and vacant properties may also be reported by the public through

www.vacanthomes.ie .

The Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as amended), states that it is the duty of every owner and

occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become

or does not continue to be a derelict site. The Act also states that it shall be the duty of

a local authority to take all reasonable steps (including the exercise of any appropriate

statutory powers) to ensure that any land situate in their functional area does not

become or continue to be a derelict site.

The Dereliction, Vacancy & Re-use Team in the Property & Community Facilities

Department engages property owners to advise on remedial measures, providing

advice and guidance on schemes and other supports available to bring vacant and

derelict homes back into productive use.

Limerick City and County Council is required to maintain a statutory Register of

Derelict Sites. Properties entered in it are levied an annual charge payable by the

property owners. However, where properties continue to remain in a derelict state
---
and all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted with the owners, the option to

acquire the property compulsorily through statutory powers will be considered.

Unless the initial engagement immediately begins to resolve the issue, the Owner of

the property is served a notice under Section 8(2) the Derelict Sites Act 1990 of the

intention of LCCC to enter property details in to the Derelict Sites Register. Any

representation from the Owner/Occupier received with regard to this Notice within a

specified period (four weeks) is considered.

Generally, unless the dereliction issue has been addressed within the four weeks, a

Notice under section 8(7) of the Act is served on the Owner/Occupier stating that the

particulars of the land have been entered in the Derelict Sites Register. The experience

has been that many owners do not take the matter seriously until property is in the

Register.

Limerick City and County Council are required to have a market value determined under

section 22 of the Act for properties entered in the Derelict Sites Register (and at least

once every five years), and is completed by Council-appointed professional

auctioneer/valuer. In accordance with the relevant provision of the Act, the Owner may

appeal the market value determined to The Valuation Tribunal within 28 days from the

date on which the Notice under Section 22 of the Act is received by them.

Since 2020, the Derelict Site Levy is charged at 7% of market value determined. Under

section 23 of the Act, the derelict sites levy shall be paid by the owner of land to the

local authority in whose functional area the said land is situated and for which a market

value has been determined and the particulars of that land are entered on the Derelict

Sites Register on the first day of January of that local financial year. The levy shall be

payable by the Owner/Occupier on demand being made by the local authority. The

legislation also states that, in default of payment, shall be recoverable as a simple

contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Any properties entered on the Derelict Site Register may be considered for

compulsory acquisition under the Derelict Site Act, 1990. Section 14 of the Act

provides that a local authority may acquire by agreement or compulsorily any derelict

site within their functional area.

When a notice of intention to acquire a derelict site compulsorily under section 15 of

the Act is served on an Owner/ Occupier of such land, they have the opportunity to

object to this within one month of date of service. Where an objection is received, the

Council must first seek consent from An Bord Pleanála and the case application is

referred to the Board within one month after expiry of time for objection. The

approximate timeframe for determination decision (to grant or to refuse consent to the

compulsory acquisition) between date of application lodged by I-CCC to Board decision

is approximately up to 6 months (though may be extended by the Board).

Where no objection is received to the Notice of intention to Acquire Compulsorily, an

objection is withdrawn, or consent is granted by the Board following objection, the
---
property may be vested in the Council by Order and Notice under Section 17/18 of the

Act. The Vesting Order has the effect of making the site "free from encumbrance and

all estate, rights, title and interests of whatsoever kind".

Section 19(1) of the Act provides that any person who has an estate or interest in or

right in respect of a derelict site may apply to the local authority not later than twelve

months after the making of the vesting order for compensation for an amount equal

to the value (if any) of the estate, interest or right. Once confirmed by the Councils

legal advisor that the right to claim is established by a former owner/occupier, any

amount owed on an unpaid Derelict Site Levy can be deducted from compensation.

Section 20 of the Act provides that any derelict site acquired by a Local Authority may

be used for any purpose connected with their function.

Limerick City and County Council continues to seek funding through central

Government to support this work from schemes such as the Urban and Rural

Regeneration and Development Funds, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, Built

Heritage Investment Scheme, as well as advising owners of dedicated housing grants

such as Repair and Lease Scheme, Living City Tax Initiative, and energy and retrofit

grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland”.

construction of 10 no. housing units in Radharc Cillín, Kilfinane, County Limerick and

presented detail drawings of development.

The Members thanked Mr. O’Boyle and Mr. Culloo for the presentation

summary of the allocation breakdown for 2022.

The Members thanked Mr. McKechnie and welcomed the investment in projects.

In response to questions on the GMA, Mr. McKechnie advised the Members that the

decision to go with a one or two year programme was at Members discretion and advised

that a two year programme helps plan ahead for works to be carried out.

**Proposed: Councillor Teefy**

**Seconded: Councillor E. Ryan and agreed**

**7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M Ryan**

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District for Limerick

City and County Council and Ballyhoura Development Ltd to assess and plan the Slieve Felim

lands, Grageen, Clare Glens for outdoor recreation/pursuits and also assess the potential for

green energy production.

**Reply:**

**Grageen Bog**

“The Council wishes to raise a number of ecological concerns in relation to any proposals for

Grageen Bog. There are two designations in place for Grageen Bog and Fen, contained within

Slieve Felim. The first is the Special Protection Area for the Hen Harrier where a male and

female bird nests on or very close to the eastern portion of the site. These birds would be

very vulnerable to the erection of wind turbines or human disturbance on site, which would

mean that the use of the area for energy purposes would be detrimental to the bird. The site

is also used by grouse, a bird also vulnerable to human disturbance. It relies heavily on

heather, both for nesting and food in its adult stages and ranges all over this land parcel. The

Grouse bird is also of conservation concern.

Grageen Bog is also one of four Natural Heritage Area’s (NHA) in Limerick designated for

bog/peat habitats, but is additionally important because of the presence of the Fen, fed by

local ground water. The peat habitats would be vulnerable to any form of construction. The
---
area is acknowledged as being botanically diverse and is important from a regional level. It

would be important to ensure that open undisturbed uplands are kept that way to address

the huge decline of species such as curlew in Ireland, which faces extinction as a breeding

bird. Grageen Bog is very suitable habitat for this bird.

**Clare Glens**

In relation to Clare Glens, there are two designations in place. The first is the Clare Glens

Special Area of Conservation site (SAC), the second is the Lower River Shannon SAC site. The

Clare Glens SAC site is for the protection of sessile oak woods and the Killarney Fern. The Fern

population is located close to the river and any disturbance to the river if hydro is to be

considered could be detrimental as it depends heavily on shaded and moist conditions to

grow. Similarly, any disturbance to the tree cover to facilitate construction would have the

potential to affect shade and humidity which would affect the plant. It would also have the

potential to affect the oak wood part and its ground level flora. The possibility of using the

river for hydro would also involve creating structures to house the turbine and also to ensure

a head of water to power the turbines. This would modify the river and lead to tree clearance

to facilitate construction. This would not be desirable from the point of view of conservation

of the woodland.

In this regard, the Council considers that Clare Glens and Grageen Bog are unsuitable for

renewable energy development. In terms or recreational pursuits, Grageen Bog and Clare

Glens would need to be considered as part of an overall strategy for outdoor recreational

pursuits, where the possibility of connectivity to other walks in this area would need to be

considered in light of the above ecological concerns. It is important to note that Grageen Bog

and Clare Glens are in Local Authority ownership, connectivity and the possibility of

connecting to other routes in conjunction with Coillte would need to be established”.

Following discussion by the Members, Councillor Ryan requested this motion be forwarded

to be included on the Agenda of the next Climate Change and Biodiversity SPC in relation to

Recreational pursuits for further discussion.

**Proposed: Councillor - M.Ryan**

**Seconded: Councillor - E. Ryan and agreed**

**8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor PJ Carey**

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that an update

on works at the Stone Mansion/Merchants House, Kilmallock be given. And if possible, an

approximate starting date for commencement of works might also be given.

**Reply:**

“Since Limerick City and County Council’s application to Fáilte Ireland was turned down in

2017 Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) has addressed the identified action in Fáilte

Ireland’s response by engaging with the appropriate Departments to develop the full

footprint of the amenity as a single shared project. The National Monuments Service of the

Department of Housing, Local Government & Heritage (DHLGH) are the owners of the site

and the National Monuments Section of the Office of Public Works (OPW) under the

Department of Finance maintain and manage the monuments in State ownership or

guardianship on behalf of the Minister. Under this partnership, there is a separate stream of

Fáilte Ireland funding available to State organisations, which will be accessed for the project.

The State will retain ownership and develop the 16th century structure at the street frontage,

while the Local Authority will simultaneously develop the rear building and its attendant

courtyard buildings and will ultimately manage the facility in partnership with Kilmallock

Tourism Development Ltd.

In 2016-2017 the Office of Public Works carried out large scale works to the entire structure,

replacing most of the roof and consolidating the southern gable.

In 2018 a revised Feasibility Study was commissioned by LCCC using T&V funding to reflect

the addition of the Victorian (middle) house to the Local Authority. This addition was the

outcome of joint meetings between all parties.

In 2018 a Local Authority budget was identified as match funding for the project.

In 2019 archaeological test excavations were carried out on behalf of the OPW within the 16th

century building which identified original floor levels and resolved elements of future design.

During 2019 further meetings were held between the parties and a draft joint vision

statement for the overall project was devised and work on the lease agreement between

DHLGH & LC&CC was progressed.

Since the advent of Covid 19 resources were stretched and diverted away from the project.

Since the beginning of 2022, however, there have been renewed communications regarding

the lease arrangement. This is a complex project but the preliminary design remains feasible

and there is a solid business case and capital appraisal in place.

From the Local Authority side the next steps are:

 Appoint a QS to prepare procurement documents for a design team to bring the LCCC

element of the project to detailed design stage.

 Finalise the lease.

 Carry out archaeological investigations within the remainder of the building and within

the adjoining plot to the south.
---
 Work with the State partners to prepare for resubmission of the application under the

Fáilte Ireland Large Capital Grant Scheme.

 Start the Part 8 procedure.

 Based on the Revised Feasibility Study carry out an overall Interpretation Study.

 Work on the design of the Medieval Garden and the open air space.

It is likely to take 2 years before construction would commence”.

Councillor Carey accepted the reply and recommended that the Members visit the site.

**Proposed: Councillor - PJ Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor** **–** **M. Donegan and agreed.**

Ms. McCutcheon briefed the Members on the history and background of the Stone

Mansion/Merchants House, Kilmallock town.

Limited thanked Ms. Ms. McCutcheon for the update.

**10. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan**

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District

calling on Limerick City and County Council to complete a pedestrian footpath and

review traffic calming measures from Elton Close housing estate to Elton village.

**Reply:**

“The Cappamore-Kilmallock MD have secured funding through the NTA Active Travel

Programme to construct a new footpath that will connect Elton Close to the crossroads

in the village. The provision of the footpath should act as a traffic calming measure in

addition to being a facility for pedestrians. It should be noted that there is minor land

acquisition required and the scheme will require the normal planning approvals”.

**Proposed: Councillor Donegan**

**Seconded: Councillor M. Ryan and Agreed**
---
**11. Question submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell**

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that

footpaths installed in Cappamore/Killmallock district be of rich cement base to

avoid weeds and for safety purposes and unnecessary work for tidy town volunteers

and community workers.

**Reply:**

“All footpaths in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District are constructed

using high quality concrete as set out in National Standards, Tll Specification for

Roadworks Series 1100 and concrete specification standard IS EN 206-1: 2013”.

**12. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan**

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District if

Limerick City & County Council plan to install public car park signage In the vicinity of

Emmett Street and Charleville road, Kilmallock.

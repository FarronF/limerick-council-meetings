**Kilcornan Tidy Towns Committee Request**

The Meetings Administrator provided Members with a response from The Senior

Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division, as follows:

There are 2 locations in Kilcornan utilised by Limerick City & County Council Road Crews.

A small depot across the road from the entrance to Curraghchase is used for signage

storage and has welfare facilities. This depot has security fencing

around it and laurel hedging was planted in late Autumn 2021 outside the fence to make

it more presentable. This is an established Depot for a significant number of years.

On the opposite side of the road across from the Old Coach Inn, there is a temporary

storage depot for chips and other materials. This depot has been used intermittently for

spoil over the years, with Council crews utilising it more extensively over the past 2 years

since the realignment of Operational Areas with Municipal Districts.

These are the only available depots for our crews operating in the western part of Adare

Rathkeale District which would previously have operated out of the Kinard Depot in Glin

which is now in the Newcastle West Municipal District. The alignment of Operational

Areas with Municipal Districts makes the Kinard Depot impractical for use in the Adare

Rathkeale Municipal District.

It is planned to carry out works to make this site more secure to prevent unauthorised

access. It is also planned to carry out extensive Landscaping to screen the site

appropriately to make it aesthetically acceptable..

Long-term from an Operational viewpoint, the Council are actively reviewing Depot

locations with the aim of securing a Permanent Depot location.

Discussion ensued and the Elected Members were all in agreement with the people of

Kilcornan that an alternative depot be sought as a matter of urgency. Councillor Sheahan

proposed they be kept updated on a quarterly basis on the progress on this matter. This

was seconded by Councillor Keary and agreed.

**6.**

**Request to Receive Deputation from The Maigue Rivers Trust**

Circulated, report from The Maigue Rivers Trust outlining their work to date and their

request to give a presentation to the Elected Members of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal

District. Councillor Collins proposed a Deputation be received by the Adare-Rathkeale

Municipal District from the group when Covid restrictions ease. This was seconded by

Councillor Sheahan and agreed.

Collar back to Limerick on loan for a period of time. The Meetings Administrator advised

Councillor O’Brien this Motion would have to go to Full Council for agreement.

**8.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the necessary steps be taken to ensure Askeaton**

**is officially classified as a heritage town.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Keary and

agreed.

In proposing the motion Councillor Sheahan advised he wanted to make an amendment

to the motion to change a heritage town to a historic town due to cost factors involved.

He further requested appropriate road signage be erected on all approach roads into the

town to indicate it is a historic town and also the oldest town in Limerick.

**Reply:**

The designation of heritage town status to towns throughout Ireland was

part of a scheme run in the early 1900’s, by Bord Failte, at the time. This

scheme is no longer recognised by the Heritage Council, although the

associated signage is still in place in many of the towns.

The Heritage Council currently have no plans to create any similar

designations, however they do recognise heritage status of towns around

the Country both through the Irish Walled Towns Network and through

the Historic Towns Initiative.

The town of Askeaton is classified as a Historic Town under the National

Monuments Act and is a Recorded Monument, Ll011-092001, included on

the Sites and Monuments Register and the Zone of Notification for the

town incorporates a large amount of the Local Area Plan area.

The Local Authority could examine the provision of entrance signage to

emphasise the medieval status and importance of Askeaton.

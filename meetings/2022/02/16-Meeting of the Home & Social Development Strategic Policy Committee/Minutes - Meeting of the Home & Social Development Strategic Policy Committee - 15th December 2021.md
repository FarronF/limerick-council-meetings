**Item 3: Presentation on Dereliction and Vacancy** **–** **Gordon Daly**

Gordon Daly, Director of Service, Community, Tourism & Culture, gave a presentation of

Dereliction and Vacancy to SPC members.

Mr. Daly noted that Housing for All is a key guiding document and Pathway 4 is the Pathway

to Addressing Vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock.

The presentation outlined some of the issues that can lead to vacancy – ownership,

financial, personal issues and property.

Mr. Daly noted that Limerick City and County Council has a full time Vacant Homes Officer

since 2018. The current post holder is Mr. David O’Grady.

Mr. Daly noted as of end of November 2021, Limerick City & County Council has 297 no.

properties with details entered in its Derelict Sites Register.

Mr. Daly advised that since 2019, LCCC have served 166 no. notices under Section 15

to compulsorily acquire derelict properties. 102 properties have been compulsorily acquired

and vested in LCCC under Section 17/18 of the Act.

Mr. Daly also advised that the legislation is useful in tackling unfinished housing

developments. LCCC cases progressed through Derelict Sites process **1)** Ballywilliam Close

Estate, Rathkeale **2)** Cois Na Feile, Abbeyfeale **3)** Ballyanrahan, Patrickswell

A discussion took place and the main points were:

 Long-term voids and a concern regarding charges on derelict properties since COVID-

19. A concern around charges on derelict units being transferred to new owners was

also raised.

 The policy in regard to buildings owned by the OPW. Feedback on progress to

members of the public who registered a complaint

 Definition of dereliction and the right to appeal.

 The potential of selling CPO units to cuckoo funds and the retention of units in LCCC

ownership.

 Mr. Daly advised the legislation provides the guidance for how a building could be

considered derelict but an inspector will draft a report on a building and Mr. Daly or

Ms. Crowe make a decision based on the report.

 Mr. Daly advised that units go on the open market and anyone who is interested can

bid but there is open communication with the Housing team in relation to

properties. Mr. Daly went on to say that under the legislation, derelict units are

compulsorily acquired to take the unit out of dereliction and it is not solely for the

purpose of housing.

**Item 5: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

I will move at the next meeting of the Home and Development S.P.C that this Council writes

to the Housing Minister to ask him to raise the income eligibility limit for social housing in

Limerick

Cllr. Sheehan advised that he was formally proposing this motion as some constituents are

being locked out of the housing market due to the rising costs of house prices and are

unable to qualify for social housing.

A discussion took place and it was agreed that the reference to Limerick would be omitted

and the following notice of motion be recommended to Council for adoption:

**That this Council write to the Minister for Housing to ask him to raise the income eligibility**

**limit for social housing**

**Item 7: AOB**

 A copy of Mr. Gordon Daly’s presentation will be circulated to all SPC members and

the PPN Linkage group as requested.

 A query was raised as to whether LCCC take into account public transport when

building new housing schemes. Mr. Conor Culloo advised that linkages to public

transport would be of utmost importance in any design and it would be considered
---
in the context of the overall scheme but that it would be factored in the decision

making.

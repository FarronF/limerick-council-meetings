NOTICES OF MOTION

1.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Egan

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that Limerick

City and County Council Library service produce a document to commemorate local

engagement in the Irish War of Independence in Limerick City and County similar to the War

of Independence West Cork Trail published by Cork County Council Library Service.”

**It was proposed by Councillor Egan that this Notice of Motion be forwarded for inclusion**

**on the agenda of the next Full Council meeting. This was agreed unanimously by all Elected**

**Members present.**

**Councillor Donegan**

**Councillor Mitchell**

**Councillor M Ryan**

**Councillor Teefy**

Independence in Limerick City and County similar to the War of Independence West Cork Trail

published by Cork County Council Library Service is recognised as a very worthwhile project

2.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

**“**I will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that the

Council accommodate a request from some locals of Tankardstown, Kilmallock to allow them

the purchase of Burial Plots at Tankardstown Cemetery.”

**Reply:**

Tankardstown Graveyard is located within the townland of Tankardstown South. It contains two

Recorded Monuments (LI047-011001/002 Church & Graveyard) dating to at least the late 1200’s. It is

the policy of the Local Authority to not permit the sale of new burial plots in ancient cemeteries which

are on the Record of Monuments. Families with existing burial plots can continue to use them, subject

to the plot not being at full capacity.

The graveyard was surveyed in 2007, on foot of concerns raised by both elected officials and the public

regarding elevated rock levels. The survey was to determine the levels of rock in areas of ground that

looked as though they did not contain existing burial plots. The survey confirmed elevated rock levels

in these areas.

Limerick City and County Council would be prepared develop a section of the graveyard, subject to

approval from the National Monuments Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government &
---
Heritage (HGLH) for cremated remains only, the sale of which would be a maximum of two plots per

family and at time of need only.

In reference to the adopted Burial Ground Strategy, there is ample capacity to meet the needs of the

community at both Ballingaddy and Bruree CemeteriesThe Elected Members were not satisfied

with the response.

**It was requested by the Elected Members that the Notice of Motion be amended to read:**

**“**I will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that the

Council accommodate a request from some locals of Tankardstown, Kilmallock to allow them

the purchase of Burial Plots at Tankardstown Cemetery and to extend the cemetary to include

an additional 50-100 burial plots.”

There was also a request that an explanation of the policy regarding selling burial plots in

ancient burial grounds be provided, the policy be revisited, and that the Planning department

be invited to discuss the issue at the next Municipal District Meeting. The Director of Services

agreed that a representative from the relevant department would be requested to attend the

next Municipal District Meeting.

3.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that

remedial work be carried out on the R514 in the area of Raleighstown/Ballingoola to

improve sight lines on the road and make the junction with the local road L5075 safer.”

**Proposed: Councillor Teefy**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan**

**Reply:**

that may be necessary and revert to Cllr. Teefy with details of the review.

**9.Question submitted by Ms. Ailish Drake**

The pedestrianisation of Foxes Bow laneway is regulated by Section 45 of the Road

Traffic Act, and signposted to that effect. But cars are driven and parked on this street

every day, leading to dangerous conditions for pedestrians using the laneway.

Ostensibly pedestrian-only after 11am with automated bollards at one end, motorists

regularly drive the wrong way from Thomas St onto this pedestrianised lane,

sometimes parking in the adjoining laneways or using Foxes Bow illegally for access to

food businesses. In the context of protecting the pedestrianised spaces of Limerick

city and enforcing the established regulations governing such spaces, can the Council

1. Confirm all extant regulations in relation to the pedestrianised status of Foxes Bow

and adjoining laneways

2. Provide a solution to the dangerous environment being created for pedestrians on

one of the few pedestrianised streets in the city, up to and including bollards at the

Thomas St entrance.---

**Item 2: EV Charging Strategy Preparation (Brendan Kidney)**

Mr. Kidney delivered a presentation on the EV charging Strategy outlining the background, the

national targets and the targets for the transport sector under the Climate Action Plan 2021. He

explained the context of the electrification of the Local Authority fleet and the next steps in

drafting an EV strategy for Limerick.

The Chair thanked Mr. Kidney for the presentation and opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Butler thanked Mr. Kidney and stated that his only concern would be street clutter. He added

that there is an unnecessary duplication of signage, which can create issues for people with visual

impairment. He asked how the growing competition for signage on footpaths can be addressed.

Cllr. Novak agreed with Cllr. Butler and added that her concern would be locking in car

dependency, as the intention is to make our city and town centres more accessible for

pedestrians.

Cllr. Teefy highlighted that there are no public charging points in Cappamore / Kilmallock area

and asked for a timeline on the installation of charging points at this location.

In response to questions, Mr. Kidney advised that it is anticipated that a draft strategy will be

rolled out in the first quarter of 2022 followed by a further update. He added that public

buildings and parking facilities in area offices will be considered for charging points and as part

of LSMATS, mobility hubs will be part of the strategy in the larger urban areas.

In relation to street clutter, Mr. Kidney advised that a review of a location will be undertaken to

avoid charging points becoming a mobility problem, particularly to people with visual

impairments. Mr. Gallagher added that charging points will not necessarily be located on public

streets, they can be located in public buildings and public car parks. He added that 80% of

charging will be done at home and public charging stations will only be used when necessary.

In response to Cllr. Novak, Mr. Gallagher also added that the intention is to pursue an Active

Travel agenda. He is very aware of car dependency in rural areas where public transport is not a

feature at present but rural communities also need to be catered for.

Cllr. Secas agreed with the points raised and added she would have concerns regarding an

imbalance between city and rural areas. She raised the issue of maintenance of charging stations

and the need to address the issue of ‘out of order’ charging stations. She also raised the issue of

cost, stating that there will be no difference between the cost of petrol and electric charging fee

in the future.

Cllr. Ryan supported Cllr. Teefy’s sentiments regarding the nonexistence of charging points in

Cappamore/Kilmallock area. He suggested that petrol stations with combined supermarkets be

considered for charging stations in the county areas. He added that charging stations at Park and

Ride facilities would need to be an option, however in order to work successfully a proper public

transport system is needed in the city.

In reply, Mr. Kidney agreed that charging points at petrol stations will be considered and

encouraged in the strategy. Mr. Gallagher added that mobility hubs and Park and Ride facilities

will be very important in terms of what the Council is trying to achieve. They require a good

operating public transport system, which is a current goal of the Council. The council will look at

the Park & Ride sites as being suitable sites for charging points and will work with private entities

like supermarkets etc.

Mr. Kennedy added that the LSMATS is planning for the next 20 years and it will take that length

of time to get ultimately where we want to be. Park and Ride is a long-term strategy and the

Active Travel team, which is an unprecedented resource, is currently being put in place. Referring

to Cllr. Ryan’s comment on the bus network, Mr. Kennedy confirmed that the NTA will be

appointing a consultant to do a BusConnects scheme for the entire metro area.

**Item 3: Delivery Strategy for City** **–** **A look at best practice elsewhere (Karen McDonnell)**

Ms. McDonnell delivered a presentation on the considerations needed for a Parcel Delivery

Strategy for the city, outlining the project aims under the draft LSMATS and the draft Limerick

Development Plan. She also gave examples of public and private led initiatives drawn from case

studies and outlined the next steps in preparing a draft Delivery Strategy for Limerick.

Cllr. Leddin thanked Ms. McDonnell for the informative presentation and as an SPC, he added

that Members are fully supportive of the strategy.

Cllr. Butler commended Ms. Mc Donnell on the presentation, stating that it is very exciting

initiative, which he fully supports. He added that the secondary benefits will help to make our

city a little bit more attractive, safer and quieter and a better place to live. He looks forward to

hearing an update.

Cllr. Novak fully supported Cllr. Butler’s comments. In relation to the large delivery trucks, she

asked if staggered or early delivery times for big retailers could be examined to free up traffic

congestion.

Cllr. Leddin supported Cllr. Novak’s sentiments, agreeing that the timing of deliveries needs to

be included in the strategy. He added that a plan needs to be put in place and referenced the

traders on Bedford Row and Cruises Street, where the bollards are raised at certain times.

Ms. McDonnell confirmed that the timing of deliveries will certainly be examined in developing

the strategy and also the needs of the retailers.

Cllr. Ryan stated that the last mile initiative is very important for cities. He suggested consulting

with An Post, which has made a model similar to that in the presentation. They have their

network going through the city and they have started to change over to electric vehicles. He

suggested that Limerick establishes a pilot project to see if the last mile initiative would work for

the smaller retailers. He also cautioned that HGV drivers have restricted driving time and there

is a shortage of available qualified drivers. The strategy also needs to be cognisant of traders

trying to get deliveries and also having freedom of movement of their goods, so that they are

controlling their costs properly.

**Item 4: Park Magic Disabled Parking App (Brian Kennedy)**

Mr. Kennedy delivered a presentation on the Disabled Parking Park Magic App adding that it is

Ireland’s first real time system for locating and navigating to Disabled parking spaces. He

explained that the app was launched the previous week in conjunction with the Disabled Driver’s

Association Ireland (DDAI). He explained the working and technology of the app and displayed

the disabled parking spaces on the app’s map to show that Limerick is an accessible city.

The Chair thanked Mr. Kennedy, adding that the launch received very good coverage on national

media. He opened the floor to comments and questions.

Cllr. Butler stated that the app is a great innovation and a very simple solution to a very important

problem that needed to be addressed. He added that a number of individuals and groups have

contacted the Mayor’s office about the app, and the level of impact and innovation has been very

positive. He commended Mr. Kennedy and the team.

Cllr. McSweeney concurred with Cllr. Butler and stated that the app is extremely beneficial and

makes a major difference to people's lives. As a user he wished to identify that some disabled

spaces are not on the app i.e., spaces by Arthurs Quay on Patrick Street. He highlighted that

Members were not notified prior to the launch of the app, and maybe this could be noted

regarding other launches going forward.

Cllr. Teefy congratulated Mr. Kennedy and the team on Limerick being first to launch the app.

Cllr. Secas concurred stating it is a great initiative and game changer, and wished all the best luck

in the future. Cllr. Ryan also congratulated Mr. Kennedy and enquired about rolling the app out

to county towns.

Mr. Kennedy thanked all for their comments and positive feedback. In response to Cllr.

McSweeney, he advised that he will bring the issue of parking spaces near Arthurs Quay to the

Traffic Team to address. He also invited the Members to contact the executive if there are areas

with a deficiency that can be examined. In relation to the format used to launch the app, Mr.

Kennedy advised that a press release was issued a couple of weeks earlier and the intention was

to bring the presentation to the SPC Meeting today to notify all Members.

In response to Cllr. Ryan, Mr. Kennedy stated that the app will provide real time information that

can be planned for in the future, and the Council is certainly interested in rolling it out further

outside the central business district, into the rest of the metro and the rest of the municipal

districts, where there are disabled parking spaces. There is interest in rolling this out on a

national basis and the Minister’s office has been in touch as the Minister is very keen to progress.

**Item 5: Connecting Ireland** **–** **Rural Mobility Plan (Peter Williams)**

Mr. Williams delivered a presentation on the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility plan, explaining

why it is needed and the benefits of the plan. He outlined the enhanced rural mobility public

transport plan for Limerick with the rollout of new and improved services expected to happen on

a phased basis from 2022 to 2025.

The Chair thanked Mr. Williams for the Presentation adding that it is good to see improvement

in connectivity of rural Ireland. He opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Novak commended all of the team. While she acknowledged that the four great

presentations delivered are in draft form, they are moving in the right direction.

Cllr. Secas agreed with the sentiments and commended all the team. She added that the meeting

was the most positive SPC she has attended. It is all good and positive news and she does not

see anyone having any objections to the proposals.

Mr. Gallagher added that it is great to see the last presentation where the NTA are now realising

that public transport is not just for people living in the city, it is also for the rural areas. The idea

that public transport will increase frequency and create new services on the lesser routes over

the next number of years is very welcome and added that we as a council think the NTA is

certainly moving in the right direction.

The Chair confirmed that all presentations will be shared and thanked all for their support over

the last 12 months at the various meetings. He added that it has been challenging with Covid

and the delay of LSMATS, but the meeting has been positive. He wished all a safe, happy and

peaceful Christmas. He confirmed that the next Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 22nd February,

2022.

The Meeting then concluded.

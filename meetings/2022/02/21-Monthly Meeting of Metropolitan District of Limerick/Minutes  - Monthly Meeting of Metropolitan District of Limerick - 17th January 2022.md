**QUESTIONS**

3.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what plans have the Council***

***to deal with the urgent issue of graves waterlogging at Mount St. Oliver and Mount St. Lawrence***

***Graveyards. This matter is very upsetting for people visiting loved ones graves and needs to be***

***addressed as soon as possible. An up to date drainage system needs to be put in place and funds***

***spent on these graveyards.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council, in assessing the development of new cemeteries, includes

ground water levels as a key criteria in the determination of whether land is suitable for use

as a cemetery. There is a work programme in place where this occurs to mitigate or resolve

the problem.

Mount Saint Oliver Cemetery

A surface water drainage works programme commenced in Mount Saint Oliver Cemetery in

2021, where elevated ground water levels are experienced. It is intended to complete these

works in 2022.

Mount Saint Lawrence Cemetery (Extension)

Elevated surface water levels are not an issue in Mount Saint Lawrence Cemetery

(Extension).

With the increased footfall as a result of the pubic visiting the cemetery over the Christmas

/ New Year period, combined with inclement weather conditions, the pedestrian grass

margin between the graves became worn under foot.

We will continue to monitor the ground conditions on an ongoing basis.

4.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick have the Council any plans***

***to install a pedestrian crossing off the Tipperary Road Ro**undabout near Chadwick’s.  There is a***

***crossing at the other side of the Roundabout and a crossing is needed at the Tipperary Road side***

***for pedestrians who walk and run.  This crossing is needed as a matter of safety.***

**REPLY**: A review will be undertaken of the pedestrian crossing facilities on the Ballysimon Road.

Consideration will be given to the installation of a pedestrian crossing as requested subject

to funding being made available.

5.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick is there any plans to erect***

***height limit warning signs at the road access into Boherkyle from the Old Cork Road (R512) and***

***also the road access into Boherkyle from the Old Ballysimon Road? This would help to advise***

***trucks of the height limit of the bridge at Boherkyle, as many trucks have to reverse out and it is***

***causing a safety hazard to the residents of Boherkyle and the motorists that use this area.***

**REPLY**: There is height restriction signage currently in place upon entry to this road from both the

Old Cork Road and Old Ballysimon roadsides.

An additional 3 tonne limit sign will be installed at the entry point from the Old Ballysimon

road side as an additional warning for any approaching HGU vehicles. A 3 tonne limit sign

is currently in place upon entry from the Old Cork Road entry side.

6.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the status***

***of Loughmore Canal, Raheen, for details of the water sampling that has taken place there and***

***an update on its current status.***

**REPLY**: Sampling at Loughmore Canal was carried out by Limerick City and County Council in

November 2021 as part of an ongoing investigation. Further sampling will be carried out in

2022 as the investigation requires.

The Council continues to engage with all relevant stakeholders as part of this investigation.

7.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on waste***

***collection times during Covid and what times waste collections providers are allowed to operate***

***to collect refuse within the city.***

**REPLY**: Waste collection times are specified in the Waste Collection Permit, which is issued to

permitted waste collectors by the National Waste Collection Permit Office (NWCPO), which

is based in Tullamore, Co. Offaly.

In March 2020, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the NWCPO has written to waste

collectors advising that “*no time limit applies for the collection of household kerbside waste*

*for the duration of the current COVID-19 health crisis.”*

8.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick why Planning did not***

***stipulate noise mitigation measures as part of planning permissions granted to housing***

***developments in the areas affected by the Motorway noise, and given that some estates such***

***as Evanwood are not finished long an**d Kylemore is still ongoing if some money of the lodged***

***bonds can be used towards the cost of erecting a noise reducing fencing in these areas until TII***

***undertake the Pilot Acoustic Mitigation Project.***
---
4

**REPLY**: Noise assessments were not undertaken for some of the earlier housing estates in the

Castletroy/Monaleen area adjacent to the M7 (e.g. Cherryfield, Thornfield) and where they

were (e.g. Evanwood, Kylemore) predicted road noise levels in private outdoor amenity

areas (gardens) were underestimated by the developers engineers.

At the time that planning applications were reviewed for those housing estates the negative

impact on health by environmental noise was not well understood and relevant conditions

were not attached to permissions granted.

The Council has worked in cooperation with TII in assessing the impact of road noise on

residents living close to the M7 motorway and is waiting to establish whether a Pilot Study

will commence.

As the developments were built in accordance with the permissions granted, it is therefore

not possible to use bonds for additional works.

9.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

 

***l will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, as part of the Opera Site***

***Development, have the Council decided to include a time capsule in the project and if so, let the***

***Limerick public decide on its contents.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council and Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC are happy to confirm that

they welcome the proposal for the inclusion of a time capsule on the Opera project site.

LCCC/LTT will organise a public event that allows the Limerick public to decide on the Time

Capsule’s contents. The Time Capsule can be situated in either the new public Library or an

equivalent public area within the development.

10.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how much progress has***

***been made with the St. Ann’s Court, Island Road site and the Orchard Site, Castle Street and***

***when will work commence on these sites.***

 

**REPLY**: Orchard Site: The Orchard Site development is approved by the Department of Housing,

Local Government and Heritage to advance to tender stage. Residual design issues are

currently in the process of being resolved ahead of the tendering process being advanced.

Expressions of interest have also been sought from Approved Housing Bodies interested in

managing the development across the construction process and thereafter upon

completion. Assessment of applications is currently being organised.

St. Ann’s Court: The archaeological investigations conducted last year have been recorded

in a comprehensive report for the St. Ann’s Court site, including the adjacent corner site

facing Athlunkard Street known as Sonny’s Corner. This is currently under review by LCCC.

Further archaeological investigation will be required across the width of the road to

attempt to establish the exact parameters of the former city gate. LCCC have produced an

initial volume study for affordable housing on the site. The archaeological report will be

used to adjust/verify the volume study which will also look at suggestions for how best to

integrate the findings, and the city wall, into any future project and urban realm proposal

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, how many social*** ***clauses***

***have been applied to tenders in the past year and what percentage did this make up of overall***

***tenders.***

**REPLY:** As Meetings Administrator, I sought replies to Councillor Bensons Question from the

relevant Directorates, and the replies received are as follows:

**Reply from Economic Development and Enterprise:**

Economic Development are not involved directly in construction contracts. However, the

Limerick 2030 DAC and Innovate Limerick DAC are both engaged in construction works

contracts involving the Social Clause.

In relation to this I can confirm that Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC and Innovate Limerick DAC

wants to ensure as far as possible that the project makes a real contribution to the

structural and social regeneration of the local community, contributing to a sustainable

future for local people and businesses. The Employer intends to deliver "community

benefit" outcomes from its procurement activity with a view to ensuring that wider social

issues are taken into account.

Contracts awarded in the last 12 months with Social Clause included are:

1. LTT – Opera Site Demolition Works Contract - SISK

2. IL – Digital Collaboration Centre Dominic Street – Nautic Construction.

**Reply from Housing:**

In the past year, the LA Housing Construction Department have Limerick City and County

Councils Employment Charter included in the tender pack for two projects. This made up

100% of the tenders signed.

**Reply from Regeneration:**

The Social Clause was applied to 12 projects, from a total of 19 projects that were procured

by the Regeneration Directorate in 2021. The Social Clause was included in 63% of the

contracts procured in 2021.

The projects that included the Social Clause are as follows:

 Cliona Park Phase 3;
---

 Churchfield Phase 2;

 Dalgaish Park / Cosgrave Park Construction Contract;

 Sheep Street / Athlunkard Street Construction Contract;

 Wall replacement 8/9 Rose Court;

 Demolition of Galvone Arms & STA Furniture Building, Galvone, Southill;

 Demolition of 204 – 208 Valley View, O’Malley Park;

 Demolition of 319 – 322 Larkin Drive, O’Malley Park;

 Demolition of 527 & 528 Castle Oaks View, O’Malley Park;

 Demolition of 353 & 354 Roseview Drive, O’Malley Park;

 Demolition 45, 47 & 49 Lenihan Avenue, Ballinacurra Weston;

 Demolition of 402 – 404 Roseview Drive, O’Malley Park.

The Social Clause was not included in the procurement for the following works, which were

procured via five quotes from local contractors:

 Traffic management works Limerick Youth Service, Galvone Ind. Estate;

 Southill Boxing Club Works;

 Demolition of 345 Rose View Drive and 32 Rose Court;

 Four refurbishment tenders, Northside.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

14.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor** **E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that presentations of***

***waste bye-laws are enforced within the city centre to ensure receptacles cannot remain on the***

***street in between collection days.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Butler and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Donovan stated that bins were sometimes being left on the

streets on non-collection days.

**REPLY**: It is an offence under the Presentation of Waste Byelaws to store refuse on a public road,

footway or pathway, except during designated times to allow for waste collection.

However, under Section 4 of the byelaws, permission may be given by an authorised officer

to designate certain public areas for bin storage. The compliance rates on the streets of the

city with the byelaws are very high, and breaches of the byelaws are followed up by the

Council’s Environmental Inspectors.

The Council also seeks to take a proactive and coordinated approach to the provision of

waste receptacles, for example, under the current Limerick City Centre laneways project

there has been active engagement with owners and businesses on the laneways, and there

has been some success in removing bins from laneways through this engagement.

The Council will continue to work on a cross-departmental basis to enhance the city centre,

including working with property owners to apply proactive solutions to waste receptacles

in the City Centre.

Members agreed that this issue should be discussed in more detail and agreed that a Briefing

should be arranged in relation to same. Members requested that a senior staff member should

attend to deal with any queries raised by the Members during the discussion on Notice of Motions.

15. **Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

**Update on Development Plan Process**

Maria Woods, Senior Planner, informed members that following public consultation on the Draft

Development Plan 2022-2028; 285 submissions were received, which were divided into various

themes, with the majority relating to City and Environs. The Forward Planning Team were currently

reviewing all submissions received prior to preparing the Chief Executive’s Report, which will be

presented to Elected Members at Council Meeting in February 2022. Any material alterations to the

Draft Plan will go on public display and a Chief Executive’s Report will be prepared on submissions

received and presented to Elected Members in May 2022, when it is hoped to adopt the

Development Plan. Invitations will be issued to hold a number of workshops early next year.

While members welcomed the update on the Development Plan process, they queried the possibility

of extending the period to adopt the Development Plan and was informed by M. Woods that an

extension could only be granted if the process had been impeded due to Covid reasons. She stated

that Forward Planning had not been affected by Covid-19 in progressing the Development Plan

process, which was now at a very advanced stage and the granting of an extension would not be

beneficial in the completion of the Development Plan process.

been referred to An Bord Pleanala and the guidelines used by ABP in making their decisions and

suggested that their policies should be in line with Limerick City and County Council policies.

forwarded to the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Local Government to bring forward

legislation that An Bord Pleanala have regard to policies in the Limerick Development Plan, along

with National Policy, taking account of habitual objectors.

M. Woods informed members that it was not practical to hold workshops at Municipal level and that

she will endeavour to convene them in person, subject to public health guidelines.

Members also expressed concern at the delay by An Bord Pleanala on making a decision on the

Limerick-Foynes Road which has now been deferred to 28th January, 2022.

**LCETB / LEO Training Skills Supports for Business**

Ms. Eimear Brophy, Further Education & Training Manager, Limerick, Clare Education and Training

Board (LCETB) informed members that LCETB is the state education and training authority for the

Limerick and Clare region. It was created following the amalgamation of three Vocational Education

Committees(VEC’s) in Limerick City, County Limerick and County Clare.

In July, 2014, it assumed responsibility from SOLAS of 2 former Training Centres in Raheen, Limerick

and Shannon, Co. Clare.

LCETB employs 2,500 staff, has an average annual budget of €130m across all its divisions and its

capital programme will see an investment in excess of €90m in the region over the next four years.

Ms. Brophy informed members of the following training skills/supports for businesses, provided by

the LCETB: Apprenticeship training and work-based learning, and skills to advance, which provides

upskilling and reskilling to employees in jobs undergoing change and to those currently employed in

vulnerable sectors. The LCETB also work closely with the Mid-West Regional Skills Forum, who

provide training in the following clusters: manufacturing, logistics, retail, hospitality, film and IT.

While members thanked Eimear for the very comprehensive presentation, they expressed concern at

the lack of qualified trades available in various sectors and particularly in the area of construction.

She informed members that SOLAS are networking with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF)

and other agencies in redressing the timescale involved in the provision of training for various trades.

She also pointed out that apprenticeship training is now included as an option on the Central

Applications Offer (CAO) Form and that representatives from Companies are visiting schools in the

region, encouraging students to follow the apprenticeship route in taking up employment.

Ms. Brophy also referred to a programme to tackle unemployment in Regeneration areas, where

training is provided to local youths in blocklaying, kerbing and paving and once completed, each

participant gains meaningful employment with sub-contractors.

**in relation to the proposed development of a new town on the Clare side of the University**

**objectives of the Limerick Draft Development Plan 2022-28 or the Mid-West Area**

**Strategic Plan 2012-30 in relation to Limerick City Centre?”**

Members expressed concern that the proposed development of a new town on the Clare side of the

University of Limerick campus could inhibit/delay the development of the campus in the city centre.

They also raised concerns in relation to the existing road network, the risk of flooding and public

transport in the area.

V. Murray confirmed that Limerick City & County Council have been in discussion with

representatives from UL and Clare County Council, who are looking to establish a Strategic

Development Zone(SDZ) of a 200 acre extension of the existing campus. The development will

include residential, academic and retail opportunities, including a marina in the area.

UL have assured that prioritisation will be given to development of the former Dunnes Stores

building at Sarsfield Street and they hope to progress development on this site over the next 12

months.

V. Murray also pointed out that the proposed SDZ was not located in a flood zone area and that

works were progressing on the Limerick Northern Distributor Road and that the Limerick Shannon

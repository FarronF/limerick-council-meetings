**QUESTIONS**

**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J.** **O’Donoghue**

**I will ask at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council in conjunction with**

**Irish Water provide all relevant information for a full breakdown on the issue of the**

**boil water notice in Fedamore village: (1) When and what was detected for the boil**
---
5

**notice to be put in place (2) How many houses/people are affected (3) What has been**

**done to date to bring this to a resolution and (4) When will it be resolved.**

Councillor O’Donoghue noted that the response from Irish Water did not include a reply

to when the boil notice was put in place.

**Reply:**

Please note below the response received from Irish Water after the

meeting of the 9th November 2021.

“The boil water notice was issued as a result of an increase in turbidity, or cloudiness, in

the raw water coming from the underground source that supplies the area. This means

that adequate disinfection of the water cannot be guaranteed, and so the water should

be boiled before use. The notice affects approximately 500 people. Irish Water has

developed a new borehole in line with best practice, additionally a new filtration

treatment system has been installed to bring the water supply up to Drinking Water

Regulations. This treatment unit is currently at commissioning stage.

In our recent press release (enclosed below) we gave a timeframe of six months before

all works would be completed. During this time, Irish Water will be consulting with the

HSE on the water quality results and at what stage it will be possible to lift the boil water

notice.”

**Press Release** **–** **Boil Water Notice update for residents in Fedamore Friday, 15**

**October, 2021**

A Boil water Notice remains in place for the Fedamore Public Water Supply due to

ongoing issues with the quality of the water source. Irish Water is carrying out ongoing

works to resolve this as soon as possible. Irish Water and Limerick City and County

Council fully acknowledge the impact and inconvenience caused by this restriction for

homes and businesses in the area. Speaking about the Boil Water Notice, Water Lead

for Co. Limerick Duane O’Brien said:

*“We wish to thank the community for their ongoing patience and assure them*

*that we are working towards resolving the issue as soon as it is safe to do so. We*

*understand and acknowledge the difficulty that living with a boil water notice*

*causes for homes and businesses. However, this is a necessary measure to*

*protect public health.”*

The Boil Water Notice was issued as a result of an increase in turbidity, or cloudiness, in

the raw water coming from the underground source that supplies the area. This means

that adequate disinfection of the water cannot be guaranteed, and so the water should

be boiled before use.

“*Irish Water are continuing to progress with works to allow this Boil Water Notice*

*to be lifted. In recent months, a new water filtration treatment system has been*

*installed and is presently at commissioning stage. Works are also being*

*undertaken to connect the Fedamore Water Supply Scheme to an adjoining group*
---

*scheme which will provide future resilience during drought or interruptions. The*

*final element of works, which will allow Irish Water to seek the removal of the Boil*

*Water Notice, requires the construction of several hundred metres of pipeline*

*from the treatment plant. These corrective measures are being prioritised and are*

*all scheduled* *to be completed in approximately six months.”*Duane added.

Updates will be available on our Water Supply Updates section on water.ie, on

Twitter @IWCare and via our customer care helpline, open 24/7 on 1800 278 278.

Further information is available from https://www.water.ie/water-suppy/water-

quality/boil-water-notice/ Irish Water continues to work at this time with our Local

Authority partners, contractors and others to safeguard the health and well-being of

both staff and the public and to ensure the continuity of critical drinking water and

wastewater services. Irish Water is responsible for the delivery of all public water and

wastewater services in Ireland. We are committed to continuously upgrading and

developing critical infrastructure to support the growth needed in housing and across

our economy, while protecting the environment and safeguarding water supplies.

Boil Water Notice advice: Water must be boiled for:  Drinking  Drinks made with

water  Preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating

 Brushing of teeth  Making of ice - discard ice cubes in fridges and freezers and

filtered water in fridges. Make ice from cooled boiled water. What actions should be

taken:  Use water prepared for drinking when preparing foods that will not be cooked

(e.g. washing salads)  Water can be used for personal hygiene, bathing and flushing of

toilets but not for brushing teeth or gargling  Boil water by bringing to a vigorous,

rolling boil (e.g. with an automatic kettle) and allow to cool. Cover and store in a

refrigerator or cold place. Water from the hot tap is not safe to drink. Domestic water

filters will not render water safe to drink  Caution should be taken when bathing

children to ensure that they do not swallow the bathing water  Prepare infant feeds

with water that has been brought to the boil once and cooled.

Do not use water that has been re-boiled several times. If bottled water is used for the

preparation of infant feeds it should be boiled once and cooled.

Bottled water can also be used to make up infant formula. All bottled water, with the

exception of natural mineral water, is regulated to the same standard as drinking water.

It is best not to use bottled water labelled as ‘Natural Mineral Water’ as it can have high

levels of sodium (salt) and other minerals, although it rarely does. ‘Natural Mineral

Water’ can be used if no other water is available, for as short a time as possible, as it is

important to keep babies hydrated. Great care should be taken with boiled water to

avoid burns and scalds as accidents can easily happen, especially with children.

All available units have been allocated.

Of the seven units requiring major refurbishment:

form part of later tender calls once funding is secured for the works.

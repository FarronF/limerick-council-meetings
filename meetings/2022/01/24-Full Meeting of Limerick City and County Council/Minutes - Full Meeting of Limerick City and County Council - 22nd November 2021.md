Update - King John’s Castle

With the consent of the Mayor and Elected Members, the Director, Community, Tourism and

Culture gave an update to the Members in relation to King John’s Castle. He explained that a

due diligence process, in relation to the proposed taking over of the running of King John’s

Castle from Shannon Heritage, had now been completed. He confirmed that there were no

major issues arising but that the date of the 4th April, 2022 was being proposed for the

proposed changeover, instead of late January 2022, to allow sufficient time to prepare for

same.

He also confirmed that Shannon Heritage would continue to operate the attraction during

this period and be open four days per week per normal opening times. He explained that a

subsidiary company, Discover Limerick DAC, would be set up by Limerick City and County

Council to take over the management of the Castle and that this company was a repurposing

of Grove Island Company, that was currently in operation.

An interim board would be established which would include some staff of Limerick City and

County Council and it was proposed that Tim O’Connor would be asked to chair the Board on

a temporary basis. The Director of Service outlined how Discover Limerick DAC would not only

assume the management of the Castle, but would also be used to promote other visitor

attractions and tourism initiatives for the city and county. He confirmed that the Department

of Housing, Local Government & Heritage was also supportive of this proposed initiative.

The Members welcomed this development, which would give reassurance to the staff

working there. They were also happy that the Castle would continue to be open for visitors

and welcomed the establishment of Discover Limerick DAC, which would promote this tourist

attraction, along with other tourist attractions across both Limerick City and County.

The Members asked to be kept fully informed and briefed on further developments in relation

to this.

Housing

Update on Housing Delivery Action Plan

Circulated, Limerick City and County Council Draft Housing Action Plan 2022-2026.

The Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non-Local Authority Housing Construction

confirmed that the Government had set a target of 300,000 homes to be delivered over the

next decade for social, affordable and cost rental, private rental and private ownership

housing, supported by over €4 billion in funding annually. She confirmed that the local

authority was required to submit its proposed Housing Action Plan 2022-2026 to the

Department of Housing, Local Government by the 17th December 2021.

She explained that the Housing Delivery Action Plan (HDAP) is Limerick’s plan to deliver the

Department target of 2,693 homes over next 5 years. This Department target for Limerick

from 2022-2026 is approximately 50% of the 1st choice need in settlements of demand, which

currently totals 5,583 qualified applicant households.

Included in the Plan is a commitment to provide an Annual Monitoring Report each year and

that there were set targets for Build, Buying (Buy and Renew), and Leasing (Repair and Lease).

The Members thanked the Senior Executive Officer, Strategy and Non-Local Authority

Housing Construction for her presentation on the Housing Delivery Action Plan. The Members

agreed that housing provision was an urgent priority for all the Elected Members across both

the city and county.

They noted the high number of qualified applicants on the Housing Waiting List and that,

overall, there was a huge demand across both the city and county for housing provision in all

categories. They agreed that while the target of 2,693 housing units was a significant increase

on the target contained in the previous Rebuilding Ireland housing Plan, that it wouldn’t meet

all those currently on the Housing Waiting List.

They agreed that there were different issues and demands across the Metropolitan and

Municipal Districts and requested that aspects of the plan relating to each District be

presented to Members at District level to ensure full consideration of the proposals.

The Members also referred to the details outlined in relation to affordable housing and stated

that, based on the various criteria and conditions that were outlined for affordable housing,

that it would be difficult for people to access in most of rural Co. Limerick, whatever about

the city areas.

They also noted the constraints in relation to water and sewage infrastructure, which would

also affect the plan, along with the shortage of building contractors and increased costs of
---
13

building supplies and materials. They also agreed that housing should be provided, where

possible, close to applicants indicated area of preference to take into account family supports,

etc.

The Director, Housing undertook to arrange separate Briefings for the Metropolitan District

and Municipal Districts in order for each District to discuss the Plan in more detail at District

level, but flagged the tight timeframe in order to meet the Departments stated timeframe of

the 17th December for the submission of the overall plan.

Egan, E. Ryan, M. Ryan, B.Teefy

**We will move at the next Meeting that the Government and the Local Authority use wool**

**produce from sheep for house, business and commercial insulation as the price is on the**

**floor at the moment. This accordingly would support farmers and the local economy.**

The Motion was adopted on the proposal of Councillor Mitchell, seconded by

Councillor Donegan.

**REPLY:**

As part of construction works, Tender Documents are issued which describe

the works to be completed. The specification document will describe a

performance requirement for building materials. In compliance with public

procurement, it is not permissible to specify a particular product type by name.

Insulation materials that satisfy the performance specification can be

nominated for use. Green procurement principles allow for wider

considerations to be incorporated into the award process but do not permit

product specific references.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to the Minister for Housing, Local**

**Government and Heritage to demand the full implementation of the recommendations of**

**the Implementation Advisory Group report in relation to the legislation for the Directly**

**Elected Mayor of Limerick.**

In proposing the Motion, Cllr Sheehan (C) stated that it had been two and a half years since

the vote in favour of a Directly Elected Mayor and that this new Office had still not been

established. He noted the important work carried out by the Implementation Advisory Group

but stated that this now needed to be established without further delay.

Cllr Sheehan (C) also proposed that the Notice of Motion be amended to also call on the

Minister to set the date for the election of a Directly Elected Mayor, details as follows:

“I will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to the Minister for Housing, Local

Government and Heritage to demand the full implementation of the recommendations of the

Implementation Advisory Group report in relation to the legislation for the Directly Elected

Mayor of Limerick and that the Minister set the date for the election of a Directly Elected

Mayor”

Proposed by Cllr Sheehan (C) and seconded by Councillor Secas.

Cllr Donegan stated that he supported the proposal for Directly Elected Member but believed

that the role was a work in progress and that not all the issues had been teased out regarding

it. Cllr Donegan proposed that the position of Directly Elected Mayor be deferred for the

moment and that it be deferred to the Local Elections due to be held in 2024. This proposal

was seconded by Councillor Mitchell.

There was discussion amongst the Members with some of the view that the Office of Directly

Elected Mayor should be established as soon as possible, whilst other Members were of the

view that the election of a Directly Elected Mayor should be deferred until the Local Elections

in 2024.

The Mayor directed that a Vote be taken on the proposal to defer the Election of the Directly

Elected Mayor until 2024.

The result of the voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillors Donegan, Egan, McSweeney, Mitchell, O’Donoghue, Ruddle, Ryan (E), Scanlan,

Sheahan (K), Sheahan (M), Slattery, Talukder, Teefy, Teskey. **(14)**

**Against**

Councillors Benson, Butler, Costelloe, Galvin, Hartigan, Keary, Kiely, Kilcoyne, Leddin, Murphy,

Novak, O’Sullivan, Secas, Sheahan (J), Sheehan (C). **(15)**

**Abstentions**

Councillors Collins (B), Collins (M), O’Dea. **(3)**

The Mayor declared that the counter proposal from the Members to defer the Election of the

Directly Elected Mayor until 2024 was defeated and that the amended Notion of Motion

proposed by Cllr Sheehan (C) and seconded by Councillor Secas was adopted.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the agenda were circulated to all Members prior

to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

12.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many playing pitches are owned by the Council and what**

**are the terms and conditions for use of these presently.**

**REPLY:**

Details in relation to numbers of playing pitches where the Council has an

ownership interest are as follows: Soccer (36 pitches); GAA (11 pitches); and

Rugby (11 pitches).

These pitches are held by Clubs under long-term Sporting Leases or Rights of

Occupation accrued due to long-term tenure of the area, subject to the area

being used for sporting purposes.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will ask at the next Meeting if a report or analysis is available, from the before and after**

**energy bills, that were collected from all houses that received a thermal upgrade, in**

**Regeneration areas.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council does not monitor actual before and after

energy bills. The objective of the Thermal Upgrade Programme is to reduce the

level of energy required to heat and run homes. Dwelling energy performance

is measured by means of a Building Energy Rating (BER). The Thermal Upgrade

Programme seeks to bring the rating of all eligible dwellings to a C Grade BER

(as set out within the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan).

14.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will ask at the next Meeting when does the Council intend to submit a proposal to the**

**Department of Housing regarding the removal of Pineview Gardens from the demolition**

**area.**
---
17

**REPLY:**

The zoning of Pineview Gardens is a matter for the Council.

The Moyross Residents’ Forum made a submission in relation to the current

proposed Pineview Gardens Open Space and Recreation zoning indicated in

the Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028, on 6th September, 2021. The

current zoning is derived from the demolition strategy, Limerick Framework

Implementation Plan, which was embedded into the statutory Limerick City

Development Plan in May 2016. The submission requests the removal of an

element of Pineview Gardens from the Open Space and Recreation zoning and

a rezoning suitable to reflect the existing residential and potential to progress

future residential.

The submission is currently being reviewed as part of the Chief Executive’s

Report on the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 and Members will have

an opportunity to consider that report ahead of a statutory consultation on

the Development Plan in February and March 2022. The final adoption of the

Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 will be determined by the Limerick City

and County Elected Members.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the use of Drones within public parks, public**

**play areas and in residential areas; what signage and where has the Council installed in**

**relation to drone flying.**

**REPLY:**

EU Regulations 2019/947 and 2019/945 governs the use of drones in Ireland

and across the European Union. There are a number of limitations for the

operation of drones. EU Regulations 2019/947 and 2019/945 define these

limits.

The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) supervises and implements the Regulation in

Ireland. The IAA also provides guidance for operating and flying drones in order

to ensure public safety. The Regulation allows registered operators and pilots

to fly their drones across the EU. Registration as a drone operator is required

if the drone used weighs over 250 grams or if it has a camera or sensor.

Those who adhere to the limits prescribed within the regulations and the EASA

safety guidance material do not need the permission of the IAA to fly a drone.

Those who wish to fly a drone outside the limits prescribed in the regulations

must apply for a Specific Operating Permission (SOP) from the IAA following

training with one of the IAA approved drone training facilities.

Regulation (EU) 2019/947, caters for most types of civil drone operations and

their levels of risk. It defines three categories of civil drone operations: the

‘open’, the ‘specific’ and the ‘certified’ category.
---
18

The ‘open’ category addresses the lower-risk civil drone operations, where

safety is ensured provided the civil drone operator comply with the relevant

requirements for its intended operation. This category is subdivided into three

subcategories, namely A1, A2 and A3. Operational risks in the ‘open’ category

are considered low and, therefore, no operational authorisation is required

before starting a flight.

The ‘specific’ category covers riskier civil drone operations, where safety is

ensured by the drone operator by obtaining an operational authorisation from

the national competent authority before starting the operation. To obtain the

operational authorisation, the drone operator is required to conduct a risk

assessment, which will determine the requirements necessary for the safe

operation of the civil drone(s).

In the ‘certified’ category, the safety risk is considerably high; therefore, the

certification of the drone operator and its drone, as well as the licensing of the

remote pilot(s), is always required to ensure safety.

The management of drone traffic will be ensured through the U-space: a set of

services that will be deployed in airspace where heavier traffic is expected,

such as in urban areas. The U-space Regulation establishes and harmonises the

necessary requirements for manned and unmanned aircraft to operate safely

in the U-space airspace, so as to prevent collisions between aircraft and to

mitigate air and ground risks. The U-space regulatory framework will provide

for safe aircraft operations in all areas and for all types of unmanned aircraft

operations. The U-space Regulation was adopted in April 2021.

The Council will consider the risks posed by the use of Drones within public

parks, public play areas and residential areas in terms of the above legislation

and the appropriate use of signage to mitigate these risks.

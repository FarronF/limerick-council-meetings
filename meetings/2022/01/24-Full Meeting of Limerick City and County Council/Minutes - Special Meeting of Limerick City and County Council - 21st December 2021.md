1.Granting of Honorary Freedom of Limerick

The Mayor welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting and stated that the Special Meeting

had been called to seek the Council’s approval to the granting of the Honorary Freedom of

Limerick to Vicky Phelan.

He outlined how the Freedom of Limerick is the highest honour that can be bestowed upon

an individual by Limerick City and County Council, and that the honour is reserved for those

who have made an exceptional or unique contribution to the common good, or to persons

who have made outstanding contributions to the life of Limerick.

He referred to the numerous messages, calls, texts and emails that he had received

regarding Vicky and the high regard that people had for her across Irish society, for her work

in uncovering the Cervical Check scandal. He also referred to her tireless support of other

women who have been affected and are fighting for justice, a fight that continues to this

day.

He also noted how Vicky has continued to face her own health challenges head-on with a

drive and determination that has garnered the respect and admiration of all, and how all of

this encapsulates the ideals of the Freedom of Limerick.

He noted that since 1877, only four women have previously received the Freedom of

Limerick, namely - Ishbel Maria Hamilton-Gordon, Countess of Aberdeen in 1884; Maud

Gonne in 1900; Kathleen Clarke in 1918 and Trudy Hunt in 1997, so this was a unique

honour being bestowed on a unique person.

The Mayor advised that he had discussed the proposal with Vicky Phelan, and he confirmed

that she had indicated that she would be honoured and delighted to accept the Freedom of

Limerick, if the Elected Members were in agreement to same.

The Members were unanimous in their support of the proposal, and they noted how Vicky

Phelan has been such an advocate for cervical cancer awareness and for women’s health in

general. They also commended her continued bravery in facing and dealing with her own

ongoing health issues and treatments. They also noted the fantastic support and care her own

family had given her over the years in dealing with all the challenges she had to face. They

also referred to Ruth Morrissey, who had also campaigned fearlessly with Vicky Phelan on the

cervical cancer scandal, who had passed away in July 2020.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Galvin, it was unanimously

agreed by all the Members that the Honorary Freedom of Limerick be conferred on Vicky

Phelan.

It was agreed that the Freedom Ceremony would take place early in 2022 in consultation with

Vicky Phelan and her family and having full regard to her health and Covid guidelines, etc.

This concluded the Meeting.

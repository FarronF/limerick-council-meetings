COVID-19. After suffering a very sharp fall in economic activity during 2020, the Limerick

economy commenced its recovery in mid-2021 as we began to open up after COVID.

While Covid-19 caused unprecedented disruption through successive lockdowns, the re-

opening of the economy this summer provided some cause for optimism for the post-

pandemic recovery.

Limerick City and County Council was proud to play its part in the national response across

many of our service areas. In relation to business supports; we distributed almost €1.4m in

the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID, and government supports have facilitated

waiving in excess of €16 million in commercial rates over the last 12 months for those

impacted.

As the economy re-entered lockdown in the first quarter of 2021, over 27,400 workers (32%

of employment) in the City and County were reliant on the Pandemic Unemployment

Payment (PUP) or Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), as businesses remained closed

due to public health restrictions.

**Outturn 2021**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2022 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

I have reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to

break-even on the Revenue Account for 2021 despite challenges faced by the Council with

the Covid-19 global pandemic. There is pressure on a number of income heads and ongoing

controls on expenditure are in place.

**Budget 2022**

The Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the

overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory,

contractual, legal and other obligations.

It incorporates the decisions made by the Council in relation to the Local Property Tax and

General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocations. The budget proposes no increase in the Annual

Rate of Valuation for commercial ratepayers. The proposed budget schemes such as the SME

scheme, tourism scheme, business and retail incentive scheme, & vacancy refund scheme are

retained to assist many key sectors of our economy.

Under the Local Government Act, 2001 as amended, the Draft Budget is required to set out

the expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the Council and the income estimated

to accrue to the Council. The budget is underpinned by our Corporate Plan that supports the

overall budget strategy

**Despite Covid-19, The Economic Outlook for Limerick continues to be positive.**

Limerick received some early good news with major announcements by the Bon Secours and

UPMC Hospital groups creating over 500 new jobs between them. This is in addition to jobs

announcements later in the year by Bosch and Legato and very positive announcements by

many companies including Edward Lifesciences, Regeneron, Transact Campus, 4Site,

Screwfix, AMCS, Takumi and Kneat.

A very welcome boost was the announcement by Government of €116 million in funding

under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund for key city-centre projects including

Cleeve’s Riverside Campus, the digital accelerator and a new city-centre footbridge.

Construction work commenced on the Opera Centre site, public realm work on O’Connell

Street, the Rugby Experience and Bishops Quay delivering a timely boost to our city-centre.

This year our Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 went out to public consultation

setting out our blueprint for the development of Limerick over the next six years.

We also completed our review of the Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan that will guide

our economic recovery from COVID.

The budget also supports the continued implementation of Limerick’s new brand identity &

strategy to internationalise Limerick as an investment and tourism destination and it is

creating a new narrative & perspective for Limerick.

**Place-Making and Public Realm Department**

I introduced a new organisational structure, which came into effect on 1st July 2021. This

restructuring responded to international, national and local priorities including climate

change, housing, regeneration and the importance of creating quality places where people

want to live, work, play and learn in. The creation of the Place-Making and Public Realm

Department responds directly to the heightened appreciation of the importance of quality

spaces and public places in the built and natural environment.

**Climate Action**

The recently enacted Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021

gives legal recognition to the commitment to achieve a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030;

provides for the introduction of carbon budgets; and provides that each local authority must

develop a Climate Action Plan within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The Plan will

incorporate actions across all Directorates of the organisation to ensure that the Council

contributes to achieving its share of the national emissions reduction targets. The

development of the Council’s Climate Action Plan will begin in 2022.
---

Provision has been made in Budget 2022 to advance studies and schemes which will allow the

Council to prepare to meet the targets set out under national climate change policy, including

building the resilience of the organisation to respond to climate change events, the promotion

of green infrastructure and biodiversity, increased energy efficiency.

**Infrastructure**

Going forward across Limerick, there will be a new emphasis on connectivity and hybrid

working as we emerge from the pandemic. Infrastructure investment is not only about

helping people to move around; considerable investment is also required to reduce carbon

emissions, either by facilitating remote working through broadband investment or

decarbonising transport networks or providing funding to make homes more sustainable.

The pandemic has accelerated this agenda and is likely to boost investment levels over the

medium term. €17 million in new funding has been allocated by the National Transport

Authority to sustainable transport projects in Limerick in 2021; while in the long-term, the

implementation of the Limerick Shannon Transport Strategy and the Colbert Station

redevelopment will be vital to facilitate population growth in the City and wider Mid-West

region.

Provision in the budget is also made to progress key infrastructure projects such as the Foynes

to Limerick route, the Cork to Limerick Motorway, the O’Connell Street urban renewal project

and many others.

We are working with The Land Development Agency on master planning public lands around

Colbert Station for a new mixed-use residential district that could accommodate up to 5,000

people and other exciting developments are under discussion.

The Limerick Greenway is Limerick’s largest outdoor tourism amenity and was officially

opened on 5th November. The multimillion-euro Greenway has attracted almost a quarter

of a million visitors since it opened to the public on 5th November.

In addition, the Development of shared e-workspaces for the County Limerick led by Innovate

Limerick has seen new projects for NCW & Abbeyfeale.

**Community**

Budget 2022 will actively allow for the further engagement with and support of our

communities. It will address enhancing quality of life for our citizens by supporting new public

realm projects & programmes across the City & County in our libraries, galleries, museums,

cultural and arts centres and across events. It also will continue a focus on dereliction/vacancy

and delivery of public realm improvements in our urban areas and villages that will animate

the public space and support place-making activities.
---

**Housing**

The budget will also help us deliver on targets set out across the four pathways within the

‘Housing for All’ Plan. It will enable & improve our own social housing stock and aid in tackling

homelessness and support the regeneration programme.

**Operations**

Operationally, the budget will allow us to meet our commitments to continue the delivery of

essential and statutory services in housing maintenance, roads, libraries, fire services. It will

allow us to be efficient, effective and committed to providing services that will underpin a

growing and dynamic Limerick. The professionalism, commitment and determination of staff

to react to unforeseen events was again demonstrated in 2021.

**Capital Programme**

The budget also makes clear our Capital Works Program for the next three years - 2022-2024,

which is included with Budget Documentation. This programme is wide-ranging over the 3

year period for a wide mix of key public projects for Limerick and is projected to cost €1.2B

which is funded from a number of sources, including own resources, national programmes

grant schemes and debt financing.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the draft budget 2022, which has benefitted from very significant feedback

from members in the Budget process, has committed to maintain service delivery in the face

of severe socio-economic challenges and the member’s decision to vary the rate of LPT has

facilitated this commitment.

This budget builds on past budgets that consolidated our council finances and allowed for the

innovative delivery of many services, programmes and projects that have set Limerick apart

as an enviable location to live in, invest in and visit.

Finally, Mayor, I would like to thank you and the elected members for all your assistance and

guidance in framing the budget. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Management

team and their senior teams for their commitment and hard work in preparing this budget.

Special thanks goes to all the finance team for the dedicated work and support in drafting &

presenting the budget, which I am sure you would agree, is exemplary.

In conclusion, he recommended the draft Budget, as presented, to the Members for adoption.

**It was unanimously agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Budget 2022, as**

**circulated to Members, would be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:**

**Introduction**
---
6

The Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December 2022 has been prepared,

circulated to Members and public notice of the Budget Meeting placed in the press, in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014.

Circular Fin 16/2021 refers to the prescribed period that applies for the holding of the 2022

Budget meeting for Local Authorities as follows: 1st November 2021 to 30th November 2021.

It was agreed by the Members at the September Council Meeting to hold the statutory Annual

Budget Meeting on Friday 26th November 2021 at 1.30pm, at Millennium Theatre, TUS,

Moylish Campus. Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, provides that the Budget must be adopted within a period of

14 days beginning on the day on which the local authority budget meeting meets. The Budget

therefore must be adopted by 10th December 2021.

**Budget Process**

The budget process for the preparation, consideration and adoption of the budget requires

statutory compliance with a number of steps, which can be summarised as follows:

***Step 1 - Decision by the Council on the adjustment factor to the Local Property Tax (LPT)***

***following a public consultation process.*** This decision was made at the Council Meeting on

5th July to leave the LPT adjustment factor at the 2021 levels.

***Step 2 - Allocation of the General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation (GMA).The Draft*

*Budgetary Plan was considered at the following meetings:*

Metropolitan District of Limerick

18th October

Adare / Rathkeale Municipal District

3rd November

Cappamore / Kilmallock Municipal District

4th November

Newcastle West Municipal District

20th October

***Step 3 - Consultation with the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) and adoption of the Draft***

***Budget by Council.*** Initial CPG meeting held on 28th June in advance of the LPT variation

decision. Budget Strategy presented to CPG Meeting held on 20th September, with further

meeting held on 15th November. The Statutory Budget Meeting is scheduled for 26th

November with a budget workshop with Councillors to be held on 23rd November.

***Step 4 - Consideration and adoption of the schedule of Municipal works by each of the***

***Metropolitan / Municipal Districts.*** These meetings will be convened in early 2022 following

the adoption of the Budget.

***Step 5 - Consideration and adoption of the Service Delivery Plan.*** The 2022 Service Delivery

Plan will be presented to Council at the January 2022 Council meeting.

Through consultation with the Corporate Policy Group and consideration of the views of

Council as expressed through the different stages of the budgetary process, in particular as
---

expressed through the meetings of the Municipal/Metropolitan Districts, the budget as

presented considers this feedback in a reasoned and balanced manner.

At the Statutory Budget Meeting, the Members will be asked to make the following decisions:

 Adopt the Budget with or without amendment.

 Determine the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV).

 Determine the proportion of Rates Refund applicable on vacant commercial premises.

**National Economic Outlook**

It is just over a year-and-a-half since the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic triggered

massive upheaval in the global economy. Since then, the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on

societies everywhere with, across the world, over 4½ million lives lost due to the virus.

While the pandemic itself is changing due to the vaccination programme, both domestically

and in other advanced economies, several economic aftershocks are now being felt.

Disruption to supply chains, higher energy prices, labour market shortages in some sectors

and a pick-up in inflation have become a feature of many economies. If sustained, these side

effects of the pandemic could potentially slow the global recovery, an outcome to which the

Irish economy would not be immune.

After recording an Exchequer deficit of €12.3 billion last year, a further deficit of €12.1 billion

is in prospect this year. Even with economic recovery, the Exchequer is projected to run

another large deficit of €7.7 billion in 2022.

Public indebtedness has increased significantly, as the Government has used its balance sheet

to absorb the pandemic-induced shock to economic activity. At the end of this year, gross

public debt is estimated at €236.7 billion, the equivalent of 106.2 per cent of modified

national income/GNI (Gross National Income). Relative to pre-pandemic levels at end-2019,

this is an increase of 11.5 percentage points of GNI. Further public debt accumulation is in

prospect for next year. Based on current expectations for the headline deficit, the stock of

outstanding public indebtedness is projected to increase to €238.7 billion by end-2022; this

would result in a debt-GNI ratio of just over 99.2 per cent. By the mid-part of this decade, the

economic and fiscal projections outlined earlier imply gross public debt amounting to around

€252 billion by end-2025. Allowing public debt to temporarily increase was the most

appropriate way of cushioning the impact of the pandemic.

The need for a medium-term orientation for budgetary policy is further reinforced by the

ageing of the population, which will involve significant fiscal costs. Financing the ‘two

transitions’ – the transition to carbon (net-) neutrality and the transition to a digitised

economy – will also absorb much of the resources generated by the economy in the years

ahead. These resources are currently flattered by exceptionally strong corporation tax

receipts, which are unlikely to persist. The revenue-at-risk from international corporation tax

changes is tentatively estimated at around €2 billion per annum (c.1 per cent of modified

national income) from the mid-part of this decade, and budgetary policy must be formulated

based on this permanent revenue loss.
---

A perfect storm has given rise to a pick-up in both headline and core inflation since the spring,

a feature of almost all advanced economies at this point. Amid tight supplies and growing

demand on foot of economic recovery, higher energy prices have pushed the headline

inflation rate higher. More fundamentally, a mismatch between demand and supply in some

markets has been behind the increase in ‘core’ (i.e. excluding energy and food prices)

inflation.

Overall, employment growth of 7¾ per cent is expected for the year (c. 150,000 jobs), with

the unemployment rate approaching 9 per cent by year-end. For next year, employment

growth of just over 13 per cent (c. 275,000 jobs) is projected, with particularly strong growth

in part-time employment assumed. On this basis, the number at work is expected to return

to its pre-pandemic level in the mid-part of 2022, with the unemployment rate expected to

fall to 6½ per cent by the end of next year.

**Local Outlook**

It has been a tough 12 months for everyone, especially our business community who have

had to operate within severe restrictions as we all learned to live with COVID-19. After

suffering a very sharp fall in economic activity during 2020, the Limerick economy

commenced its recovery in mid-2021 as we began to open up after COVID.

While Covid-19 caused unprecedented disruption through successive lockdowns, the re-

opening of the economy this summer, as well as building back better and more sustainably,

provided some cause for optimism for the post-pandemic recovery.

As the economy re-entered lockdown in the first quarter of 2021, over 27,400 workers (32%

of employment) in the City and County were reliant on the Pandemic Unemployment

Payment (PUP) or Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), as businesses remained closed

due to public health restrictions.

Government support for employees and businesses helped to ease the burden of these

severe restrictions while state agencies worked with bringing the virus under control. Limerick

City and County Council was proud to play its part in the national response across many of

our service areas and in relation to business supports; we distributed almost €1.4m in the

Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC1 and SBASC2) and government supports

have facilitated waiving in excess of €16 million in commercial rates over the last 12 months

for those impacted. Limerick received some early good news with major announcements by

the Bon Secours and UPMC Hospital groups creating over 500 new jobs between them. This

is in addition to jobs announcements later in the year by Bosch and Legato and very positive

announcements by many companies including Edward Lifesciences, Regeneron, Transact

Campus, 4Site, Screwfix, AMCS, Takumi and Kneat.

A very welcome boost was the announcement by Government of €116 million in funding

under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund for key city-centre projects including

Cleeve’s Riverside Campus, the digital accelerator and a new city-centre footbridge. This year

our Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 went out to public consultation setting out

our blueprint for the development of Limerick over the next six years. We also completed our

review of the Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan that will guide our economic recovery

from COVID. Construction work commenced on the Opera Centre site, public realm work on

O’Connell Street, the Rugby Experience and Bishops Quay delivering a timely boost to our

city-centre. The vaccination programme and government’s roadmap to reopen retail and
---
10

hospitality provided us with a pathway out of lockdown, and this has restored our freedom

to travel and enjoy our city and town centres. As Limerick reopened, it was important that

we all shopped locally to support local business and jobs. While many of our key index figures

declined during Covid, they have started to stabilise over the last six months as we all look

forward to a continued recovery in our economy. Economic data also reflects the resilience

of many sectors of Limerick.

Limerick is performing relatively well compared to other counties during COVID-19, with the

predominance of remote-enabled sectors in the City more resilient to the disruption of the

pandemic. Reflecting the national picture, the housing market has also remained resilient,

with price rises in the City and county and lower residential vacancy rates pointing to

continued strong demand, outpacing that of Dublin and other cities.

Going forward across Limerick, there will be a new emphasis on connectivity and hybrid

working as we emerge from the pandemic. Infrastructure investment is not only about

helping people to move around; considerable investment is also required to reduce carbon

emissions, either by facilitating remote working through broadband investment or

decarbonising transport networks or providing funding to make homes more sustainable. The

pandemic has accelerated this agenda and is likely to boost investment levels over the

medium term. €17 million in new funding has been allocated by the National Transport

Authority to sustainable transport projects in Limerick in 2021; while in the long-term, the

implementation of the Limerick Shannon Transport Strategy and the Colbert Station

redevelopment will be vital to facilitate population growth in the City and wider Mid-West

region.

While the workplace of the future will look different to pre-Covid, offices will continue to

remain necessary for collaboration and knowledge sharing, and urban centres vital for the

clustering of economic activity. The development of the Shannon Estuary as a renewable

energy hub and the €73m in redevelopment funding for Limerick City Waterfront are the

standout investments that will benefit the local economy in the near term. Businesses will

also need to adapt to continued public health restrictions while public spaces are being re-

imagined as attractive spaces for people to revitalise urban centres. At a local level, the

hospitality sector has been facilitated to operate outdoors through the waiving of licence fees

and grants to purchase outdoor equipment, taking advantage of the summer and seasonal

‘staycations’ in Ireland. With continued fiscal support, the recovery phase should look very

different to the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago.

Limerick City and County Council will continue to support its citizens and business community

to ensure that as we emerge from COVID, future growth is sustained and sustainable.

Limerick City and County Council established a COVID-19 Community Response Team in 2020.

The work of this team continued throughout 2021 dealing with calls and referrals and

providing necessary supports.

**Budget Strategy & Objectives**

The Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the

overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory,

**Outturn 2021**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2022 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

The Annual Financial Statement of Limerick City and County Council for the year 2020 shows

the accumulated balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit position of €887,563. I have

reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to break-

even on the Revenue Account for 2021 despite challenges faced by the Council with the Covid-

19 global pandemic; however there is pressure on a number of income heads and ongoing

controls on expenditure are in place. The impact of the windfarm appeals has been

highlighted to members and this could impact adversely in achieving a balanced outturn. The

2022 draft Budget reflects the need to continue a strong financial management ethos while

making every effort to meet the ever-increasing demands on the services of Limerick City and

County Council.

**Analysis of Expenditure Requirements 2022**

The total estimated expenditure included in the Draft Budget for 2022 amounts to €952.232

million, an increase of €95 million on the adopted figure for 2021. The growth in the HAP

transactional Shared Service Centre accounts for the majority of this increase. As this

expenditure is matched by an increase in corresponding income, it has no net effect on the

Budgetary Provisions. The following Table 2 depicts Revenue expenditure by Division.

**Goods and Services Income**

Goods and Services income excluding HAP income for Draft Budget 2022 is €55.340m and is

noted in Table D. This includes income headings such as income from single differential rent

scheme of €16.65m for Budget 2022 (increase of €700k on Budget 2021). Income from Irish

Water is also accounted for under this heading with Budget 2022 at €12.97m. Other income

sources noted under Goods and Services include:

 Planning Fees income of €0.87m noted for Budget 2022 (compared to €0.69m in

Budget 2021).

 Parking Fines & Charges with income of €2.1m noted for Budget 2022 (compared to

€1.9m in 2021).

One key assumption noted in Budget 2022 is that reduced compensation of Euro 300k from

central Government will be received in 2022 for loss of income in Goods and Services due to

Covid-19 restrictions (this compensation is noted under Grants & Subsidies for Budget 2021

was for €1.05m).

**Grants and Subsidies Income**

Grants and Subsidies income excluding HAP income for Draft Budget 2022 is €68.427m and is

noted in Table E. Some of the key income sources under this heading include:

 Road Grants are assumed to remain at 2021 levels.

 Compensation for increases in rates of pay and PSPR resulting from the unwinding of

FEMPI legislation and increases in pay and pensions relating to the Public Sector

Stability Agreement noted at €6.44m in Draft Budget 2022 (increase of €1.33m

compared to 2021 due to pay increases in 2021).

**Local Property Tax Allocation 2022**

Local Property Tax (LPT) is now a key funding source for Local Government replacing the

General Purpose Grant funding allocation. The initial allocation under this funding heading

was confirmed as €17,554,464. The basis of this funding is an allocation of 80% of the LPT

collected from property owners in the City and County and retained by the Local Authority

with the remaining 20% being paid into an equalisation fund from which payments are made

to Counties not achieving a level of funding equivalent to the 2013 General Purpose Grant

(GPG) through their own LPT receipts.

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 and associated Regulations permits the Members of

the Council to vary the Rate by a maximum increase or decrease of 15%. The Council decided

to adjust the LPT rate upwards by 15% in 2022 equating to an increase of €2,398,043. The

revaluation process commenced during October/ November 2021 and detailed information

on new yields will not be available for Budget 2022, but the Department have confirmed LPT

allocations for 2022 to Limerick City and County Council via Circular Fin 18/2021.

**Commercial Rates**

Commercial Rates is a significant contributor to the total budgeted income for the Council

and it is vital to the level of service delivery that income from this source is maximised. In this

respect, it is critically important that the Valuation Office reverts promptly with new

valuations during 2022. Limerick City and County Council will continue to ensure that all

commercial properties in the City and County are included on the rates records and are

properly rated.

Due to COVID-19, 2021 has been a very challenging year for the Council’s Ratepayers. But

supports from central government have aided businesses including:

 Scaled back Rates Waiver scheme during 2021 which was further restricted in Quarter

4, 2021 to the Hospitality sector.

 Local Authority support schemes (SME & Tourism)

There are still outstanding appeals from Windfarms to be adjudicated by the Valuation

Tribunal, which could result in further financial losses from reduced Commercial Rates of

€700k per annum (arrears of €4.2m).

This financial loss in Commercial Rates for 2022 due to the windfarms’ appeals and reduction

in the global valuations of some utilities has been part mitigated by the Council receiving some

Rates buoyancy in Commercial Rates.

**Vacant Property Scheme 2022**

Section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives the power to the members of local

authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas

within the overall administrative area of the local authority.

Article 29 of the Local Government (Financial & Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provides

that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be decided at the statutory annual budget

meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area

shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The budget has been

framed on the basis the refund rates on vacant property noted in ***Table 6*** below.

The following amended vacant property scheme is proposed to continue in 2022:

**Band**

**% Refund**

**Table 6: Proposed Vacant Property Scheme 2022**

**Small and Medium Business Support Scheme 2022 (SME Scheme)**

The proposed Small and Medium Business Support scheme will pay a financial support to

occupiers of commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €25,000 but not less than €1 in 2022. The proposed % support for 2022 rates is 9%

subject to a maximum refund of €1,000, which will be subject to a number of terms and

conditions, including 25% of arrears, must be paid in year 1 to qualify for the scheme with a

payment plan in place over years 2 to 4 for the remaining arrears.

**Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2022**

The Proposed Tourism Sector Support Scheme for 2022 will be a financial support/reduction

to occupiers of commercial properties directly linked to the Tourism Sector. In order to

qualify, the total annual Commercial Rates liability must be in excess of €25,000 (Businesses

with a Rate Demand less than €25,000 already qualify for the SME Scheme 2022) and is

subject to a number of terms and conditions. The support grant payment, which is aimed

specifically at the Tourism and Hospitality Sector, will be set at 4% of the total Rates, including

arrears, up to a maximum grant payment of €5,000, for 2022 subject to the Scheme being

approved by the Council.

**Business & Retail Incentive Scheme 2022**

The Proposed Business & Retail Incentive Scheme for 2022 will continue to be available for

businesses in all towns and villages across Limerick City and County Council. The scheme is

intended to address property vacancy rates, improve streetscapes and to support the

business community.

**Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Transactional Shared Service Centre**

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is the principal platform for underpinning the

provision of housing support in Ireland and has been in operation for a number of years. HAP

is a form of social housing support provided by all Local Authorities under the Housing

(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. The availability of HAP enables all Local Authorities to

provide housing support to over 62,000 households with a long-term housing need, including

many long-term Rent Supplement recipients.

The key business processes delivered on behalf of the Local Authorities by the HAPSSC are

Tenancy Processing, Weekly Tenant Rent Run, Monthly Landlord Payment, Tenancy
---
21

Amendments, Debt Management, and Recoupment Management. The cost of running the

national centre is fully recouped by government.

During the Covid 19 pandemic, the HAPSSC has continued to support over 62,000 active HAP

tenancies.

The HAPSSC will administer circa 14,000 new tenancies in 2022 and process €708 million in

payments to HAP landlords and collect €177 million in differential rent from HAP tenants.

**Place-Making and Public Realm Department**

A new organisational structure came in effect on 1st July 2021. This restructuring responded

to international, national and local priorities including climate change, housing, regeneration

and the importance of creating quality places where people want to live, work, play and learn

in. The creation of the Place-Making and Public Realm Department responds directly to the

heightened appreciation of the importance of quality spaces and public places in the built and

natural environment.

**Climate Action**

The Council adopted the Limerick City and County Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in July

2019 in accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.

The recently enacted Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021

gives legal recognition to the commitment to achieve a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030;

provides for the introduction of carbon budgets; and provides that each local authority must

develop a Climate Action Plan within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The Plan will

incorporate actions across all Directorates of the organisation to ensure that the Council

contributes to achieving its share of the national emissions reduction targets. The

development of the Council’s Climate Action Plan will begin in 2022.

Provision has been made in Budget 2022 to advance studies and schemes which will allow the

Council to prepare to meet the targets set out under national climate change policy, including

building the resilience of the organisation to respond to climate change events, the promotion

of green infrastructure and biodiversity, increased energy efficiency.

**Limerick Greenway**

Limerick Greenway is Limerick’s largest outdoor tourism amenity and was officially opened

on 5th November. The multimillion-euro Limerick Greenway has attracted almost a quarter

of a million visitors since it opened to the public on 5th November. The 40km greenway,

which connects the towns and villages of Rathkeale, Newcastle West, Ardagh, Templeglantine

and Abbeyfeale, opened on July 1 following the completion of upgrade works. Counters

placed at strategic locations along the route show that 218,496 people visited the Limerick

Greenway since it opened. The data shows that over 70% were cyclists and there has been

overwhelmingly positive feedback from local hospitality businesses across the region. The

investment in the Limerick Greenway has provided a strategic piece of sustainable travel
---
22

infrastructure and a tourism amenity, which will support local community development

socially, culturally and economically. The local authority led the project with the support of

the Department for Rural and Community Development, the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage, the Department of Transport and Fáilte Ireland.

**General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation 2022**

Circular Fin 08/2015 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)

(Amendment) Regulations (S.I.363 of 2015), which amends the Local Government (Financial

and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 by providing that the meeting at which Municipal/

Metropolitan members consider the draft budgetary plan must conclude no later than 10

days prior to the local authority budget meeting.

Following the adoption of the budget, a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and

repairs to be carried out during 2022 in each Municipal/ Metropolitan District will be prepared

for consideration and adoption by the Municipal/ Metropolitan District Members.

The draft budget has included a general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocation of €1.403m in

total for district members, which will provide a focus and clarity as regards how the elected

members want to account for the expending of monies within their area.

**Workforce**

Recruitment of staff within the Organisation will continue and in particular will focus on the

replacement of staff following retirements, promotions and departures. A new Active Travel

unit was established in 2021 in Limerick City and County Council and will be fully funded by

the NTA.

As a major employer in the region, it is important that we provide employment opportunities

to the communities we serve. The Graph below shows our overall numbers at present and

the number of retired staff.
---

**Chart 5: Analysis of staff numbers and number receiving pensions 2015-2021 (Sept)**

**Business Improvement Department:**

The Business Improvement Unit provides support to the organisation in the assessment of

internal and external service delivery for efficiency and effectiveness. The team assists in

mapping and standardising processes ensuring the organisation is producing value for money

services that provide the best customer experience.

**Water Services/ Irish Water**

The Water Services budget now largely covers the payroll costs for 139 full time staff

equivalents and central management charges that will be recouped from Irish Water.

Materials, equipment, services, plant hire and energy are now primarily purchased through

the Irish Water procurement system and, therefore, no longer appears on the Council’s

expenditure system.

**Covid-19**

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic, Limerick City and County Council has continued

to deliver all essential services to the public.

In 2020 a Covid Crisis Management team was established and this group have met regularly

and ensured that the Council’s strategic aims are met. These include following national advice

to contain spread of COVID-19, showing leadership to staff and public as well as protection to

the Health, Safety and Welfare of Staff, Councillors and Customers.

The Covid Community Response Team, supported by our Customer Services Department,

provided an invaluable support structure to local communities.

A range of Covid-19 safe work practices have been rolled out and adopted by staff to minimise

the risk of infection. In this regard continuing to adhere to public health advice is of utmost

importance.

Council Meetings have also adapted to the circumstances to ensure adequate social

distancing and a safe environment for staff and Elected Members, while many other meetings

have moved online. The Council also holds meetings in a blended physical and online format.

**Directly Elected Mayor:**

Mr. Peter Burke TD, Minister of State for Local Government and Planning met with key

stakeholders in Limerick to discuss plans for a democratically elected Mayor. The General

Scheme of Local Government (Directly Elected Mayor with Executive Functions in Limerick

City & County) Bill 2021 was presented to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local

Government and Heritage as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process. Elected Members

and the Chief Executive made submissions on the General Scheme in July 2021.

No budgetary provision has been made in the 2022 budget for a Directly Elected Mayor on

the basis that the report recommended that any additional mandate must also have

additional means to deliver.

**Capital Budget 2022-2024**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, please find attached a report on the programme of capital

projects proposed by Limerick City and County Council for the 3 years 2022 to 2024.

A key element of the Capital Programme over the coming years is delivering on the Limerick

2030 plan. Council members agreed to the raising of a working capital loan in 2014 of €32m

and in 2017 approved loans of €170m from the European Investment Bank and Council of

Europe Development Bank to help fund this programme. In 2020, with the commencement

of the Opera Project, the Council requested and received the first drawdown of €25m from

the EIB. Also, The Rural Regeneration & Development Fund (RRDF) and the Urban

Regeneration & Development Fund (URDF) will provide funding opportunities for the Council

to develop strategic projects.

Given the fact that we are proposing allocations over 3 years, it would be unrealistic to

suggest that these allocations are definitive and are subject to funding being available in

future years. Capital projects by their very nature are flexible rolling plans, which involve an

annual review and possible adjustment. Below please find a summary of potential spend and

source of funding for the 3-year capital plan 2022 to 2024.

**Conclusion**

The Council, since its inception in 2014, has positioned itself as an ambitious, innovative,

proactive and engaged organisation to serve the people of Limerick. The transition to a

Directly Elected Mayor with executive powers is a fundamental change in local government

and will again require significant cultural change within the organisation.

The proposed Draft Budget for 2022 will maintain existing services to a high standard and

ensure that Limerick City and County Council fulfils its statutory and regulatory obligations.

The demand for services across Limerick continues to grow and this is matched by an increase

in public expectation. Our Customer Service is connected to our service catalogue, which

allows us to access the demand for services, see where the gaps are and allow us to be

proactive in allocating budgets and staffing levels that align with our citizen demands.

Limerick City and County Council will also facilitate economic development by progressing key

capital projects including Urban and Village Renewal while also marketing Limerick as a great

place to live, visit and do business.

During 2021, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events such as the Covid-19 global

pandemic, which demonstrated the professionalism, commitment and determination of staff

to manage the impact of these events.

The crisis highlighted the true nature of public service in communities across Limerick. Faced

with the challenge of social distancing, and with many of our staff working from home, we

had to deliver support and bring novel solutions to complex problems posed by the new

realities of lockdown.

With the strategic direction of our Limerick brand clear, it acted as a springboard to unite

Limerick and it became the impetus behind the highly successful local initiatives we ran during

lockdown. Moreover, unity was vital as we sought to protect the small businesses at the heart

of our communities.

Again, it was a partnership approach and a clear vision that let us move quickly and an

engaged community has given us the clarity, focus and energy to move forward and make a

difference.

In addition, I believe it is this united confidence, sense of identity and momentum that

forecasts a brighter future for Limerick as we plan for 2022.

The draft 2022 budget has been prepared with no proposed increase in Commercial Rates

ARV (Annual Rate on Valuation), and reflects the decision by elected members to maintain

the rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) at the 2021 level.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and the Elected Members for their

assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy Group in preparing

this budget.

I also wish to express my appreciation to the Management Team and their own teams for

their commitment and hard work in preparing this document. The coming year will again be

challenging, but it will offer significant opportunities.

I look forward to the full support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to be held

Friday 26th November 2021.”

The Deputy Chief Executive then provided an overview of the Budget including an overview

of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the corresponding Capital programmes.

Following the Deputy Chief Executives overview of the Budget, the Mayor confirmed that this

concluded the review of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the Members would be

afforded the opportunity for questions and answers in relation to each division. He then asked

for a Proposer for the draft Budget, as presented.

**Councillor Sheahan (J)**

Councillor Sheahan (J), speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Group, thanked the Chief Executive

and the Deputy Chief Executive and their team for the work that had gone in to the

preparation of the Budget and also thanked the Executive of the Council for their work during

the Covid pandemic. He commended the people of Limerick for their resilience during the
---
28

worst health and economic crisis the modern world has experienced. He also acknowledged

the Elected Members for the work they have done on behalf of the people of Limerick.

He referred to the cost to date of the pandemic, estimated at €40m, and referred to the high

level of national debt, which was currently at €237 billion, and the implications of this level of

debt for future budgets. He noted that the balanced budget presented by the Executive has

been made easier to balance by supports received in the form of National Grants towards the

waiving of the rates etc. He also welcomed the fact that there was no proposed increase in

commercial rates and the importance of supporting the Councils ratepayers especially during

these difficult Covid times.

Councillor Sheahan welcomed the total revenue budget of €952.23 million and the capital

budget of €378.5 million for 2022, and the provision for an overall capital budget of €1.2

billion over three years entailing a programme of capital projects proposed by Limerick City

and County Council for the period 2022 to 2024. He stated that the proposed budget would

protect the Council’s service delivery to the people. He welcomed the commitment to

continue the planned maintenance programme; to maintaining resources for the

maintenance budget to meet the ongoing demands of the social housing stock; and the

provision of match funding to address voids, dereliction and vacant properties. He also

Enforcement

investment in local projects and schemes under the General Municipal Allocation (GMA)

scheme. He noted the importance of housing delivery in the county in the years ahead and

while the Governments Housing for All policy initiative did not address all housing issues in

the county, he stressed the importance of providing a supply of additional housing in the

county to support those in need of social or affordable housing. This was also dependent on

the provision of adequate basic infrastructure such as water and sewage, which was vital for

the provision of housing to meet the demand at the current time.

maintenance, and estate management.

**Councillor Benson**

Councillor Benson, on behalf of the Sinn Féin Party, stated that this has been a very

challenging year for everybody and praised the staff for their commitment under very difficult

circumstances. She thanked the Deputy Chief Executive and his Finance team for their

patience and assistance during the Budget process.

She expressed disappointment at the resources allocated for housing maintenance, traveller

accommodation and estate management, and said that more needed to be done across the

whole area of housing, given that there was a housing crisis ongoing at the current time. She

referred to the high numbers on the Housing Waiting List and the serious shortage of housing

supply across Limerick. She also stated that housing grant funding should have been

increased having regard to the increase in building costs and lack of availability of building

contractors.

She criticised the Governments Housing for All initiative and criticised the level of expenditure

on the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)

schemes, as they would not provide any additional long-term social housing for people. She

stated that additional funding should not be allocated to private landlords but rather it be

directed towards a sustainable public housing stock.

She stressed the importance of the Council progressing housing capital projects so that they

can be delivered in a timely fashion. She also noted the lack of provision of basic sewage and

water infrastructure; recent increases in building costs; and the possible scarcity of building

contractors, which could also affect the supply of badly needed new housing.

She said that because of these reservations about aspects of the 2022 budget, that the Sinn

Féin team on the Council would not be voting in favour of this budget.

**Councillor Hartigan**

provision and that the provision of new social and affordable housing is urgently required. He

also highlighted the importance of maintaining current housing stock to the highest possible

standard. He welcomed the proposed expenditure on Active Travel measures across the city

or cycle around their areas, thereby reducing the reliance on cars. He welcomed the National

Transport Authority Bus Connect Scheme and acknowledged the importance of climate action

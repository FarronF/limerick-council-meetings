Ms. Geary thanked the Members for the opportunity to address the Meeting.

She referred to a site in Broadford which was purchased by Broadford Voluntary Housing and

Community Childcare Facility CLG., with a view to building a new housing development at the

centre of the village. She noted that the site was derelict and in need of development. She

also noted that Broadford Voluntary Housing currently manage twenty two houses and a day

care centre. She acknowledged the support of the Council with regard to these developments.

Mr. Boyce addressed the Meeting and stated that it was proposed to build seven community

houses comprising of two single bedroomed houses and five two bedroomed houses on this

site. He noted that there was a meeting with the Council in late September on this proposal.

He also noted that the Council were seeking more houses on this site and referred to an

assessment of need for community housing which was to be carried out by the Council.

Ms. Geary referred to another housing development for Broadford which was being proposed

by the Council and this relates to the building of eighteen houses on a green field site at the

edge of the village. She queried the need for eighteen houses and expressed concerns on a

number of matters including sewage capacity, water supply and the provision of a footpath

from the site to the village. She noted that no consultation had taken place with the local

community on this matter. She also noted that the group were awaiting a response from the

Council on their proposal for 7 houses following the September meeting.

Ms. Geary stated that Broadford Voluntary Group also acquired an unused quarry site a

number of years ago with a view to developing a car park, adjacent to the existing car park.

This development would alleviate traffic congestion in the village during busy periods when

traffic is parked on both sides of the road and this makes it difficult for large vehicles to get

through the village. She asked if the Council could provide assistance on this matter. She also

noted that there is a proposed private development of houses next to the quarry site where

one house is built already.

The Members thanked the delegation for their attendance and acknowledged the work of the

Voluntary Group. A discussion followed, on the Part 8 housing development for 18 houses,

the existing derelict housing development and the need for a response to the group on their

proposal to develop Nunan’s Corner. Following discussion, it was proposed that a Meeting

should be held with the relevant Directorates to discuss these matters and that further

contact should be made with representatives of Broadford Voluntary Housing by these

Directorates. It was also noted that the Councillors can decide on the Part 8 proposal once

the report on same comes before them following the conclusion of the public consultation

period.

In replying, the Director stated that with regard to the Part 8 for 18 houses in Broadford,

this proposal is currently on public display and submissions can be made. The

unfinished housing estate is being followed up by the Derelict Sites team as correspondence

has been received and is being considered. It was also noted that the Housing Directorate

wish to hold a workshop with the Newcastle West Councillors on the 8th December and the

Broadford Development at Nunan’s Corner could be raised at this.

out retrofits in the LCCC administrative area in 2023. It should be noted that the Public

Lighting teams budget is for the purpose of maintenance and does not provide for the

upgrading of existing lights. With this in mind if there are failures noted prior to the

commencement of the above contract the maintenance team will examine the

feasibility upgrading these lights.

In relation to the second part of the query, the system the Council uses (Ihouse) to capture

this data is a Live System and any changes are updated immediately so therefore there is no

historical/obsolete information stored on the system so unfortunately it is not possible to

do a comparison of this data with 2020.

Councillor Ruddle expressed concern that the figures for 2020 were not available and

queried how progress is measured from one year to another.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for the full list of the current rates across the three Housing***

***Grant Schemes, which include Housing Aid for Older People, Mobility Aid Grant and the***

***Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme.***

REPLY:

The maximum grant levels are notified to Local Authorities by the Department of Housing,

Local Government and Heritage.

**1. Housing Aid for Older People**

The Housing Aid for Older People grant covers some of the cost of work needed, but not all

of it. The amount of money an applicant gets depends on their household income for the

previous tax year. There are some disregards and deductions that can reduce the amount of

household income that the local authority takes into account.

The most an applicant can get is €8,000 or 95% of the total cost of the work approved by the

local authority (whichever is less). This grant can go towards the total cost of the work

including the VAT.
---
7

**1.Mobility Aid Grant**

The most an applicant can get is €6,000 or the total cost of the work approved by the local

authority (whichever is less). This grant can cover 100% of the cost of the work, up to a

maximum of €6,000. There are some disregards and deductions that can reduce the amount

of household income that the local authority takes into account.

A grant is not available if the household income for the previous tax year is more than €30,000

after the disregards and deductions are applied.

**2.Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability**

The Housing Adaptation Grant covers some of the cost of the work needed, but not all of it.

The amount of money an applicant gets depends on the household income for the previous

tax year. There are some disregards and deductions that can reduce the amount of household

income that the local authority takes into account.

The most an applicant can get is €30,000 or 95% of the total cost of the work approved by the

local authority (whichever is less). A grant is not available if the household income is more

than €60,000, after the disregards and deductions are applied.

A discussion took place on the Standard Unit Costs and Cllr. Sheahan noted that he had been

informed that the current rates in place maybe commercially sensitive. He noted that the

grant amounts on the application forms as outlined above were giving applicants a false

impression of what grant allocation they may be approved as this could differ when the

standard unit costs are applied. There is a need to have both the Council’s Standard Units

costs increased and also the National grant allocations as set down within the application

forms by the Department of Housing to take account of the increasing costs in the building

trade.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting when will the replication of property numbering at***

***Daar River Walk and Daar River View, Newcastle West be resolved.***

REPLY:

Daar River View is currently on the Council list for the taking in charge. Once the estate has

been taken in charge, appropriate signage can be put in place. It is expected that the estate

will be taken in charge within 4 to 6 months.

Appropriate directional signage is in place for Daar River Walk.

NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that road safety measures be put in place at Athea National***

***School.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

A pedestrian crossing is in place at Athea National School.

There are also driver feedback signs and flashing lines at the school.

The roadway is also lined and signage is in place to alert traffic that there is a

school ahead.

A discussion followed and it was noted that as all traffic calming measures have been

implemented at this location. The only other option to be considered is a loop traffic system

for drop off and collection similar to St. Fergus National School in Glin but the school would

have to agree to this and there would be a cost to them if this solution was to be considered.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council improve the sight lines at Buckley's Cross,***

***Abbeyfeale (Kilmorna Junction).***
---

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

Hedging at this junction was cut back to improve sightlines.

The following can also be carried out to further improve the sightlines within the next 3

weeks.

 Improvement in signage

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that that the Standard Unit Cost Model in respect of all***

***Housing Adaptation Grants be reviewed forthwith.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan stated that the level of grant assistance provided

for Housing Grants is inadequate due to a number of factors including escalating costs and

material shortages.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

REPLY:

The Motion is timely given material supply shortages and increasing material costs due to a

number of factors including Brexit, Covid-19, extreme weather events and global demand.

Limerick City and County Council will arrange to prepare a revised schedule of rates for

works typically funded under the grants scheme to ensure that the standard cost applied for

the grants are up to date with current building costs. The revised schedule of rates will be

arranged without undue delay.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Public Lighting at Daar River View, Newcastle***

***West, be serviced.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that the public lighting be serviced at

Daar River View, Newcastle West.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

REPLY:
---
10

It would appear that Daar River View has not been taken in charge as yet, and therefore the

responsibility for the servicing of the lighting remains with the developer.

In general where contact is made with the Council regarding issues like this in estates not

taken in charge, Planning Enforcement will write to the developer asking them to do the

necessary works.

In the Daar River View instance, Planning Enforcement will write to the developer and notify

them of the public lighting situation.

Following discussion of the Motion, a request was made that consideration be given to the

taking in charge of the lighting before the estate is taken in charge.

Following discussion on this Notice of Motion, Councillor Collins indicated he had to leave the

Meeting.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that a full review of the rates applied by Limerick City and***

***County Council to the Housing Aid for the Elderly, the Mobility Aid and the Housing Adaption***

***grants take place immediately and that Councillors be allowed participate in the review.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The motion is timely given material supply shortages and increasing material costs due to a

number of factors including Brexit, Covid-19, extreme weather events and global demand.

Limerick City and County Council will arrange to prepare a revised schedule of rates for works

typically funded under the grants scheme to ensure that the standard cost applied for the

grants are up to date with current building costs. The revised schedule of rates will be

arranged without undue delay.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan referred to the level of grant assistance provided

in the Housing Grant Schemes and requested a review of the application forms to be

undertaken.

The following items were also raised.

An update was sought on the safety measures along the R522 at Ardnacrohy, Newcastle West.

In reply, the Executive Engineer Roads, noted that the Gardai had advised that a safe location

was needed for the Go Safe Van on this roadway

It was noted that a private Virtual Briefing on the Housing Delivery Action Plan 2022 – 2066

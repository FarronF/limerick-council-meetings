the publication of the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) in
---

June 2020. It was necessary for Limerick City and County Council to await this publication

in order to develop an integrated Transport Strategy to support planned growth in the area

to 2040. Our design team are currently working closely with key stakeholders along the

route to progress this first phase of the bus corridor.

The remaining section of the Dublin Road bus corridor (Parkway Roundabout to City Centre)

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Met**ropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and***

***County Council advise when will Glenview Gardens, Farranshone be taken in charge as this***

***estate is over 50 years old.***

**REPLY**: Glenview Gardens is not in the charge of Limerick City and County Council.

Reports will now be sought from the appropriate Council departments and Irish Water in

order to assess the current condition of the estate.

When these reports are completed Limerick City and County Council will then be in a

position to determine as to whether Glenview Gardens is to a taking in charge standard.

 

7.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can Limerick City and***

***County Council advise as to what plans are in place for flood defences in the Montpelier area of***

***County Limerick.***

**REPLY**: O’Briensbridge / Montpelier was an AFA (Area for Further Assessment) included in the OPW

CFRAM Flood Risk Management Plans. This AFA was not identified as being economically

cost beneficial and did not progress as one of the areas for funding under the CFRAM

Programme.

It was noted in the FRMP that embankment works may be progressed under the Minor

Flood Mitigation Works & Coastal Protection (Minor Works) Scheme.

Embankment works have already been completed in Montpelier under the Minor Works

scheme. As part of these works, a geotechnical assessment was completed which identified

the presence of deep gravels which may allow seepage underneath the embankment. It was

concluded that the option of installing a cut-off wall to this flow path would be prohibitively

costly and that the seepage is managed, during flood events, through the use of temporary

mobile pumps.

**REPLY**: The issue of utilising disused rail lines in the city was raised following the publication of

LSMATS, Draft 1. This draft had included for some significant improvement to be made,

primarily to the inter-urban rail network serving Limerick, but had not recommended

intensification of heavy rail transport within suburban Limerick.

Following the request for more investigation of the rail options, further detailed modelling

of potential heavy rail improvements was undertaken, including for detailed Business Case

Usage and Benefit/Cost analysis. Detailed discussions on the potential of reusing parts of

the disused rail network, including new suburban rail stations, are still ongoing involving the

Council, the NTA, Iarnród Éireann and the Department of Transport. The outcome of these

discussions will influence the Rail content of LSMATS, Draft 2, which is due to be released

at beginning of 2022.

12.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what budget is currently***

***available to Limerick City and County Council for the 2022 thermal upgrade works programme***

***and what budget will be required to achieve a BER C1 grade on all of the remainder of homes in***

***the four regeneration areas that ar**e due thermal upgrade works in 2022.***

**REPLY**: The Regeneration Thermal Upgrade programme is subject to the budget approval

processes prescribed by the Capital Works Management Framework. This framework

requires the Sponsoring Agency (the Local Authority) to present business cases for

proposed projects / contracts to the funding / Sanctioning Authority (the Department of

Housing, Local Government & Heritage) for budget approval purposes. The approval

process applicable to the Thermal Upgrade programme is a two-stage approval process

with an initial approval required ahead of tendering and a second approval required upon

receipt of tenders. A preliminary budget is sanctioned on foot of the initial approval and

this is either subsequently reconfirmed or adjusted accounting for the outcome of the

ensuing tender process.

Budget approval has yet to be sanctioned in respect of those Thermal Upgrade Contract

submissions made, by the Local Authority to the Department, across the latter half of 2021.

Scoping works are still ongoing on a number of remaining Thermal Upgrade Contracts also

planned to be progressed to construction stage in 2022. The business cases for these

remaining contracts are expected to be advanced to the Department early in 2022. The

budget requirement to deliver the target energy upgrade will not be fully quantified until

the scopes of works for these residual  contracts have been finalised.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress, if any, has***

***been made to-**date to identify a site for a new cemetery in the Castletroy area.***

**REPLY**: The Council has commenced a desktop exercise of identifying sites for a new burial ground

for the Castletroy area. The Castletroy area is contained within the Ballysimon DED. The

process is at an early stage and will involve assessing sites against a defined set of criteria

before a preferred site can be identified. It is the Council’s intention to have a site identified

by mid-2022.

The need for a new burial ground to serve the Castletroy area was identified in the Burial

Ground Strategy. The approximate timeframe for the development of this new burial

ground, which will accommodate the needs of the Ballysimon DED, is set out below:

• Land Acquisition 2022 – 2023

• Develop New Burial Ground 2024 - 2026

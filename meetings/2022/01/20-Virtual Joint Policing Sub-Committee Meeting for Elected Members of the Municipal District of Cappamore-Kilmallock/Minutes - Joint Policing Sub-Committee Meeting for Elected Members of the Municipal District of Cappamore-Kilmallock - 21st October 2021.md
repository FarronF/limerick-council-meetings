It was noted that there were 140 checkpoints in the Municipal District.

Further to an incident of Anti-social behaviour in Kilmallock in September, An Garda

Siochana were praised for attending the scene immediately and taking a proactive

approach, which led to an arrest on the 5th October. It was noted that those arrested have

been charged and are on strict bail conditions.

Garda Reidy also updated the Elected Members that they had engaged with the Traveller

Mediation Service and arranged mediation between those involved.

The Elected Members were also advised of a serious incident in Ballylanders on the 14th

October, in which the Armed Support Unit were called out, and the incident was diffused

without injury. An arrest was undertaken.

An update was provided on the outcome of a serious assault in 2017 in Bruree. Two

individuals were arrested, and the trial has just concluded at which they were convicted.

It was noted that nightclubs would be opening again that weekend, and various high level

GAA matches were planned. Additional resources were being provided by An Garda

Siochana from other districts to ensure that there would be adequate cover for these

It was noted that at the time of the incident of Anti Social Behaviour in Kilmallock, the CCTV

cameras were not operational, and this has been highlighted with the Digital Head of

Strategy.

“Make Way Day”, an initiative undertaken by the Step Forward Disability Group in Hospital,

was brought to the attention of the Superintendents, outlining that the event aims to raise

awareness of ensuring that parked cars do not cause disruption to those with disabilities

navigating the footpaths.

Councillor Donegan advised the attendees that October was Crime Prevention Month with a

focus on Digital Fraud.

Superintendent Reidy also advised that the Gardai provide supports to schools in relation to

Road safety etc., and if there is an issue regarding digital images being circulated in schools,

parents can bring this to the attention of the Gardai and the DPS Unit.

A concern was raised by the Elected Members regarding drugs and their availability in

communities. It was questioned as to how it was possible to increase prevention and raise

awareness among young people of their dangers, and also to deal with the issue of

antisocial behaviour among young people and the use of and possession of dangerous

weapons e.g. slashhooks.

Superintendent Reidy advised that a new drugs unit has been established, but the

availability of drugs is still a large problem. He also highlighted that resources are being

allocated to increasing drug driving arrests, and towards education and engagement with

schools. Also that there is a need for additional resources for the Gardai, but they are

utilising the existing resources to their best use. The Garda Youth Diversion programme was

also mentioned, which deals with underage crime and prevention of criminal activity among

youth, which has proved very effective.

For first offences or for those possessing cannabis for their own use, cautions are being

issued (adults).

Any dangerous weapons used during the incident of antisocial behavious in Kilmallock have

been seized.

A suggestion was made that a presentation on the Community Alert Programme be

delivered at the next JPC meeting and the Meetings Adminstrator agreed to arrange this.

A question was raised regarding the availability of Free Legal Aid to repeat offenders, and

those found guilty. Superintendent Reidy confirmed that this was a matter for the courts to

decide.

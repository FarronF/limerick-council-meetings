To: The Mayor and Each Member of Limerick City and County Council

A Chomhairleoir, a chara,

| refer to the agenda for Meeting of Limerick City and County Council to be held on Monday,
17" July, 2023, and set out hereunder supplementary item, Item No. 22A:

22A of Motion subm by C

J. Egan and D.

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on Transport
Infrastructure Ireland (Til) to fully engage with the Irish Farmers’ Association by
agreeing a new “Acquisition of Certain Lands for National Roads” agreement between
the Irish Farmers’ Association representing landowners impacted by the forthcoming
Foynes to Adare motorway/dual carriageway. The current agreement has expired and
the lack of an ongoing agreement will likely impact timely delivery of new

infrastructure.

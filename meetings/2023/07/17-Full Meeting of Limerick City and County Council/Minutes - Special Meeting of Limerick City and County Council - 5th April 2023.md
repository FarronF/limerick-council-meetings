The Mayor welcomed all the Elected Members, Officials, members of the public and media

who were present in the Chamber and Online for the Meeting. He confirmed that the

Special Meeting had been convened to discuss the issue as set out in the proposal received

on 24th March 2023, and signed by a number of Members as follows:

“We will move at a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council, that this Council:

 Notes the recent statement by Threshold which states that “Unprecedented

numbers of adults and children could now become homeless, as a result of the

Government’s plan to lift the eviction ban for rented properties”

 Limerick City and County Council also notes the statement by Threshold that “the

organisation currently works with thousands of individuals with notices of

termination and the Coalitions decision is likely to exacerbate the concerns-and

situations-these renters find themselves in”

 Therefore, this Council will write to the Government and appeal to them to

reconsider their decision of ending the eviction ban and to liaise with all Local

Authorities during this time, to identify and provide all necessary resources required,

to assist them in increasing housing supply.

**Signed: Councillors Benson, Carey, Collopy, O’Donovan, Ryan (E), Scanlan**

The Mayor noted that he had received an amendment to the original motion and it was

proposed by Cllr. J. Sheahan, and seconded by Cllr. L. Galvin.

The amended Motion read as follows:

“We move that Thresholds comments are noted. We further propose that this

Council write to the Government to liaise with Limerick City and County Council to

expedite the measures introduced by the Government to alleviate consequences

which may arise on foot of the lifting of the temporary eviction ban”

It was the view of some Members that the original motion, proposed by Cllr. Benson and

seconded by Cllr. Sheehan (C) needed to be discussed in full before an amendment could be

proposed.

During the discussions, the Members called on the Director of Services, Housing to give an

update on the current housing supply and plans for 2023. The Director of Housing updated

the Members on the overall process to acquire accommodation and the various schemes

announced by the Government to assist with the current housing crisis.

She confirmed that Limerick City and County Council have set up supports for tenants who

have received a Notice to Quit, and she advised Members that tenants in receipt of a Notice

to Quit should come through the Local Authority for assistance. The Director of Housing

also outlined the amount of accommodation acquired in 2022 and highlighted the target for

2023, pointing out that Limerick City and County Council is on target for this year.

The Elected Members thanked the Director of Services, Housing, for her report, and the

Director of Services, Housing, addressed the Members subsequent questions and she

outlined the various supports in place for tenants, both social and private.

The Mayor then directed that a vote be taken on the proposed amendment to the original

motion, and the result of the vote was as follows:

**In Favour:**

Councillors Butler, Collins (B), Collins (M), Donegan, Egan, Foley, Galvin, Hartigan, Keary,

Kiely, McSweeney, Mitchell, Murphy, Novak Uí Chonchúir, O’Hanlon, O’Sullivan, Pond,

Ruddle, Ryan (M), Sheahan (J), Sheahan (K), Sheahan (M), Slattery, Talukder, Teskey **(25)**

and signed by a number of Members as follows:

**“We will move at a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council, that this Council:**

 **Notes** **the recent statement by Threshold which states that “Unprecedented**

**numbers of adults and children could now become homeless, as a result of the**

**Government’s plan to lift the eviction ban for rented properties”**

 **Limerick City and County Council also notes the statement by Threshold that “the**

**organisation currently works with thousands of individuals with notices of**

**termination and the Coalitions decision is likely to exacerbate the concerns-and**

**situations-these renters find themselves in”**

 **Therefore, this Council will write to the Government and appeal to them to**

**reconsider their decision of ending the eviction ban and to liaise with all Local**

**Authorities during this time, to identify and provide all necessary resources**

**required, to assist them in increasing housing supply.**

**Signed: Councillors Benson, Carey, Collopy, O’Donovan, Ryan (E), Scanlan**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Benson and seconded by Councillor Collopy.

The Mayor outlined the background to the convening of the meeting and summarised legal

advice received. He outlined this Meeting was reconvened to allow for this motion to be

moved and discussed. The Elected Members agreed based on legal advice to revoke the

Motion carried during the Special Meeting held on 5th April 2023.

Members thanked the Mayor for convening the Special Meeting and welcomed the

discussion on the motion. Some Members raised concerns over the Government’s decision

to end the eviction ban. It was the view of some Members that this decision will lead to

severe pressure on the housing system and an increase in homelessness and highlighted

that it was not too late to reverse the decision.

Members raised concerns over the number of tenants in receipt of a Notice to Quit from

their landlords, since the eviction ban was lifted. They acknowledged the Tenant in Situ

Scheme was put in place to address the issue. However, they were of the view that the lack

of resources available to the Council to deliver on this scheme will cause delays, and they

asked the Executive if anything can be done to add additional staff to the scheme.

Some Members referred to the delay in turning around local authority houses for reletting

and agreed that improvements in this area would assist those seeking housing. They agreed

that local authorities also needed to be more innovative by perhaps using modular housing

where possible to speed up the rate of construction. Some Members also stressed the

importance of supporting landlords as well as private rented accommodation was an

important element of the housing system. Members also agreed that the Land Development

Agency needed to accelerate its delivery of housing in Limerick and that they were taking

much too long in even the initial aspects of site planning and development

Members expressed their concerns over the amount of people homeless that aren’t

reporting it, and pointed out these people are not included in the report on homeless

figures.

The Director of Housing thanked the Members for their questions and confirmed that the

Council has been in contact with the Department for additional resources and advised that

the Department are looking at the request. She also acknowledged that Human Resources

are also supporting them on the matter.

The Director confirmed they are working through the list of those in receipt of a Notice to

Quit that have contacted the Council, and will do everything to support them. She pointed

out that they are working with AHB’s and highlighted that it takes time to complete a sale

with the Landlord. She confirmed they are currently working with a number of landlords

that are interested in selling.

This concluded the meeting.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Cappamore-

Kilmallock – Councillors G. Mitchell (Proposer), P.J. Carey, M. Donegan, J.

Egan, Ryan (E), Ryan (M), Teefy

**We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council correspond with**

**the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr. Charlie McConalogue, TD, requesting**

**that new fit-for-purpose legislation is introduced and enacted relating to dogs entering on**

**lands and said premises of owners which may cause injury to persons or animals, to prevent**

**distress to farmers, owners, and their animals and to counteract dog fouling. This**

**legislation should include the appointment of sufficient dog wardens to monitor, enforce**

**and follow up on reports.**

On the proposal of Councillor, Mitchell, seconded by Councillor Egan, the Motion was

adopted by the Council.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council appoint Authorised**

**Officers to deal with animal welfare issues within Limerick City and County, as per the**

**Animal Health and Welfare Act, 2013.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan and seconded by Councillor

Collopy.

**REPLY:**

Having given detailed consideration to the Notice of Motion from Councillor

O’Donovan, I would like to set out the current situation and the possible

implications of such an appointment below.

Currently the duties outlined under the Animal Welfare Act 2013 for Limerick

are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine

and An Garda Síochána. Complaints relating to Animal Welfare received by the

Council are routed to these organisations as appropriate.

Under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, the Minister may appoint

authorised officers or appoint by way of Service Level Agreement an

organisation to carry out functions under the Act, e.g. The Irish Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA). A local authority may also appoint

an authorised officer for its functional area.

An Garda Síochána has, through Sections 39 and 40 of the Act, the powers of

authorised officers and may enforce provisions of the Act and execute arrest

without warrant on finding suspected breeches of the Act.

The Department of Agriculture investigates cases under the Animal Cruelty Act

2013 through its Divisional Veterinary Officers supported by a national

investigation team. A recent review by the Department concluded that to

perform its duties effectively under this Act, “*a core group of highly-skilled and*
---
19

*trained investigators is needed to carry out any type of investigation to the*

*standard required for court.**”*

This inspection/investigative capability is supplemented by a Central

Investigations Division. The Investigations Division’s remit is to carry out

investigations and enquiries across all areas of the Department. The team is

multidisciplinary and the mix of staff expertise and backgrounds in the staffing

complement reflects the nature and focus of the work. There are no plans to

reduce the staff numbers in the Division.

The appointment of an Animal Welfare Officer under the Act may necessitate

an investment in subsequent services and facilities. There would be associated

veterinary costs with any operation. It may also necessitate the provision of

facilities for any seized animals either directly or on behalf of the Council. The

costs relating to these activities, which would include security costs for the

facility, could increase substantially. It is likely that as the Department has

already provided these services, the Department would not recoup these

costs.

The issues involved in the appointment of such an officer are wide and

complex. An Garda Síochána and the Department of Agriculture, Food and

the Marine have extensive powers under the Act. These resources are far in

excess of what the Local Authority could provide.

The budget costs in relation to the provision of such duties would likely be a

multiple of any salary costs and would not significantly add to the resources or

powers available to the carrying out of the duties under the Act. An

appropriate budget for any proposed services and facilities would need to be

provided for in the Annual Budget. Sanction would also be required from the

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage where a new post is

created.

Following discussions, the Members requested that a private Workshop be organised,

comprising officials of Limerick City and County Council, An Garda Siochana, the Dept

of Agriculture, the ISPCA and other local groups involved in animal welfare issues,

where animal welfare issues could be discussed.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

**I will move at the next Meeting that a full review of parklets and build-outs be undertaken**

**to ascertain their necessity and current use.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor McSweeney.

**REPLY:**

The Council is currently preparing a City Centre Public Realm Strategy. This

strategy will include a review of the condition of the existing streetscape and

will bring forward proposals to enhance our public areas and green spaces. As

part of this review, a cross-departmental team has been convened to review
---
20

all street furniture including the parklets and build-outs put in place by the

Council as a response to the COVID pandemic.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Egan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council correspond with the**

**President of the GAA to request that championship matches be aired on terrestrial**

**television free of charge.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Egan and seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan.

Members were unanimous in their support and agreed that many people had been unable to

view some recent high profile fixtures, as they were only available to view via an Online

subscription. They agreed that this was unfair on all those who could not access the

technology and who had paid their TV Licence fee, and that this new approach would not help

in the promotion of GAA sports to the wider community.

Councillor Teefy proposed an amendment to the Motion to read as follows:

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council correspond with the**

**President of the GAA to request that championship matches be aired on terrestrial**

**television free of charge, and also that admission to GAA fixtures facilitate cash payment at**

**match venues for ticket purchases and not just solely by Online ticket payment.**

The amended Motion was seconded by Councillor Egan and agreed.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond ***(to be referred to***

***Metropolitan District of Limerick)***

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would, as a matter of**

**urgency, engage with National Parks & Wildlife, Waterways Ireland and any other**

**stakeholders to ensure that the pontoon that is located on the Shannon at Montpellier is**

**retained to continue allowing access to the water for residents and visitors, including**

**Dragon Boat personnel.**

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Metropolitan District of Limerick for

consideration.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

**I will move at the next Meeting, as the LAMA Representative on this Council, that Minister**

**Simon Harris would immediately revisit the Higher Education Bill of 2022 to include the**

**automatic inclusion of Local Authority Elected Members on the boards of Higher Education**

**Boards.**

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C), the

Motion was adopted.

**Suspension of Standing Orders:**  It was noted that the time was approaching 5.30 p.m., and

on the proposal of Councillor Collins (B), seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), Standing Orders

were suspended in order to complete the agenda.

18.

Correspondence

The Correspondence circulated with the agenda was taken as read.

**Foynes/Shannon Estuary Water Supply** **–** **Boil Water Notice**

With the permission of the Mayor, Members raised the issue of the recently announced boil

water notice from Uisce Eireann, which was affecting approximately 7,000 consumers

served by the Foynes/Shannon Estuary Public Water Supply.

Members noted that Uisce Eireann had advised that customer’s on the Foynes/Shannon

Estuary public water supply have been on a boil water notice since the 13th May, following

the detection of cryptosporidium in the water supply. The area affected stretches from

Kildimo to Foynes and includes the towns of Askeaton, Pallaskenry, Shanagolden,

Ballyhahill, Loghill, Ballysteen and surrounding areas.

Uisce Éireann had also advised that it was progressing with plans to install an ultraviolet

reactor at the Shannon Estuary Water Treatment Plant. This reactor will render any

cryptosporidium in the water inactive but was a large piece of equipment and required a

significant amount of accommodation works in advance of its installation.

Members agreed that the protection of public health was the priority but expressed deep

frustration at the likely time delay before the ultraviolet reactor would be in place and

operational. They called on Uisce Eireann to prioritise and complete these works as soon as

possible. Members also noted that a Special Meeting of the Adare Rathkeale Municipal

District was being convened later in the week to meet with officials from Uisce Eireann to

discuss the issues involved and to emphasise the importance of completing the required

works as soon as possible.

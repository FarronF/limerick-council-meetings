**10.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next**Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the Council to present***

***its policy on dealing with reports of attacks on people by dogs in public places.***
---
4

**REPLY**: There is no formal policy for the investigation of dog attacks.

The practice is as follows:

On receipt of a complaint, an investigation is commenced. Firstly, our wardens will try to

establish the name and address of the dog owner. This is the first step required to be able

to follow up with any enforcement action. If this cannot be established the case is closed.

If the name and address can be established then the wardens will take statements from

both the complainant and owner.

Our wardens must gather evidence if they did not witness the incident themselves.

In order to issue fines, the same level of evidence is required as if we are going to Court.

Similar to litter fines, hearsay or oral statements are of no evidentiary value.

In relation to a dog attack, we require a written statement from the complainant. We also

ask them to report the matter to Gardaí and to send us a medical report if they have had to

receive medical treatment. These all help us to build our case, provide the evidence to issue

fines and prosecute the case in court if necessary.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many attacks on***

***people by dogs have been reported to Limerick City and County Council for the years 2021, 2022***

available on-street bike parking in conjunction with the NTA programme.

There are currently no plans for expansion of the existing bike parking within car parks in

the city centre; however, this can be further examined with the relevant stakeholders in due

course.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if Treaty City flags can be***

***placed along the bridges in celebration of the achievements of the club within Limerick.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council are currently working on a protocol for flags on the

Shannon and Thomond Bridges. Currently the Limerick GAA flags are in place until end of

the senior hurling championship. We are discussing the possibility of positioning two flags

on a pole at once, but we are awaiting a response on this from an outside company.

Going forward the cost of putting flags up and taking them down again, is something that

Limerick City and County Council will review and include in the aforementioned policy. As a

proud partner and supporter of Treaty United and indeed all sporting organisations in

Limerick, Limerick City and County Council are continuing to identify other poles, places etc.

where we can hang flags and banners to highlight sporting teams and their achievements.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick which CCTV cameras are***

***turned on and in the Canal Bank area from Lelia Street to UL/Shannon Fields.***

**REPLY**: The Canal and River Bank CCTV scheme operated by Limerick City and County Council

consists of eleven poles with two cameras on each giving a total of twenty-two cameras. At

present twenty cameras are recording back to our monitoring centre located at the Moyross

Community Enterprise Centre. These cameras are not live monitored they are recording

only. The one pole, which is currently not connected to the scheme, is expected to be online

in the coming weeks.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many tenant in situ***

***applications are currently open and how many have been processed since April 1st 2023.***

**REPLY**: The Housing Directorate are currently dealing with 231 open notice to quits.

At the 14th June, 2023 we have 43 homes at sale agreed, 54 sales are under negotiation, a

further 120 at proposal stage and 14 households have been referred for consideration

under the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the number of HAP and***

***RAS inspections carried out this year and the results of same.***

**20.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when will an economic***

***assessment be conducted for Wickham Street / High Street regarding the proposed Active Travel***

***Scheme.***

**REPLY**: An Economic Assessment is to be conducted over the coming months for Wickham Street /

High Street regarding the proposed Active Travel Scheme. The estimated date for delivery

of the Economic Assessment Report is November 2023. In recent weeks, Active Travel has

engaged specialists for counting movement and traffic in the area, along with a specialist to

undertake the Economic Assessment. Counting of movement and traffic will continue

through summer and autumn while retail and local surveys are planned for September.

Analysis is scheduled for October, and November will see the final drafting and completion

of the Economic Assessment Report.

Economic Assessment Schedule:

 September 2023: Phase 1 - Discovery Phase
---
9

 October 2023: Phase 2 - Analysis and Plan Development

 November 2023: Phase 3 - Economic Impact Plan

**21.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at**the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when Limerick City and***

***County Council expect all work on O'Connell Street to be completed and when we can expect the***

***3 person cleansing team to be appointed.***

**REPLY**: The works to O’Connell Street are largely complete with the exception of localised work

adjacent to some of the junctions. Arup Consulting Engineers (Arup) will determine the

contractual completion date following final inspection of the works. The resolution of any

snags identified by Arup will be addressed up to and after completion as is standard practice

in the industry.

Limerick City and County Council has approved the appointment of the 3-person team.

However, the Department of Local Government approval is required as this results in an

increase in overall staff numbers. Human Resources have sought this approval and have

identified the need for a quick decision by the Department. As soon as approval is received,

Human Resources will work with existing panels to appoint staff.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many vacancies exist***

***for School Wardens and when will they be filled if any exist.***

**REPLY:** One vacancy currently exists at John F Kennedy Memorial Primary School, this position has

been offered to a person who is currently going through the on boarding process with

Human Resources.

Outside the City centre area, one vacancy exists at St. Pauls School. In order to fill this post

and other future vacancies, Human Resources will shortly be advertising for panels to fill

permanent positions as they arise and for a panel to provide cover for posts where the

assigned School Warden is unavailable, for example when School Wardens are on sick leave.

Three School Wardens are currently unavailable for duty.

Recruitment for School Warden Panels, especially for cover positions, has proven to be

difficult.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond (referred from Meeting of Limerick City**

**and County Council held on 22nd** **May, 2023)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would, as a matter of***

***allowing access to the water for residents and visitors, including Dragon Boat personnel.***
---
10

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor Benson and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Pond referred to the excellent amenity provided by the

Pontoon in particular to the Members of the Dragon Boat Club and members agreed that this

pontoon was very important to this group and to others in the area.

**REPLY:** Following a site visit and meetings between the Directorates of Sport and Recreation,

Planning, Environment and Placemaking and Transportation and Mobility, it has been

agreed that the Council will liaise with the statutory bodies to determine the permissions

required to maintain the pontoon in place. In the meantime, the Council will maintain the

access to the pontoon and have recently carried out repairs to it.

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (to be referred to the Community, Leisure**

**and Culture Strategic Policy Committee)**

***a byelaw to address the growing problem of unused cars left in housing estates and driveways,***

***which are an eyesore for residents and a magnet for antisocial behaviour.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment

Strategic Policy Committee.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that in light of the many***

***active travel improvements taking place in this district that we draft and implement a public***

***engagement policy which sets out best practice for engagement with local stakeholders when***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that more physical***

***infrastructure for Community Space, as in Community Centres and spaces, are included in large-***

***scale projects in Limerick City and County.*** ***Economic growth has been introduced in Limerick but***
---
11

***we are lacking physical infrastructure for our communities and community groups.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Secas and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted the difficulties that community groups had

in finding suitable accommodation and the importance of providing facilities, in particular for

youths and the elderly.

**REPLY**: The Limerick Development Plan 2022 – 2028 seeks to improve the provision of community

infrastructure and recreational opportunities for the wider community, in co-operation with

relevant bodies. In assessing planning applications developments, there is a requirement to

ensure that adequate social infrastructure is in place to support such development,

however, there is no provision for developers to provide such infrastructure. An audit of

Community Facilities was undertaken by Limerick City and County Council in 2022 and the

findings of this audit will assist in a strategic approach for improved community physical

infrastructure projects and support potential funding applications in the future.

Councillor Leddin proposed that an audit be carried out, in conjunction with Property Services, on

sites and buildings in the Metropolitan Area zoned for community that could potentially be used

for community spaces. This was seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne. Members also agreed that

community facilities were important in areas of the Metropolitan District where the population was

expanding and the importance of identifying suitable funding sources to provide same. It was also

agreed to circulate the Community Facilities Audit Report 2022, referenced in the reply, to the

Members.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that now that the area***

***separating the two estates of Glenbrook and Glendale Old Singland Roads are taken in charge,***

***that the Council implement the planning condition requiring that bollards be installed at this***

***location, as per the original planning application approval.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Pond and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery referred to the increase in traffic that would occur with

the opening of the new Bloodmill road, and the difficulties this would cause for residents in the

housing estates.

**REPLY**: The request to separate the estates of Glenbrook and Glendale Old Singland Roads will be

reviewed by Limerick City and County Council Roads and Planning Departments. Any

conditions of this development that the Planning Department sets out will be determined

and reviewed. Any proposal to close this road, if deemed adequate by Limerick City and

County Council Roads and Planning Departments, would require a public advertisement

procedure to take place given the time that has lapsed since the original planning for this

development was granted over 20 years ago.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**
---
12

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council write to the Garda Chief Superintendent to outline Councillors concerns regarding***

***the use of scrambler bikes, associated anti-social/criminal behaviour and lawlessness on the***

***smarter travel paths from Lock Quay and Corbally to the University of Limerick and ask for regular***

***police presence on this path.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan highlighted the issues caused by the misuse of

scrambler bikes and the need for additional Garda patrols and it was agreed by Members that this

was a very serious issue given the potential dangers posed, and was not just confined to the areas

referred to in the Motion. Members agreed that stronger legislation needed to be introduced which

should deal with scrambler bike and e scooters as well.

Members also referred to other issues around anti-social behaviour in the Metropolitan District

and on the proposal of Councillor O’Sullivan, seconded by Cllr Butler, it was agreed to look at

establishing a Joint Policing Sub-Committee specifically for the Metropolitan District where such

issues could be discussed directly with representatives of An Garda Siochána with responsibility for

the Metropolitan District area.

**30.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council implement a daily and thorough schedule of cleaning and maintenance for the***

***City Centre particularly for O'Connell Street.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan referred to the recent Workshop that was held on

O’Connell Street and welcomed the confirmation that a regular schedule of cleaning would be

undertaken.

**REPLY**: A Cleansing Plan for O’Connell Street is being finalised and requires an additional three

members of staff to be recruited to the Cleansing Team. This plan will include daily bin

emptying and litter picking, power washing of footpath surfaces and stone street furniture,

monthly hot washing of footpaths, cycle lane sweeping, carriageway sweeping, monitoring

of litter levels and inspection of works. When this plan is well established, the intention is

to broaden the plan to the other streets in the city centre. It should be noted that O’Connell

Street is currently being cleaned in accordance with current cleansing operations.

**31.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that Limerick City and***

***County Council would urgently consider installing CCTV and any other appropriate measures on***

***The Castletroy Greenway to combat increasing incidents of antisocial behaviour both on the***

***Greenway and in adjoining estates.***
---
13

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor Secas and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Pond referred to the increasing incidents of anti-social

behaviour on the Castletroy Greenway and that consideration should be given to the installation of

CCTV cameras.

**REPLY**: In order to utilise CCTV in a public space, like The Castletroy Greenway, it is necessary to

have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis for public realm CCTV is based on Section 38 of

An Garda Síochána Act 2005 and requires authorisation from the Garda Commissioner. The

legislation provides a legal basis for Community CCTV schemes. The installation of

Community CCTV involves a very stringent process balancing the right to privacy with the

need for safer communities. Each location must have a legal basis and adhere to the

principles of data protection. The installation of a camera in a public space requires a

direction from An Garda Síochána.

For new Community CCTV schemes (or additions to existing schemes) to be considered:

 An Garda Síochána’s analyst team must prepare a crime report detailing the historical

levels of crime at each specific potential location of a camera (using GPS coordinates).

If crime levels are deemed sufficiently high, this becomes the starting point of the

official process.

 A report must be created outlining the case and rationale for CCTV, including all

potential locations of cameras (including GPS coordinates) and must be submitted to

the CCTV Oversight Board for review. The rationale for CCTV must be deemed to be

proportional, justified and necessary.

o The report must include details of all alternative measures taken to address the

situation including results achieved/not achieved

o The report must also include details of the funding sources for the cameras

(including ongoing operational costs)

 A Data Protection Impact Assessment must be prepared and submitted to the Data

Protection Officer for review.

 A Community CCTV application must be prepared by the Council for submission to the

Garda Commissioner for review. This application must include evidence of public

consultation, evidence of historical crime, evidence of approval by the JPC, among many

other necessary supporting pieces of documentation.

These are sequential steps that must be taken to ensure all CCTV schemes are necessary,

justified, proportionate and legal.

In view of the above, I will bring your concerns to the attention of the relevant department

with responsibility for The Castletroy Greenway and ask them to consider other appropriate

measures such as liaising directly with An Garda Siochana with the view to an increased

presence of Gardaí in the area.

**REPORT FROM FÁILTE IRELAND**

**Fáilte Ireland – Tourism Information Strategy Explanation**

To meet the evolving needs of our visitors and deliver relevant information in a manner that visitors

are seeking, Fáilte Ireland is modernising its In-Destination Tourism Information service.

Footfall to Fáilte Ireland’s TICs in Limerick declined by 60% between 2015 and 2019 while

international and domestic visitor numbers increased by 30% and 32% respectively during the same

period. The pace of this decline, which was accelerating, means that to continue to reach and

influence our visitors, we must evolve our programme of activities.

Our new programme, which is being replicated in many locations across the country, is designed to

reach far more visitors and to meet their needs on their terms. Fáilte Ireland will do this through

the following channels:

 **Seasonal co-located TIC**. Our new base in King Johns Castle will allow us engage with more

visitors and to influence them to visit Limerick City and County.

 **New Discover Ireland.ie.** The new mobile first Discover Ireland.ie website is loaded with

local and hyper-local Limerick information. The site is content managed by Fáilte Ireland’s

TIC staff.

 **New Information Kiosks.** Our highly attractive, promotional kiosks are located in King Johns

Castle (year round), The Hunt Museum, International Rugby Experience, Bunratty Visitor

Park, Shannon Airport, and Adare Heritage Centre.

 **New Map Guides.** Fáilte Ireland produces a Limerick Town and a Limerick Regional Map

Guide(s) in five languages.

map guides.

 **The Local Expert Programme:** Lastly, the Local Expert programme, which is designed to

empower frontline workers to solve the visitors ‘what to do’ problem in a timely and

comprehensive way, was launched in Limerick earlier this year**.**

 **Extended Contact Centre Service(s).**  Fáilte Ireland has extended its Contact Centre

operations to 365 days from 9am to 7pm. Supporting Call, Email and Chat.

In summary, the aggregate of all our activities will allow us reach many more visitors to the area

and to meet their needs on their terms.

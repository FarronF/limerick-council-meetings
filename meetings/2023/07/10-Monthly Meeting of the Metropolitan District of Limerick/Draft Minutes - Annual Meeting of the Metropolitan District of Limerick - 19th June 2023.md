Metropolitan District of Limerick and congratulated him on his election.

The Members congratulated Councillor Talukder on his election as Cathaoirleach and wished him

every success in the coming year. They agreed that his Election was historic, and, following on from

three years of a female Cathaoirleach in the Metropolitan District, that it demonstrated that

Limerick is a diverse city. They agreed that Cllr Talukder had made an excellent Deputy Mayor in

2020 and had no doubt that he would make an excellent Cathaoirleach too.

The newly elected Cathaoirleach, Councillor Talukder, said it was a huge privilege to have

represented the people of Limerick City West and the Metropolitan District for the past 4 years and

that he was greatly honoured to now be elected as Cathaoirleach of the Metropolitan District of

Limerick. He thanked his wife Shahana Akter, and his two daughters, Tashfia and Amirah for their

continued help and support that they had given him and the sacrifices that they had made over the

years to support him in his role as a Councillor. He outlined how he had come to Limerick to work

from Bangladesh in 2000 and how he had a built a life for himself and his family and how Limerick

had now become his home and he was proud to be called a Limerick man.

He remembered former Councillor Jerry O’Dea, who had passed unexpectedly in 2022 and who had

been such a good friend and mentor to him. He also thanked his Fianna Fáil colleagues for their

support and for nominating him to this position and those who had voted for him. He pledged to

work with all the Elected Members during his term on behalf of all the people in the Metropolitan

District. He thanked the Management and staff of Limerick City and County Council for their work

and efforts in providing a wide range of services across the Metropolitan District.

He outlined how Limerick was now a multi-cultural city and his election as Cathaoirleach, sent a

strong message to everyone that if you get involved in your local community or in politics, and work

for others in your community, that you can succeed. He confirmed that he would like to see an

Integration Officer installed on the staff of Limerick City and County Council to offer advice and

support to immigrants arriving in Limerick and to help them with the transition. Cllr Talukder

congratulated the Limerick Senior Hurling Team on their recent five-in-a-row Munster championship

success and he looked forward to the challenge of the All-Ireland Semi-Final against Galway and

hopefully further All Ireland success in 2023.

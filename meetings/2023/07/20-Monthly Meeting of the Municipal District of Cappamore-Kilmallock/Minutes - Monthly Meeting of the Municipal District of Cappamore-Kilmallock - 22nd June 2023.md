4. Update on Athenacey Burial Grounds

Further to the questions submitted to the Burial Grounds Officers at the May meeting of the

Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District, the following clarification was provided:

 The Burial grounds at Athenacey are vested in Limerick City and County Council

 Legal advice has been sought regarding legal right of way to the Burial grounds.

There is no legal right of way or burden and no right to park outside the burial

grounds.

 Engagement with the landowners and community is ongoing

 There has only ever been pedestrian access to the burial grounds.

 The sightlines from the burial grounds are inadequate to formally provide parking at

the burial grounds.

 On the Elton side of the Burial ground, a nearby layby would require a 200m

footpath to allow safe access to the entrance to the burial ground and based on the

medieval nature of the grounds, archeological investigations would need to be

undertaken.

A discussion took place regarding the next possible steps to be taken.

A suggestion was made that a change to the speed limit may allow the sightlines required to

be reduced. It was clarified that all safety guidelines will need to be considered and a

request for a speed limit review will need to be submitted.

An Cathaoirleach acknowledged the impact that this negotiation is having on all parties and

that all parties are willing to work towards a solution. He also suggested that a mediator be

appointed to support the negotiations between Limerick City and County Council, the

landowners and community. This suggestion was supported by all Elected members.

Finally An Cathoirleach, on behalf of the Elected Members made clear that antisocial

A time frame as follows was agreed – an update would be provided where appropriate at

QUESTIONS

7.  Question submitted by Councillor Carey

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the Stone Mansion House, Kilmallock, when the Part8 procedure would commence and

an update on the application under the Fáilte lreland Large Capital Grant Scheme.---
**REPLY:**

The arrangement remains that Limerick City & County Council will work in partnership with

the National Monuments Service, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage

and the Office of Public Works, Department of Finance who maintain and manage the State’s

buildings on behalf of the Minister of Heritage on this project to develop a joint application

for funding. There has been significant changes of management within both of the strategic

partners and a considerable amount of reorganisation within the LA itself. It will be necessary

to reconnect at a management level to consolidate and finalise the draft vision statement.

Also the issue of the lease is taking longer to work its way through the system than originally

envisaged. It is still proposed to offer the LA the Victorian Building and the rear courtyard on

a long term lease.

8. Question submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the Market House, Kilfinane. If LCCC have ownership and what repair works or plans lay

in store for the building.”

**REPLY:**

The Market House, Kilfinane, is in Council ownership. In recent weeks the Property

management section has arranged for extensive treatment works to be undertaken on the

ivy overgrowth on the building in accordance with a treatment plan provided by the

Conservation officer, Mr Tom Cassidy. In addition, rubbish removal has been arranged

internally and the entrance to the building has been re-secured.

The Property management section now intent to procure a Conservation Structural Engineer

to assess the buildings structure, and a plan will be drafted which will include actions to

prevent further deterioration of the stonework and integrity of the building.

9. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District are there any

plans for a Columbarium Wall or Ash Plots in the Municipal District.”

**REPLY:**

The Council has no plans to install Columbarian walls within cemetaries in the Municipal

District. However, the Council are developing cremation plots in the new cemetaries that

are currently being developed. There are thirty four cremation plots being provided as part

of the newly developed burial ground extension in Ballylanders, each capable of---
accommodating multiple cremated remains and where feasible, within existing burial

grounds in order to facilitate the growing demand for the internment of ashes.

The consideration and incorporation of cremated plots is being considered in accordance

with the Burial Grounds Strategy, where 7% of all burials in the Cappamore Kilmallock

district were cremations.

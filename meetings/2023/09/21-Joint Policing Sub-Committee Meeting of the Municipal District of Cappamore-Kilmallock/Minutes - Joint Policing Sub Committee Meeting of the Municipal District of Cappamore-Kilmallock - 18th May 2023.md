In relation to burglaries, there were arrests in Baggotstown, Bruff and Kilfinane.

There was a seizure of cocaine and cash in Bruree. There has been an increase in drug driving

nationally and locally. Arrests were also made in relation to thefts from churches in Athlacca

and Bruree, and in Bruff in relation to thefts from vehicles.

On 22nd-26th May there will be Information days rolled out across the county including in

Kilmallock, Bruff and Pallasgreen. Details will be circulated.

A discussion took place regarding the increase in drug use, detection and the drug unit.

The issue of anti social behaviour at the railway bridge at the Kilmallock roundabout was also

highlighted, and the Director of Services advised the Elected Members that Iarnrod Eireann

were aware of the issue and looking at security measures.

A recent meeting with An Garda Siochana regarding a stolen wheelchair was welcomed.

Speeding and parking on footpaths.

The issues of speeding (highlighted through an increase in reports to the local authority in

specific towns and villages in the district) and parking on footpaths (raised through discussions

with the Step Forward Group, Hospital) were discussed.

An Garda Siochana have agreed to pay more attention to the areas highlighted as having issues

with speeding by engaging the traffic corps to undertake random checkpoints with their speed

detection devices. It was also noted that batteries had been stolen from driver feedback signs.

The Acting Senior Executive Engineer advised those present that the driver feedback signs can

be used for traffic surveys and the results of these surveys can be shared with An Gardai

regarding speed of vehicles where it is reported as an issue.

A request was raised by the Elected Members that the speed limit in rural towns and villages

be reviewed and reduced to 30kmph. The Elected members were advised that speed limits

must comply with national legislation but that they can be appealed.

Further to the meeting with the Step Forward group it was noted that in areas where there is

sufficient parking, and sufficient space on the road not to park on the footpath, vehicles are

still parking on footpaths and obstructing pedestrians, in particular those with physical

impairments or disabilities. It was highlighted by the Elected Members that larger vehicles are

also parking on footpaths and impairing the integrity of the footpath, causing damage in the

long run.

It was noted that the Step Forward group had also made a presentation to the Travel and

Transport SPC and that an update on an awareness campaign would follow.

The Director of Services will set up a meeting with the Roads Policing Superintendent and Chief

Superintendent regarding the issues highlighted above and provide an update on same to the

Travel and Transport SPC in June and back to the Cappamore Kilmallock Joint Policing

Committee.---

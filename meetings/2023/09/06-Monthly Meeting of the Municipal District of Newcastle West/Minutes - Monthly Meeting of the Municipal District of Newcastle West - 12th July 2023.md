situation with regard to street lights not operational in the Newcastle West Municipal District.

He stated that the number of street lights not working represents 1% of the total number of

street lights in the District. He acknowledged that there is currently a delay in getting some

lights fixed due to a requirement to having a public lighting micro-pillar installed before the

lighting maintenance contractor can carry out a repair. He stated that this requires the ESB

to be in attendance but however is working with the ESB in dealing with all the street lights

that need to have micro-pillars installed. He stated that as a result it appears that the ESB are

currently finding it difficult to resource the number of cases currently being escalated by

REPLY:

A topographical survey was carried out for Lee’s Cross in Q4 of 2021 as part of a joint

examination of Lee’s Cross and Chawke’s Cross. This survey was used to facilitate an outline

preliminary scheme plan for both junctions and from this plan a design report was prepared

and submitted to the Department for funding in Q3 of 2022.

Based on this design report Lee’s Cross was successful in its application for Specific

Improvement Grant funding and an allocation of €25,000 was provided in 2023.

Limerick City and County Council have since procured a consultant to develop the outline

design and bring to Part VIII in Q3 of this year. This work is currently progressing with the

ecological and environmental surveys complete and the civil design ongoing.

Limerick City and County Council have made initial contact with landowners and plan to

engage with them with outline plans in July prior to the submission of the Part VIII planning

application.

Should the Part VII application be successful Limerick City and County Council will approach

the Department for additional funding to bring this scheme to construction stage. Should

funding be provided Limerick City and County Council will look to purchase the necessary

land and appoint a consultant to prepare and deliver a detailed design of the scheme and the

associated contract documents.

The estimated cost of the works will be dependent on a number of factors including the

finalised detail design, the procurement of land and economic environment at the time of

tender. However it is estimated that the total scheme cost will be in the order of €1 million

to €1.5 million.---
10

To date the following is a breakdown of costs associated with this junction:

 Topographical Survey - €4,500 Ex VAT

 Consultants appointed to develop preliminary design - €4,550 Ex VAT

 Consultants appointed to bring to the Part VIII process - €19,980 Ex VAT (Expected

Spend 2023).

NOTICES OF MOTION

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Focus Ireland provide this Municipality with an***

***up-to-date status report on the 5 properties sold to it under Housing Directorates***

***Recommendations of February 21**st*** ***2022.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY:

Focus Housing Association received funding approval from the Housing Finance Agency on

the 19th June 2023 to refurbish 3 properties in Castleview Estate, Radharc Na Féile and

Feenagh as part of the stock transfer in the Newcastle West District. The legal transfers are

underway at present, and it’s expected that contracts will be exchanged in July 2023.

Following an update from Focus Housing Association on the 4th July 2023, it is anticipated that

the Contractor employed on behalf of Focus Housing Association can mobilise to commence

works on the three properties three weeks from when contracts are signed. The estimated

date of completion for these 3 properties is Q4 2023.

LA Housing and Construction will refurbish 4 Lower Maiden Street, Newcastle West in

addition to the adjacent Local Authority dwelling at number 5 Lower Maiden Street,

Newcastle West (SHIP Renew). The design and tender process is ongoing for both units,

contractor appointment in September 2023 and works period 6 months.

The unit at North Road Dromcollogher which is being assigned to Focus Housing Association

is beside a Local Authority Buy and Renew property. For efficiency, both properties will be

refurbished together with one builder. LA Housing Construction and Maintenance have

concluded the procurement process and a builder has been identified to carry out works to

both properties. The estimated completion date is Q4 2023. The Housing Directorate are

counting both units for delivery in 2023 and have notified the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage of same.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the unsightly condition of the

properties referred to above and to the delay in refurbishment of these properties. In

replying, the Senior Executive Officer stated that legal transfers are underway at present and

that Focus Housing Association has sought funding approval. She also stated that the---
11

Contractor employed on behalf of the Focus Housing Association is ready to commence works

on the three properties shortly after the legal documents are in place. The Director, Housing,

also reiterated that Focus Housing Association is a registered charitable organisation.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that full responsibility for Housing within our Municipality***

***be managed here in Newcastle West.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

All functions carried out by a Local Authority are designated either reserved or executive

functions.

Reserved functions are functions carried out by the Plenary (Full) Council or individual districts

and are set out in legislation. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 and associated

regulations set out a comprehensive listing of reserved functions to be performed exclusively

by Municipal District Members or by Municipal District Members or the Plenary Council or by

the Plenary Council only. The Motion seeks to contravene the legislation by seeking to have

“full responsibility for housing” to be managed in the Newcastle West District and as such

should be deemed invalid.

Executive functions are all functions that are not reserved functions are carried out by the

Chief Executive. The Chief Executive can delegate a function to other officials while at the

same time retaining overall responsibility for it. Housing executive functions include but not

limited to the following:

 Housing Assessment

 Housing Allocation

 The Differential Rent Scheme and Debt Management

 Acquisition of land

 Purchase of houses

 Housing Construction

 Private Housing Grants

 Housing Loans

 Tenant Purchase Scheme

 Tenancy Sustainment

 Affordable Housing

 Traveller Accommodation

 HAP/RAS

 Homeless Services

 Housing Maintenance

 Energy Retrofit Programmes

 Defective House Grant Scheme---
12

The Government has assigned a central role to Local Authorities for the delivery of Housing

for All. There is a considerable range of options under this programme, some of which are

quite complex and this can be most effectively delivered at a central level in the Council.

The proposal to devolve full responsibility for housing services to the Municipal District level

would be extremely complex and require significant additional resources, given the wide

range and variety of services in housing.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that full responsibility for Housing be

managed in the Newcastle West District. The Members referred to a number of matters

including the availability of the Housing Engineer to attend the Municipal District Meetings,

block grants to deliver housing, GDPR Regulations and vacant houses in the District.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will move at the next Meeting that the light at the entrance to Daar Lane, Gortboy,***

***Newcastle West will be fixed as soon as possible. This light has not worked in months and***

***the residents in the area are very angry. I am looking for a commitment that this will be***

***fixed within the next three weeks. There is a service level agreement in place which is not***

***being upheld and we must demand a better service.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

Light 36 Cluain Arra, Gortboy, Newcastle West, was identified by the PL maintenance

contractor as having an underground cable fault December 2022. Works have been carried

out to rectify this fault, however the light is directly fed by an ESB source and an interface

needs to be installed before the light can become operational again.

We acknowledge that currently there is a delay in getting some lights fixed. This is primarily

due to a requirement to have the ESB present to facilitate the installation of interfaces and to

deal with faults on the ESB network. The requirements for ESB presence on site is necessary

to comply with safety standards from Safe Electric that must be adhered to.

It does however appear that the ESB are currently finding it difficult to resource the number

of cases that are currently being escalated by Limerick City and County Council. We are

endeavouring to work with the ESB engineers on the ground who have committed to facilitate

us in so far as they can. We are continuing to proactively manage these issues and are working

closely with our maintenance contractor (Enerveo) and the ESB to get these items closed out

in a timely manner. At present resources allowing from the ESB we hope to have this issue

resolved as soon as possible.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle requested that the light at the entrance to Daar

Lane, Gortboy, be fixed and in replying, the Executive Engineer stated that a micro pillar is to

be put in place at this location and the light is to be connected by the E.S.B. shortly.---

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that***  ***Limerick City and County Council carry out***

These works will not clash with the Listowel races in September.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that works be carried out to the road

Administrator stated that this matter has been referred to the relevant Directorate.

Reference was made to safety measures at the Glebe in Monagea and in replying, the Senior

Executive Engineer stated that traffic calming measures will be installed at this location,

ideally before the schools open in September 2023.

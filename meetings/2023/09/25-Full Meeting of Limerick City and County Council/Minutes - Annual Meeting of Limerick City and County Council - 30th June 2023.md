Councillor O’Hanlon, for his experience and invaluable support with what was a very busy

schedule of events during the year.

1.

Election of Mayor of the City and County of Limerick

The outgoing Mayor invited nominations for the Office of Mayor of the City and County of

Limerick for the coming year.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Egan (J);

“That, Councillor Gerald Mitchell be appointed Mayor of the City and County of

Limerick to hold office to the next Annual Meeting or until his successor is appointed.”

As there were no other nominations, the outgoing Mayor declared Councillor Mitchell elected

as Mayor of the City and County of Limerick and offered him his congratulations and best

wishes for the coming year.

Having taken the Chair, the incoming Mayor, Councillor Mitchell, gave the following address:

Colleagues, Chief Executive and officials of Limerick City and County Council, family and

friends. It is such a huge honour for me to be elected as the first citizen of Limerick today. It

is a position that all local politicians strives for, but not all are elected, so I am so proud to

now being among that number. There is a long and valued history of Mayors of Limerick and

I intend to uphold that honoured tradition and do my best for the people of Limerick. I would

like to congratulate Cllr Foley and Cllr O’Hanlon on their very successful term as Mayor and

Deputy Mayor respectively.

Being Mayor is a responsibility that I will take very seriously, with the humility that the office

deserves. I am custodian of these chains for the next 12 months and I will do my best for all

communities right across our great city and county. We all stand for election and become

involved in politics for the right reasons, representing our communities and peers and seeking

to make our collective lives better and more progressive.

I wish to thank my proposer Cllr John Sheahan and seconder Cllr John Egan for proposing me

for the position of Mayor of the City and County of Limerick and I want to thank all those who

have supported me in the election today.---

I intend to make investment in rural communities a priority during my term, as more needs

to be done to make the countryside more attractive for investment and residential

development. In particular, I want to see pressure put on Uisce Eireann to improve water

and sewage facilities in our county towns and villages, many of which are not fit for purpose.

This lack of important development is stifling growth and investment and must be

addressed as soon as possible, if we are to stem the flow of young people from the

countryside. People need options for employment and housing in their local areas.

In Limerick, we are enjoying strong economic growth, and I hope to see strong levels of

investment continuing in our city. Limerick needs a strong city at its core and the benefits

will reverberate out across the county as a rising tide lifts all boats. Limerick is a place that

people from many different countries and backgrounds call home. I will represent all

communities in Limerick during my term and ensure that every section of these

communities receives the due recognition they deserve.

I am proud to be continuing a family legacy of public representation as the fifth Mitchell

involved in Limerick local politics following Thomas B. Mitchell who was the first Chairman

of Limerick County Council in 1899. I also think of my parents Eileen and Edmond J. Mitchell

who always used to help people in the locality and being good neighbours came naturally to

them both. There were many sacrifices made by previous generations and now it was up to

the current generation to build on the progress made to date.

Finally, I wish to acknowledge John Kiely, the Limerick Senior Hurling Team, and the success

that they have brought to Limerick over the past few years, and I wish them well in their

forthcoming All Ireland Senior Hurling Semi-Final against Galway.

Luimneach Abú-Go raibh míle maith agaibh.

2.

Election of Deputy Mayor of the City and County of Limerick

The Mayor invited nominations for the Office of Deputy Mayor of the City and County of

Limerick for the coming year.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Butler;

“That, Councillor Dan McSweeney be appointed Deputy Mayor of the City and County

of Limerick to hold office to the next Annual Meeting or until his successor is

appointed.”

As there were no other nominations the Mayor declared Councillor McSweeney elected as

Deputy Mayor of the City and County of Limerick and congratulated him on his election.---

The incoming Deputy Mayor, Councillor McSweeney, then addressed the Meeting:

I am delighted to be elected today to the post of Deputy Mayor and thanks to my Fine Gael

colleagues for nominating me, and all my colleagues who supported me here today. I am

honoured to take up the position of Deputy Mayor of our fine city and county. I will

endeavour to work hand-in-hand with Mayor Mitchell in supporting him in carrying out his

duties as Mayor and I know we will work very well together. This is also a huge honour for my

family, friends and wider community as well.

I was elected in 2019 to the Limerick City West Electoral Area in the Metropolitan District of

Limerick at the age of 20, but I learned the ropes of how to operate as a Councillor very

quickly. I have worked hard to represent the people of Limerick City West and the wider

Metropolitan District to the best of my ability. I acknowledge the important work being

done across many areas of our city and county by the management and staff of Limerick City

and County Council, in conjunction with the Elected Members. My key focus will be to

continue to enhance the provision of Community, Sport and Recreation facilities, the

delivery of Affordable and Social Homes, tackling dereliction in our communities and

improving connectivity with Limerick City Centre.

The Members welcomed the guests who were present. They congratulated the Mayor and

Deputy Mayor on their election and assured them of their full support. They wished them well

in the year ahead and expressed confidence in their ability to carry out the duties of Mayor

and Deputy Mayor with great honour and distinction.

Tributes were also paid to the outgoing Mayor, Councillor Foley, and the outgoing Deputy

Mayor, Councillor O’Hanlon. Members commended them for the manner in which they had

performed their roles during the year.

The Chief Executive congratulated Councillor Mitchell and Councillor McSweeney on their

election to the Office of Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the City and County of Limerick

respectively. He stated that it was an honour to hold the Office of Mayor, a responsible

position that carried with it the challenge of delivering leadership for and on behalf of the

people of Limerick. He looked forward to working with them over the next twelve months to

promote Limerick. He also acknowledged the accomplishments of the outgoing Mayor and

Deputy Mayor and their work over the past year.

This concluded the Meeting.

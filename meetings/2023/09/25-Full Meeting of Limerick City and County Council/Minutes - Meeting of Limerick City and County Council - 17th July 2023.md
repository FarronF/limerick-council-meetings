Update on Community CCTV in Limerick

The Head of Digital Services, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, gave an

update to the Council on Community CCTV in Limerick following a Data Protection

Commission Audit.

He outlined the following to the Members:

 We have 353 Community CCTV Cameras across 4 schemes – (Northside 121, Southside

122, Canal & Riverbank 22, Hinterland 88)

 Traffic cameras remain off as per outcome of DPC inquiry

 Waste management cameras are not available yet but noted waiting for new

legislation to be signed to permit use of cameras.
---
10

 He reminded Members that funding and governance of CCTV cameras is very

important as CCTV processes personal data.

 He outlined to the Members the remediation actions that had to be completed as per

final report received from the DPC inquiry, and confirmed that all were completed on

time.

 Highlighted the process for applying for new Community CCTV schemes and how it

was a long process. He noted that the process must include evidence of public

consultation, evidence of historical crime, evidence of approval by the JPC amongst

other documentation, and acknowledged that CCTV is an option of last resort.

The Members thanked the Head of Digital Services for his presentation and welcomed the

update. They acknowledged the work that has gone into this and commended the council for

the swift and professional response. They stressed their concerns over the long process to

apply for a new Community CCTV scheme, noting that new areas such as greenways will not

have evidence of historical crime. Members requested if details of how to apply could be

shared with them. Members queried how the cameras will be maintained and if there is a

contract in place.

Members also expressed disappointment that smart features had to be turned off including

automatic number plate recognition as they considered this would be of great help in catching

those responsible for carrying out crimes. Members agreed that when new legislation comes

in allowing waste management cameras be used, it will help significantly to prevent illegal

dumping.

Head of Digital Strategy responding to their queries highlighting they did have a maintenance

contract in place and that we are obliged to ensure the cameras are working. He agreed to

circulate the application process on how to apply for new CCTV Scheme.

**Suspension of Standing Orders:** It was noted that the time was approaching 5.30 p.m., and

on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Ryan (E), Standing Orders

were suspended in order to complete the agenda.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Forward Planning Section commence a review of**

**the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 with a view to amending the terms of Objective**

**SS 017** **–** **Rural Areas under Strong Urban Influence to allow residents of Tier 4 Settlements**

**build in the rural countryside without the current constraints.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Keary and seconded by Councillor Collins (B).

**REPLY:**

**Background:** The Limerick Development Plan was adopted after an extensive

period of consultation, which included discussions on the draft rural housing

policy over a number of workshops with the Elected Members. Following these

workshops, the Draft Limerick Development Plan was adopted at a Special

Council Meeting on 14.6.2021 at which stage the Members made additional

changes to the rural policy to allow for people who live in a level 4 settlement,

where there is no capacity in the treatment plant, to be considered for a

dwelling in the rural area. The OPR in its submission to the Draft Plan

acknowledged that Limerick has a strong rural-based population but stated

that it also needs to support the National Strategic Outcomes (NSO) of

compact growth, sustainable mobility, transition to a low carbon and climate

resilient society and sustainable management of environmental resources.

**Reason for Objective:** The reason settlements identified in level’s 1-4

settlements are excluded from the definition of ‘Local rural Area’ is to ensure

compliance with National and Regional Policy, which requires growth in areas

under strong urban influence to be managed to avoid over development.

Relevant National and Regional Policies are as follows:
---
16

National Policy Objective 19, states “*allows* *the**provision of single housing in*

*the countryside based on**the core consideration of demonstrable**economic*

*or**social need**to live in a rural area and siting and design**criteria for rural*

*housing in statutory guidelines and plans,having regard to the viability of***

***smaller towns and rural**settlements*”**, in rural areas under urban influence.

Regional Policy Objective 27, also requires Local Authorities to include policies

for the protection of the viability of smaller towns and rural settlements as key

priority within Development plans and have regard to the viability of smaller

towns and rural settlements in relation to rural policies.

**Alternative provided in the Plan:** To help strengthen and consolidate the

settlement structure and reverse the decline in Limerick’s towns and villages,

the plan promotes residential serviced sites in settlements. This objective is

reinforced in the Government’s Rural Development Policy 2021 – 2025 – Our

Rural Future, which sets out a clear ambition to support the regeneration, re-

population and development of rural towns and villages, to contribute to local

and national economic recovery. It offers a real alternative to the single one-

off rural house, enabling those who seek the opportunity to build their own

homes to one’s own design, but located in a town or village.

**Conclusion: Having regard to the above, amending the objective as suggested**

**would be contrary to both the National Planning Framework and the Regional**

**Spatial and Economic Strategy. Therefore, I would not recommend**

**proceeding with this variation as proposed. It would also be contrary to a**

**number of policies and objectives in the Limerick Development Plan (listed**

**below) resulting in the plan being internally inconsistent.**

Policy CS P1 Core Strategy Implementation: It is a policy of the Council to

implement the Core Strategy for Limerick to ensure consistency with policies

at a national and regional level, in particular population targets and

distribution.

Policy CS P2 Compact Growth: It is a policy of the Council to support the

compact growth of Limerick City Metropolitan Area, towns and villages by

prioritising housing and employment development in locations within and

contiguous to existing City and town footprints where it can be served by

public transport and walking and cycling networks, to ensure that

development proceeds sustainably and at an appropriate scale, density and

sequence, in line with the Core Strategy Table 2.7.

Policy CGR P1 Compact Growth and Revitalisation: It is a policy of the Council

to achieve sustainable intensification and consolidation, in accordance with

the Core Strategy, through an emphasis on revitalisation and the delivery of

more compact and consolidated growth, integrating land use and transport,

with the use of higher densities and mixed use developments at an appropriate
---
17

scale on brownfield, infill, backland, state lands and underutilised sites within

the existing built footprint of Limerick’s City, Towns and Villages.

Objective CGR O3 Urban Lands and Compact Growth: It is an objective of the

Council to: a) Deliver 50% of new homes within the existing built-up footprint

of Limerick City and Suburbs (in Limerick), Mungret and Annacotty and 30% of

new homes within the existing built-up footprint of settlements, in a compact

and sustainable manner in accordance with the Core and Housing Strategies of

this Plan.

Director, Planning, Environment and Place-Making outlined what was required to

change the development plan and referred to and read the following section from the

Planning and Development ACT 2000 (as amended)

Section 13 - Variation of development plan.

13.—(1) A planning authority may at any time, for stated reasons, decide to

make a variation of a development plan which for the time being is in force.

F121[(1A) (a) The members of a planning authority may at any time, for

stated reasons, submit a resolution to the manager of the planning authority

requesting him or her to prepare a report on a proposal by them to initiate a

process to consider the variation of the development plan which for the time

being is in force where three quarters of the members of that authority have

approved such a resolution.

(b) The manager of a planning authority shall submit a report further to a

request under paragraph (a) to the elected members within four weeks of the

adoption of the resolution.]

Following further discussions, it was agreed to hold a workshop in relation to Tier 4

settlements with regard to issue of services and provision of affordable housing in the

County. It was further agreed, that a working group would be set up to examine areas

under pressure.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin **(to be referred to the**

**Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council establish a Working**

**Group across Roads, Planning and Active Travel to determine how best we can facilitate**

**those residents looking to bring their cars off the road but who reside on existing or planned**

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Service Level Agreements with the various providers**

**of Public Lighting be reviewed as a matter of urgency.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Scanlan and seconded by Councillor Benson.

REPLY:

As of July 2023, Limerick City and County Council manages and maintains

23,525 lights and their associated infrastructure within Limerick city and

county. On 7th July this year, there were 225 noted faults within this network,

which in turn corresponds to 1% of the overall network.

Of that 1% or 225 faults, 102 faults require the attendance of the ESB in order

to facilitate the installation of interfaces and to deal with faults on the ESB

network. The requirements for ESB presence on site is necessary to comply

with safety standards from Safe Electric that must be adhered to.

We have escalated a number of cases to the ESB and we are working closely

with their Engineers on the ground, who have committed to facilitating us

insofar as they can. We are continuing to proactively manage these issues and

are working closely with our maintenance contractor (Enerveo) and the ESB to

get these items closed out in a timely manner. It should be noted that ESB is

not a contractor/supplier to Limerick City and County Council. They are the

owners of the infrastructure that needs the separation interface outlined

above.

The remainder of the faults (123 or 0.5% of the Public Lighting stock) continue

to be proactively managed and repaired. As with all maintenance contracts,

there are, and will continue to be, challenges encountered which will be

managed in conjunction with our maintenance provider. In the last number of

years, we have switched to actively installing full LED heads as opposed to

replacing existing outdated technology (Sons and Sox fittings). This impacts

the time required to service lights but will improve energy usage and avoid

paying for duplicate retrofits at the same location when considering the

upcoming Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project (PLEEP) contract. It should

also be noted that there has been a vast improvement in outstanding faults
---
19

since the start of the year, with a reduction from approx. 274 to 123 (excluding

ESB interface faults).

Enerveo has actively sought to improve their service and provide additional

resources and recently have increased the number of crews to service

Limerick.

Notwithstanding the significant constraints outlined above, Limerick City and

County Council continues to work closely with Enerveo and other stakeholders

to provide a high level of service.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council apply a condition to all tenders going**

**forward, whereby employers must be fully compliant with all national pay agreements.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson and seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan.

REPLY:

All tenderers would be required to be fully compliant with all Statutory

Requirements/Agreements and this would form part of the Terms and

Conditions of the contract.

Prior to works contract award, the Council confirms of compliance of Sectoral

Employment Order 2021 (including the pension/sick pay scheme/rate of

pay/etc.) of the tenderer under consideration. This is sent to the Workplace

Partnership Facilitator by the person responsible for the contract, and

circulated to the Trade Unions.

Also, contractors are required to complete the Rates of Pay and Conditions of

Employment Certificate for each payment being processed by the Council.

Following discussions, Members requested that a private workshop be organised in

relation to procurement requirements with regard to tendering process and

compliance with national pay agreements. It was agreed that a workshop would be

arranged for Members.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**22A**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors J. Egan and D. McSweeney**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on Transport**

**Adare motorway/dual carriageway. The current agreement has expired and the lack of an**

**ongoing agreement will likely impact timely delivery of new infrastructure.**

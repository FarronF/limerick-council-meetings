Policing Committee held on 2” June, 2023) _

| will move at the next meeting for the creation of an action plan, similar to Operation Copég, to
target the ongoing drug dealing and associated crime in the Weston and Prospect areas of
Limerick City.

| will move at the next meeting for the provision of additional Garda resources in the city centre.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Hartigan

| will move at the next meeting of the JPC that the Chief Superintendent instigate a policy for a
prioritised and rapid response to reports of attacks on people by dogs in public places.

We move at the next meeting of the Joint Policing Committee that an emergency response road
traffic action plan be developed for all motorways and national roads in the Limerick area, in the
event of unplanned road closure. This plan should be a traffic emergency response plan for all
emergency services and be directed by An Garda Siochana under consultation with Limerick City
and County Council. This plan should allow the diversion of vehicles onto suitable roads and
avoid undue traffic pressure on unsuitable, narrow local roads which are unable to
accommodate high traffic volumes.

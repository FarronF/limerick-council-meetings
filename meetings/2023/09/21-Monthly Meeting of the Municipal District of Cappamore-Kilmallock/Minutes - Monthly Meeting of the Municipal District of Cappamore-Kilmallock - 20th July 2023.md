Local Authority Climate Action Plan

Director, Roads Transportation and Mobility, Brian Kennedy in the absence of Kieran Reeves,

Senior Executive Planner, Environment & Climate Change, who could not attend the meeting,

proceeded to present the proposed Draft Local Authority Climate Action Plan. This specifies

the mitigation measures and the adaptation measures to be adopted by the Local Authority.

He explained the focus of the Plan is on how the Council can reduce its emissions by 51% by

2030 and how it can also support other sectors reach their targets. He advised Members that

Kieran Reeves would return to the Cappamore-Kilmallock District in September to address

any queries or concerns they might wish to discuss at that stage.

A discussion ensued and Members requested an update on electric vehicle charging points in

the District and lack of same. Members were advised that Contractors have been appointed

and are working on installing civil works to facilitate the new pilot charging points at the

present time.

Councillor Martin Ryan was of the opinion that the changes required to reduce carbon

emissions needs to be done in a gradual cost-effective manner.

Councillor Eddie Ryan asked where the data for the document presented on climate change

was compiled saying there is a lot of misinformation everywhere on the subject and accurate

truthful information is needed

6. Deputation from Cuan Mhuire

The Members welcomed Paul O’Donoghue, Cuan Mhuire representative to the meeting who

proceeded to outline the work carried out by Cuan Mhuire in Bruree and at their other

Centres around the Country.

Mr. O’Donoghue outlined the issues facing the Cuan Mhuire service, saying there is huge

demand for the service. Cuan Mhuire needs to grow the service at the current time with

government intervention required, as current supports of ten euro per bed per night is not

sufficient to run the service and needs to be in the region of fifty euro per bed per night.

Following discussion all elected Members commended the work being done by Cuan Mhuire

and Councillor Martin Ryan proposed a motion be forwarded from the Cappamore-

Kilmallock Municipal District for inclusion on the Agenda for the next full Council meeting as

follows:---
“I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council make representations

to the Minister of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for

Finance to provide more financial support for the great work being done by the Cuan

Mhuire Association in Bruree and also throughout the Country and increase their

government allocation from ten euro per bed per night to fifty euro per bed per night”.

This motion was seconded by Councillor Eddie Ryan and agreed.

The Cathaoirleach thanked Mr. O’Donoghue for his informative presentation and

attendance at the meeting and acknowledged the great work being done by Cuan Mhuire

and asked he pass on the good wishes of the District to Sister Agnes and all the staff of the

Centres.

QUESTIONS

7.Question submitted by Councillor Carey

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District

**[a]** What is the criteria for a housing transfer request for a tenant of LCCC to apply for a

transfer to an alternative LCCC house

**[b]** What is the process of evaluating these same requests.

**[c]** How can a fair decision be made for same when some would-be applicants have been

refused a housing transfer application form and thus denied request for formal

application.

**REPLY:**

**[a]** As outlined in Limerick City and County Council’s Allocation Scheme 2021, Tenants of

the Housing Authority, including tenants of dwellings provided under the Social Housing

Leasing Initiative, RAS or by AHB’s may apply for consideration for a transfer to other

dwellings, under the following circumstances –

(a) overcrowding;

(b) where older persons and other households wish to move to smaller accommodation

(downsizing);

(c) medical/compassionate reasons;---
(d) on grounds of anti-social behaviour where the Housing Authority’s Estate

Management Unit and a Superintendent of An Garda Siochana support the transfer

application;

(e) other exceptional circumstances;

(f) to facilitate incremental purchase, where the authority has consented to such a

purchase.

**[b]** The process of evaluating these same requests is as follows:

Observations are sought from the Rents Department, Community Sustainment

Department, the Allocations Department and where relevant the Regeneration

Department or for tenants of AHB’s, from the relevant AHB in relation to the tenancy,

the rent account and any other issues including issues relating to Anti-Social Behaviour.

The application is assessed taking into account the household composition and the

reason for the application together with any supporting documentation submitted and a

house visit may take place. A recommendation is then made to either approve or refuse

the application.

**[c]** Tenants requesting a transfer form are contacted by a member of the Assessments

team to discuss the reason for the application in order to ascertain if they are eligible to

apply for a transfer and if there is a chance they may not be approved. This is to prevent

any undue hardship to the tenant as there is a non-refundable fee of €50.00 payable for

all transfer applications submitted to the Council, save in the following cases:

(a) Applicants applying to facilitate downsizing

(b) Applicants in receipt of RAS or HAP

(c) Transfers within regeneration areas.

Following the discussion, if a tenant requests a form to be issued, a form is issued and a

note recorded of the discussion.---

NOTICES OF MOTION

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District calling on

Limerick City and County Council to complete the procedure to allow for speed ramps,

traffic calming measures and a Set Down area for buses to be installed in the village of Elton

to address the safety concerns of the community.

**REPLY:**

The Cappamore-Kilmallock MD will assess existing traffic speeds in Elton to determine if

traffic is not adhering to the existing speed limit that is in place through the village.

If speeding is determined to be an issue, the Cappamore-Kilmallock MD will assess the most

appropriate traffic calming measures that would be appropriate.

The Cappamore-Kilmallock MD will also liaise with the Limerick Active Travel Office to

examine the feasibility of installing a set down area for buses.

It should be noted that any physical measures that may be identified regarding traffic

speeds and the request for a bus set down area will need to be submitted to the relevant

funding authority for their consideration as budgets would need to be secured to allow any

identified works to progress. In addition, it should also be noted that the implementation of

traffic measures requires a public consultation process to be followed.

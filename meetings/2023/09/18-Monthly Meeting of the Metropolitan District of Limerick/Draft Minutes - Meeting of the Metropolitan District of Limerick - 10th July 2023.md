**QUESTIONS**

**4.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a written update on***

***progress on ongoing issues with discharges to the Loughmore Canal that will address sources of***

***discharges and engagement to date with those responsible, awareness among businesses in***

***Raheen Business Park with the issues and involvement of the IDA and EPA in finding a solution.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council currently have a live investigation underway following a

complaint received in the Environmental Enforcement Section of Limerick City and County

Council (LCCC) in June 2021. The complaint related to a suspected pollution event from the

storm sewer to the Loughmore Canal. In response, LCCC initiated an investigation into this

complaint as required under the terms of reference of the Local Government (Water

Pollution) Act, 1977.

This investigation has been undertaken with the cooperation of IDA Ireland, the Estate

Manager of the Raheen Industrial Estate. The scope of this investigation includes the

examination of all businesses discharging to the IDA storm sewer from the Business Park

and other businesses and connections on the R526.

Extensive desktop studies, site surveys, dye testing and CCTV surveys have been

undertaken. Additionally substantial sampling was undertaken by LCCC at the discharge

point at the canal. Concurrently the IDA also carried out sampling and flow monitoring at

multiple locations within the business park. Out of hours sampling was also made available

to the landowners to capture unusual events outside of business hours. Of the 40+

parameters being assessed, the results have highlighted a pattern of exceedances in two

parameters.

In Autumn 2022, the IDA carried out further targeted sampling to try and identify a focus

area for the investigation and the results of this were made available to LCCC in February

2023. LCCC are continuing to carry out sampling on a monthly basis at two locations on the

canal in order to monitor the ongoing water quality.

Throughout this investigation, meetings have been scheduled and communications issued

to the EPA, IDA and Landowners on a regular basis to ensure all stakeholders are aware of

the investigation progress.

The IDA and LCCC have been actively engaging with Businesses within the Industrial Estate

to try and establish a possible source of the exceedances and also to highlight awareness of

the issues and ensure correct practices and procedures are in place for the use of Storm

systems.

These communications are still ongoing and will continue until a source/sources of the

exceedances has been located or a resolution identified. LCCC and the IDA are actively

working to establish a long-term solution to this issue.

**REPLY**: The fee charged for road closures for events is the cost of the advertisement of the two

statutory notices in a newspaper.

This cost will vary for each road closure depending on the number of words required in the

removal of additional features. In addition the plan will outline options in various

categories, such as bulrush removal, water levels, invasive alien species, tree management,

community engagement which will require further study and whose implementation will

be dependent on compliance with the Habitats Directive and funding. Once in place the

2023 with a contractor on site in Q1 2024. The proposed works comprise a new landscaped

flood defence embankment to the north of King’s Island with new public lighting and shared

footpath/cycleway. The existing sheet piles will be cut down to ground level and the existing

outer walkway will be resurfaced from the handball alley to Star Rovers FC, where the path

joins the new flood embankment. To the south, the existing quay walls will be upgraded

dog owners to take responsibility for the removal their pets' waste from public places and

dispose of it in a proper manner

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on water***

***quality testing at Loughmore Canal and recent testing results from same.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council and the IDA have undertaken extensive sampling in the

Loughmore canal and within the Industrial estate over the past 18 months. Samples were

tested and compared with the Surface water standards that are presently in place in Ireland

at the European Union and are contain in the ‘European Communities Environmental

Objectives (Surface Water) Regulations 2009 – S.I. No. 272 of 2009, as amended’.

For parameters where there were no emissions limit values in the 2009 Surface Water

Regulations, samples were compared to the limerick set in the EPA document; ‘Parameters

of Water Quality – Interpretation and Standards, Environmental Protection Agency, 2001

(EPA Surface Water Guideline limit)’.

Of the 40+ parameters being assessed, the results have highlighted a pattern of

exceedances in two parameters. LCCC are continuing to sample at two locations in the canal

on a monthly basis to monitor the water quality. The samples to date indicate that there

continues to be exceedances in both parameters. We are actively engaging with the

Businesses in the area and the IDA to try and identify a source of these exceedances.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

***closures for events in the Metropolitan District be immediately abolished.***

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, it was agreed that the Notice of Motion would be taken.

Councillor Kiely highlighted the difficulties that festival organisers and voluntary and community

groups had in accessing information on road closures and the fact that there was no clear policy on

this issue. She referred to the fees charged for road closures, which can be an impediment to groups

arranging events, and bringing footfall into the city. The Members agreed that it was important to

have greater clarity in relation to this area. It was agreed that a Workshop would be arranged for

Members.

been carried out at this location and highlighted that there were still ongoing issues with speeding

in the area.

**REPLY**: LCCC Roads have recently installed significant safety measures on the R512 at the Cat’s

Cradle, Ballyneety in recent months. These new measures will need to be reviewed over a

period of time to determine their impact on road safety. It is not envisaged to implement

any further measures at this point. In conjunction with these new safety improvements

LCCC Roads have also contacted the Gardaí to review speed enforcement at this location.

**19.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne (to be referred to the Climate Action,**

**Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***if any staff redundancies are planned for St. Vincent's Lisnagry Special Needs School in Limerick***

***by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for the upcoming school year 2023/2024,***

***and to request that all measures are taken to ensure no redundancies are made at this school.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Pond and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the detrimental effect that any redundancies

would have on staff, parents and children attending the school. Members supported the Motion

and agreed the importance of providing the necessary resources required at the school, which was

catering to some of the most vulnerable members of society.

**21.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan outlined his frustration at the lack of engagement and

responsibility taken by the University of Limerick in relation to this issue and their general

maintenance responsibilities. He noted the recent work carried out on the submerged bench,

which had made it safer for swimmers, and thanked the staff of Limerick City and County Council

for carrying out this work.

**REPLY**: In the interests of urgency and public safety, LCCC Roads have recently completed the

removal of the submerged bench in the Shannon at the bathing area known as “sandy” at

UL as requested. However, ultimately LCCC Roads deem that any maintenance issues in this

area along the River Shannon such as the above should be dealt directly by the ESB or UL

under their own property maintenance.

**22.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir (to be referred to the**

**Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

It was agreed that both Motions would be taken together. The Notices of Motion were proposed

by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin referred to the shock and sadness that was felt

following the recent fire at the Sailors Home and the key role that it had played in the cultural life

of Limerick. The Members agreed that it was very disappointing to hear the news of the fire and

the damage inflicted on the building. They agreed the importance of close co-operation between

the local authority and the building owners to ensure that everything would be done to restore the

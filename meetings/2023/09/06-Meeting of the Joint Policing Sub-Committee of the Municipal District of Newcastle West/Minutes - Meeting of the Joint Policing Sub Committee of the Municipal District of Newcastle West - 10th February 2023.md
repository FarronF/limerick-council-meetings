The Acting Superintendent outlined the number of Mandatory Intoxicant Testing checkpoints

carried out in the District last year. She also stated there was an increase in Garda patrols in

Abbeyfeale and a significant increase in Garda patrols in Newcastle West.

The Members referred to a number of matters including the frequent turnover of Gardaí and

Superintendents assigned to the Newcastle West District as continuity is required in order to

progress policing plans. Reference was also made to the incidents which took place on Halloween

night in Newcastle West, Garda patrols in the District, e-scooters on footpaths, burglaries,

anti-social behaviour, go-safe van and speeding at Feohanagh village, incidents of assault causing

incidents to the Gardaí.

In replying, the Acting Superintendent stated that education in our schools is ongoing and that

legislation on the use of e-scooters is required. In response to a query on the increase in assault

causing harm, Sergeant Fitzsimons stated that this increase may be attributed to increased

socialising taking place again following Covid19. In replying to a query raised on the increase in

drug statistics, Sergeant Cummins made reference to the drugs unit in operation in the District

which is currently dealing with detection of drugs, sale and supply.

The Acting Superintendent also stated that Garda patrols and speed checks have been carried

out in Feohanagh village and that Go Safe Vans are being operated by a private company.

In replying to a request received for an update on the provision of a new District Garda

Headquarters in Newcastle West, the Acting Superintendent responded by saying that a planning

application has been submitted for the construction of a new District Garda Headquarters in

Newcastle West and this application is currently being considered.

A query was also raised in relation to the number of Garda Reserves available in Limerick City and

County and to the number of Garda Reserves on duty on Halloween Night in Newcastle West. A

discussion took place on this matter and Sergeant Cummins gave an overview of the situation on

Halloween night. Following discussion, it was agreed to revert to the Members on the number

of the Garda Reserves in the District.

The Cathaoirleach and Members acknowledged the work of An Garda Síochána and thanked the

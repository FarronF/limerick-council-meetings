1. Planning Environment and Place-Making

**To highlight the importance and need for the Southern Distributor Road as shown in the**

**current Newcastle West Local Area Plan and to also ensure it is included in the new**

**proposed Local Area Plan 2023 to 2029.**

At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Meeting. He outlined how crucial

the distributor road is to the development of Newcastle West and to ensure efficient traffic

flow around the environs. He stated that if the Distributor road is kept in the new Local Area

Plan then funding will be found, he also outlined that he believed that cycling and walking

infrastructure could be incorporated into this road with linkages into the town. This would be

more preferable than digging up streets within the town that struggle with the current car

traffic not to mind cycle infrastructure.

Councillor Ruddle added that creating cycle infrastructure on streets like Maiden Street and

Bridge Street is going to cost huge money and is going to inconvenience road users for roads

that were originally designed for a horse and cart, not a cycle lane and a car. He outlined at

the very least we should cost a distributor road as this opens up a huge pocket of land for---

mixed use and development. Councillor Ruddle added that Newcastle West needs to be

ambitious and we should aim to be a business hub outside of Limerick City. He stated that

Raheen is full to capacity and people want to move out of the city to work, Abbeyfeale has

been allocated €15 million for public realm so Newcastle West should also be getting funds.

He went on to add that in the current plan there is less car parking spaces being made

available in The Square – he added that on Monday to Thursday the elderly population in the

area are keeping the town going and parking spaces need to be provided for them.

Councillor Galvin added that a Ring road is required for Newcastle West, this would open up

land for further development. He added that cycle lanes in the town are welcomed but

questioned if there was room for them – he stated that the streets were old and may not be

able to accommodate further lanes. He added that we needed to listen to public opinion with

regards the layout of the streets. He also added that he was of the opinion that if the

Distributor road was being progressed, it would open up the Southern Side of the town for

development. He closed saying if we wanted to encourage people to do business in West

Limerick following the completion of the Adare Bypass then this is a key requirement.

The Senior Planner from Planning, Environment and Place-making noted that public

consultation has taken place for this Plan. Pre-draft consultation was welcomed and noted

the poor attendance at the public meeting held in February.

The Senior Engineer from Transportation and Mobility outlined that Limerick City and County

Council are guided by national priorities and it was felt that a bypass of the town would be

more beneficial as it would take over 65% of the traffic away from the town. He outlined that

the connections around the town were actually very good, just over congested at present.

He further discussed the proposed linking up of the road from the Woodfield Estate.

Councillor Collins asked if the Southern Distributor Road could be put back into the Local Area

Plan. The Senior Planner from Planning, Environment and Place-making stated that it could

be, but the government look for value for money and this could affect the bypass being

progressed.

Councillor Collins closed stating that the District was plodding along with the understanding

that the Distributor Road was being progressed in the background and now it is off the plan.

He stated he believes the town needs a distributor road to the south and the north and he

feels it should not be either or in relation to a bypass.

The Senior Engineer, Transportation and Mobility closed assuring the Councillors that the

South West pocket of Newcastle West is crucial to Limerick City and County Council and

believed a distributor road through the Woodfield estate will remove a lot of the issues.---

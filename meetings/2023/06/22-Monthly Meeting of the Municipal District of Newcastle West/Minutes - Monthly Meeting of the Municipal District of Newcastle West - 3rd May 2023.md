REPLY:

The Dog Wardens carry out patrols in Newcastle West as resources allow. Enforcement

activity is driven by complaints received through CRM and the capture of stray dogs.

Owners are required under the Dog Control Act to have their dogs under “Effectual Control”.

Dogs are only required to be on leads if they are restricted breeds as defined in the Act.

All dog licence holders are sent a reminder on the duties as a dog owner when the renew

their dog licence. This includes highlighting their responsibilities on Dog Control and on

cleaning up after their dog.

A joint operation between the Gardaí and Dog Wardens has been organised to target the

Newcastle West Greenway entrance to both enforce and raise awareness of Dog Control

responsibilities along the route. We intend to repeat this a number of times a year.

There is a new Dog Control Working Group which has been established by the Minister of

Agriculture, Food and Marine and we await their final recommendations and anticipate that

there will be many positive changes recommended which will help Local Councils in enforcing

dog control in their functional areas.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins referred to a dangerous breed of dog which was

roaming freely on the Limerick Greenway at Newcastle West and requested that dog owners

be made aware of their responsibilities to keep dogs on leads when in a public area. A brief

discussion followed and reference was also made to dangerous breeds of dogs being kept in

Local Authority housing which is of concern to residents. It was agreed that the Meetings

Administrator would revert to the relevant Directorate on this matter.

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would place the new***

***playground in Tournafulla on the list to be insured under its property portfolio.***

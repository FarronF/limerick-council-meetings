***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council***

***reconsider my original proposal to introduce stickers on illegally parked cars throughout the city.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin highlighted the illegal parking that is occurring in

loading bays and on footpaths around the city of Limerick. He pointed out the benefits, if the

introduction of stickers on vehicles was considered, and stated it would also act as a visual

deterrent.

**REPLY**: Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 2022 and as amended by Section 15 of the Road Traffic

Act 2006 of the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975 provides the Council’s Traffic

Wardens with the legal basis to issue fixed charge notices to illegally parked cars and to affix

such a notice to the vehicle. These notices are bright yellow tickets which are usually placed

under a windscreen wiper. There is no legal basis for the Council’s Traffic Wardens to affix

stickers to vehicles and these would be prohibited under the provisions of the Litter

Pollution Acts, 1997 - 2009. The Traffic Section will examine the use of adhesive holders for

parking notices for use in limited circumstances, these would be larger and more noticeable

than the notice itself.

**REPLY**: The lane behind the Dochas offices is property registered to Limerick City and County

Council but is not a public road. In order to enforce double yellow lines along this laneway

it must first be taken in charge as a public road. The Council will examine if this laneway is

suitable for taking in charge, this would be subject to a survey, availability of funding to

remedy defects, advertisement of a notice of the intention of the Council to take in charge

the laneway. It would also require formal consideration by Councillors.

Members queried if the process to take this lane in charge could be started, and in response, the

Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing, noted he would carry out a survey of the

lane which is required for the Taken in Charge process.

**Item 5: Questions from PPN Linkage Group**

Question 1

An update on social and affordable housing delivery in 2022 and if targets were met and budgets

spent, with particular reference to the Traveller housing budget.

Response

Ms. Helen Creed, Administrative Officer, Housing provided an update to the members as follows:

Our build target was 565 builds in 2022 so therefore we met 71% of our target (399/565). The target

is 2693 homes by 2026 (5-Year Target). This target is a build target only.

In 2022, a total of 472 homes were delivered through new build (399 homes), acquisitions (39

homes) and leasing (34 homes).  The 2022 out turn is undergoing final review with the Department

of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has mandated a target blend whereby

LCCC to deliver 60% direct and 40% delivery by AHB sector.

Delivery Challenges which affected the 2022 out turn were beyond the control of Limerick City and

County Council and include:



Covid lockdown and site closures



Impact of Brexit



Ukrainian Crisis



Material delivery delays to site which affected our completion dates



Material and labour cost inflation issues – required resubmission of funding applications to

DHLGH to approve and this delayed process

Affordable

Limerick City and County Council undertook 3 affordable campaigns in 2022 seeking residential

developments with planning permissions for affordable purchase. A fourth Affordable Campaign will

be advertised by the end of April 2023.

The Council progressed 5 Council owned sites under the serviced sites fund and the affordable

housing fund. In addition, we advanced a joint venture with Cluid/Whitebox on 3 City centre sites.

Affordable Housing Delivery for Limerick 2022-2026

1272 units (688+584) in pipeline as at March 2023. Table 1 above shows expected handover dates by

year of units.

54% of pipeline = Cost Rental. Typically apartment typologies in Metro District

46% of pipeline = Affordable Purchase. Typically 3 or 4 bed homes.

Ms. Patricia Phillips, A/Head of Unit for Housing Welfare & Traveller Accommodation provided an

update on the Traveller Housing Budget. A discussion took place and An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen

Keary asked Ms. Phillips what the capital works entailed and if there is any housing for travellers

under construction at present.

Ms. Patricia Phillips advised that capital funding can be used for new Traveller accommodation,

refurbishment of existing accommodation, caravan loans, site improvement and so on. Ms. Phillips

informed Cllr. Keary that LCCC are currently looking at 2 houses in the Askeaton area and 2 houses in

the City.

Cllr. Ruddle enquired how the allocation process worked and Ms. Phillips explained same.

Ms. Anne Cronin queried the target number of 105 for the traveller accommodation programme and

enquired if it was reflective of the number of the travelling community on the waiting list. Ms.

Phillips advised that the numbers can fluctuate with numbers travelling between Counties at any

one time. Ms. Phillips advised that the targets are reviewed in line with the traveller

accommodation programme.

**Question 2**

*Status of LDA developments in Limerick and impact of timelines being pushed out on housing delivery*

*targets in Limerick*

Ms. Helen Creed, Administrative Officer, Housing provided the following update to the members.

LCCC in partnership with LDA continue state-led master-planning, infrastructure planning and land

acquisitions which ‘de-risks’ complex sites such as Carey's Road District as part of the Colbert

Quarter Masterplan.

Following the adoption of Colbert Quarter Spatial Framework, the Council signed an MOU in

September 2022 with the LDA to advance the delivery of mixed-tenure on Council owned and other

State-owned lands at Colbert Quarter which will deliver approximately 2,500 new homes

overall.  This is a complex process with numerous stakeholders (HSE, CIE, LCCC) and constraints such

as reviewing existing operations on site that may need relocation. This is particularly relevant for the

CIE and HSE lands and hence why this process will take longer as indicated in the Minister's Report

on Relevant Public Lands.

The LDA and LCCC have a working group and steering group structure where we are

currently focusing on advancing a key work package for a phase 1 residential-led scheme on land

south of Carey’s Road for approximately 270 units. We are programming an expected delivery date

of 2026 and this is indicated in the Housing Delivery Action Plan for Limerick.

Cllr. Keary asked how far was Carey’s Road District proposal away from a planning application. Ms.

Curley advised that it’s a complex process with numerous stakeholders and we are programming an

expected delivery date of the Colbert Quarter in 2026. Ms. Curley informed the committee that

following the Land Development Agency’s report on Relevant Public Land and further consideration

by the Minister that LCCC hopes to see opportunities in the coming months for future development

to deliver affordable and social housing.

Cllr. Kiely enquired about lands on the Dock Road and if there is any update on the CIE site where

the boundary is being breached. Cllr. Kiely stated the Guinness site on Upper Carey’s Road needs to

be cleaned up. Ms. Curley informed Cllr. Kiely that CIE site is still in the ownership of the CIE and that

LCCC will look into the Guinness site.

**Item 6: Tenant in Situ Scheme**

Ms. Caroline Curley, Director of Service, Housing provided an introduction to the Tenant in Situ

Scheme.

Ms. Helen Creed, Administrative Officer, Housing provided additional information to the Committee

on LCCC’s response for persons/households who have received a Notice to Quit (NTQ) and have no

alternative accommodation.

A discussion took place and members had a number of questions:

Cllr. Kiely enquired about the number of households with an NTQ that LCCC are dealing with and if

more resources are required. Cllr. Kiely enquired about acquiring tenant-in-situ properties in poor

condition and is there an increase in the maintenance budget?

Cllr. Benson highlighted that we need more staff resources to process the queries and asked if

housing delivery targets would be impacted by the surge in households receiving NTQ’s. Cllr. Benson

enquired about funding for repairs and the potential impact on the maintenance budget. Cllr.

Benson asked about unit cost ceilings for acquisitions and the income threshold for the cost rental

scheme.

Cllr. Conor Sheehan asked when LCCC received the revised tenant in situ circular, what discussions

took place in respect of additional staff and what is the criteria for households above the social

housing income threshold. Cllr. Sheehan asked if we could proceed to acquire apartments to prevent

homelessness where the household is approved for a larger bed-type. Cllr. Sheehan enquired about

all supports available to households.

Cllr. Keary asked if rent credits are available and for clarity on the income threshold for the Cost

Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme. Cllr. Keary asked if there are many applications for the Tenant in situ

scheme and the acquisition target of 75 and highlighted that the Government need to increase the

numbers. Cllr. Keary stated that LCCC should not be covering refurbishment costs and enquired

about HAP tenants not approved on the social housing waiting list. Cllr Keary asked how long a

tenant has to vacate a property when issued an NTQ.

In response to the members queries Ms. Curley confirmed that LCCC are managing the volume of

work at present. Ms. Curley informed the members that where a landlord wants to sell to LCCC with

a tenant in situ the Council will progress same promptly to put the household who has received the

notice to quit at ease. Ms Curley advised that the properties should be in a good condition and LCCC

will seek additional funding for refurbishment from the DHLGH where required. Mr. Curley advised

that the number of bedrooms would not prevent LCCC from acquiring a house to support

households to prevent homelessness. Ms. Curley advised that the net annual income must be below

€53,000 to be considered for the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme (CRTiS) and the scheme is

managed by the housing agency.

Mr. Curley confirmed that the initial allocation for the number of acquisitions that can be funded is

75 and advised that it’s not a target but to allow local authorities to prioritise the acquisitions to be

targeted.

Ms. Creed provided additional information on the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme (CRTiS) and

advised that the Government plans to enact legislation providing a “Purchase under First Right of

Refusal” and it is planned that the “First Homes (Shared Equity) Scheme” will be amended to extend

eligibility for the scheme to those with notices to quit. Ms. Creed also informed the members that

some tenants who have received a NTQ may be eligible to apply for a Local Authority Home Loan

once they meet the criteria.

Ms. Phillips added that a HAP place finder service is available within LCCC to assist households at

immediate risk of homelessness. Ms. Phillips also advised that the Homeless Action Team works

very closely with Housing Allocations to support households. Ms. Curley advised that in order to

qualify for social housing supports you must be eligible and in need of social housing.

Ms. Anne Cronin enquired about the numbers communicated in terms of trajectory of NTQ’s ahead.

Ms. Creed advised that the number of households contacting the Council has risen significantly since

the announcement of the ending of the winter eviction ban. Ms. Creed advised that in October 2022

the Housing Directorate were dealing with 22 Notices to Quit and at 12th April we had 257. Ms.

Creed confirmed that the figure is inclusive of proposals received before 1st April, 2023.

Cllr. Collopy queried whether rent paid over a period of time is considered in a situation where a

long term tenant approaches the Council to purchase the property. Ms. Curley replied that rent paid

is not taken into account and that the level of discount available is related to income and subject to

meeting other criteria for the tenant purchase scheme.

**Item 7: AOB**

Housing Commission Public Consultation.

Ms. Helen Creed, Administrative Officer, Housing informed the group that the Housing Commission

recently launched a public consultation running from Tuesday 21st March 2023 until Tuesday 18th

April 2023 seeking views on the housing system in Ireland.

**Water Quality Issues in Foynes**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Members of the Water Services Department and Duane

O’Brien from Uisce Éireann to the Special Meeting to discuss water quality issues in

Foynes.

At the outset of the Meeting, Director, National and Regional Shared Services gave

Members a presentation in relation to the Shannon Estuary Water Scheme and the

recent discovery of cryptosporidium detected during routine water testing on the 11th

May explaining that following a second cryptosporidium positive test and consultation

with the Health Service Executive a Boil Water Notice was issued on the 13th May.

Mr O’Brien, Uisce Éireann advised Members that although the Health Service Executive

had not reported any illness relating to the cryptosporidium detection a Boil Water

Notice was put in place as a precaution to protect public health and added upgrade

works are ongoing in the Shannon Estuary Water Plant at the present time and the Boil

Water Notice will be in place until all remedial works are complete and the Health

Service Executive have been advised.

Discussion ensued and Members raised the following concerns:

 Councillor O’Brien noted the lack of information and updates provided to

members of the public in particular immunocompromised and also added the

cost implication for households as well as businesses to have to now purchase

bottled water while the Boil Water Notice remains in effect is extensive. Mr

O’Brien, Uisce Éireann advised approximately 7,000 customers are currently

affected and regular updates are provided on local media outlets as well as on
---
Uise Éireann’s website www.water.ie. He further advised vulnerable customer

who have registered their details with Uisce Éireann will be directly contacted.

 Councillor Sheahan queried if water tankers would be provided for customers

who are affected by the Boil Water Notice, however, the Director, National and

Regional Shared Services advised the Health Service Executive advise would

require customers still having to boil the water these tankers would provide.

 Councillor Collins queried if a UV filter would work in domestic households to

prevent bacteria from getting into their water. The Senior Engineer, Water

Services advised the UV filter will stop the cryptosporidium bacteria from

reproducing but it would not remove it from the household water supply.

The A/Senior Executive Officer, Water Services concluded that a Councillor Clinic would

be held with Uisce Éireann shortly and encouraged Members to submitted any questions

or concerns they might have. Uisce Éireann would endeavor to issue a direct response

to any issues raised.

This concluded the Meeting.

NOTICES OF MOTION

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that an

acceptable level of maintenance be carried out at Kilmallock Business Park and that the

Business Park becomes a priority for this Local Authority in order to keep the existing

businesses and to encourage other businesses to establish there.
---
**Reply:**

Kilmallock Business Park was acquired by Limerick City and County Council in early 2020

prior to Covid. The Municipal District Office assumed management of Park in March

2020. It should be noted that under-investment in the Park prior to takeover by LCCC

has led to significant infrastructural and maintenance issues to be dealt with. Since

assuming responsibility for the park, the MD office has extended the service level

agreement in place with Kilmallock Tourism to maintain the green areas within the

business park. There were also submissions made for funding to carry out infrastructural

improvements. In 2023, the following works are scheduled to be completed. The surface

of all existing footpaths within the park will be replaced. In addition, all the public

lighting in the park will be upgraded and the vegetation that currently surrounds the

lights will be substantially cut back or removed if required. The MD office is keen to

maintain the business park to a high standard, but resources are limited. It must be

noted that substantial additional Capital investment is still required to upgrade other

infrastructure within the Park. The maintenance fees that are contributed by the

individual companies in the Business Park can only cover day to day maintenance.

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

***The Elected Members requested that a representative from Innovate Limerick attend a***

***monthly meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District to discuss marketing***

***of Kilmallock Business Park. They would also like to acknowledge the work already***

***undertaken by Limerick City and County Council and Kilmallock Tourism at the Business***

***Park.***

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District calling on

Limerick City and County Council to compulsory purchase order land that is near

Athenacey Cemetery with a view to constructing a suitable parking area.

**Reply:**

The Council are aware of the concerns of both the Elected members and the public

regarding parking at Athenacey Cemetery. To this end, the Council will investigate

options to facilitate parking at the cemetery and will revert on the matter in due course.
---
***The Elected Members requested that a representative from the Burial Grounds section***

**The Questions were taken as read**

Any Other Business

 A question was raised as to the issue of littering at the bottle bank in Bruree and

what could be done to prevent further littering. The Elected Members were advised

that a National Scheme regarding CCTV for littering is to be developed but that it

could be a further 6 to 12 months before the Local Authority will be able to

implement actions from the scheme and the threshold for implementation will be

high. In the meantime, it was suggested that an awareness raising campaign and

signage could be a proactive step to take, and to note that the Environment section

are aware of the issue and engaging as appropriate.

 A recent LCDC meeting was referenced whereby Mr V Murray, Director of Services

for Planning, Environment and Placemaking, presented information on his role and

the work of his department. It was suggested that all Directors of Service should

present such information to the general public once per year. The Elected Members

were referred to the Limerick.ie for the range of information available there also.

 The Elected Members wished to acknowledge the workshop delivered by Water

services regarding the waste water issue in Kilbehenny. A proposal was made that

Uisce Eireann be invited to meet with representatives from the community of

Kilbehenny. It was noted that at the workshop with Water services, Director of

Services, K Lehane, outlined that it was important to identify what the community of
---
Kilbehenny need Limerick City and County Council to do. It was agreed that the

Meetings administrator would follow up with Uisce Eireann to seek a reply to the

correspondence sent on 25th April, and further to that reply, possibly request that a

representative from Uisce Eireann meet with representatives from the community of

Kilbehenny.

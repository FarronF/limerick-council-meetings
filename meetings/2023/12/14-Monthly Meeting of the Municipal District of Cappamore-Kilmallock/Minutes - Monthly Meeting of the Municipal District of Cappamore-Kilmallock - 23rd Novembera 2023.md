NOTICES OF MOTION

5.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that this

Local Authority explore parking facilities at the old quarry at Tankardstown, Kilmallock

which would serve as a car park for Tankardstown Graveyard.

**Reply:**

Tankardstown Graveyard is an ancient graveyard of Medieval Origin accessed via private

lands, like many other ancient graveyards around the County. There is currently no policy

for provision of carparks at these locations, nor is there funding available for same.

Limerick City and County Council to:

 Prioritize the development of the Stone Mansion House in Kilmallock as an

Interpretative Centre.

 Assign a directorate that will be responsible for the development and work with

Kilmallock Tourism Development Ltd and other stake holders.

**Reply:**

The Council will explore potential funding streams to deliver a project on the site in

conjunction with relevant stakeholders. The Council has recently appointed a Town

Regeneration Officer who will work with the local community to advance the proposals.

I will ask at the next Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District meeting what the possibility is

of widening the Spittle junction outside Ballylanders where the R513 and the L85251 meet.

**Reply:**

The Municipal District office will review the R513/L185251 junction and determine

improvements that may be necessary at this junction. It should be noted that funding would

need to be provided outside of the approved MD budget to cover any works that may be

required.

l will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for feedback

on the possibility of footpath repair and public lighting on the Charleville Road, R515 from

Glen Grove, Kilmallock to Portauns.

**Reply:**

The Municipal District office will prepare a report and cost estimate for footpath repairs and

public lighting on the R515 from Glen Grove to Portauns. Any proposed works would be

subject to appropriate project specific funding being allocated.

**The Questions were taken as read.**---

supported.

In response Ms. Fennessy advised that she would provide the number of Limerick participants during

the pilot phase and the number of households who participated in the rightsizing scheme after the

SPC.

Ms. Fennessy explained that there are a number of referral pathways such as self-referral and

external referrals such as family/friends, health services, elected representative, community groups

etc.

Cllr. Sharon Benson enquired (a) how many disabled persons grant applications did the Healthy Age

Friendly Homes team assist with in Limerick (b) if there is something the Council can do to make

older local Authority tenants aware of this programme.

Ms. Fennessy advised that she would revert to the committee on the number of participants they

assisted with for Disabled Persons Grants. Ms. Fennessy confirmed that the Healthy Age Friendly

Homes team can liaise with Housing Support Services in contacting the relevant local authority

tenants to make them aware of the supports available.

Cllr. Tom Ruddle enquired how participants are prioritised considering there are only two co-

ordinators allocated to Limerick City and County Council Health Age Friendly Homes Programme.

Ms. Fennessy informed the committee that referrals are dealt with in date order unless there is

additional information on the referral form for example in relation to a health priority. Ms. Fennessy

advised that priority participants are included in weekly visits.

programme is funded by the Department of Health and operated by Age Friendly Ireland hosted in

Meath County Council on behalf of Local Government.

Ms. Fennessy advised that a coordinators background is generally in Health or Housing, that the post

is analogous to an administrative officer’s post, that mileage is allowed for from their local authority

base. Ms. Fennessy advised that the programme was examined by the Department of Health and

Department of Housing and Local Government and while certain services were already being

provided by organisations there was a need for an innovative supported coordination of services.

**Item 4: Rent Pressure Zone**

Ms Mary Hayes, Senior Executive Officer gave a presentation on “Rent Pressure Zones”. The

presentation was well received by the committee.

A discussion took place. Ms. Dee Ryan, CEO, Limerick Chamber of Commerce asked (a) what is the

role of the Local Authority in the administration of this. Ms Ryan added that Limerick Chamber are

monitoring rents and residential availability very closely in Limerick. Ms. Ryan advised that the

September report highlights that the average rent in September was €1,600.00 and only 49 homes

circulate the report and would welcome the opportunity for Limerick Chamber to present their

findings at the next SPC.

schemes.

For noting report to SPC from Housing Disability Strategic Group.

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at the beginning of the year based on a

planned programme of work. Ms. Hayes confirmed that there was a further funding submission

made to the Department in June based on the number of applications to hand.

Ms. Hayes stated that Limerick City and County Council can apply for additional funding throughout

letter on the 11th September 2023 regarding the Council’s Tenure Mix Policy to Councillors and the

Executive. Ms. Ryan advised that the Chamber awaits a response. Ms. Ryan highlighted that the

Chamber has requested that Councillors examine the tenure mix policy set out in the current

Development Plan.

Ms. Ryan highlighted a specific development in Castletroy and Limerick Chambers concerns on the

lack of availability of housing for purchase or rent to the private market given its’ proximity to the

technological park and the University.

Cllr. Sharon Benson advised that we shouldn’t focus on one particular site in isolation and stated

that there was significant demand for cost rental in the Castletroy area.

Cllr. James Collins stated that the Affordable Purchase Scheme needs to be more effective. Cllr.

Collins highlighted that developers can’t make it work under the current Affordable scheme and

that’s why the uptake hasn’t been great. Cllr. Collins suggested that Affordable Housing and the

issues around it should be an agenda item for the next SPC.

Cllr. Leddin informed the committee that the elected members were having a Tenure Mix Policy

workshop on the 20th October, 2023. Cllr. Leddin stated that any revisions to the Tenure Mix Policy

could impact approved planning applications.

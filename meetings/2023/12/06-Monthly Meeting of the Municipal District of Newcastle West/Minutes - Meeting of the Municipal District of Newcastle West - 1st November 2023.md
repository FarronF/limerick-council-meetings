QUESTIONS

10.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** **for a detailed report as to when the long overdue repairs are**

**to be carried out in the Graveyard (Abbey) wall in The Square, Abbeyfeale.**---
6

REPLY:

The Council held a procurement process to seek contractors to carry out the repair works

required on the graveyard wall in Abbeyfeale. This tender also included the repairs required

to two burial tombs adjacent to the wall. The tenders were assessed and a contractor was

identified for these restoration works. However, the contractor has since withdrawn his

tender and has advised that he is not in a position to undertake the works. The next tender

price for the works is of the order of €93,000, which appears excessive and not considered

value for money for the tendered works.

In addition, the Council have recently been advised by the National Monuments Service, that

the Council will require the use of a Conservation Engineer approved by the National

Monuments Service for these works. The National Monuments Service require that a

conservation method statement be prepared by an accredited Conservation Engineer for

approval by NMS and that all the works be designed, managed and overseen on site by a

suitably qualified conservation professional.

The requirements as outlined by the NMS will require the Council to retender the works and

in advance of same to engage a Conservation Engineer to act as designer and oversee the

entire project.

The Meetings Administrator gave a further update which issued from the relevant Directorate

stating that it is anticipated that these works will be retendered in Q2 2024.

11.Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next*** ***Meeting*** ***that the Council lay double white lines at the Forge Cross***

***heading from Templeglantine towards Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

This location was recently brought to our attention and we contacted the TII Design Project

Manager with responsibility for road markings on this road. Below is the response received:

The delineation markings on the N21 were designed and installed in accordance with the DoT

Traffic Signs Manual. A full N21 route review and design was carried out to ensure consistency

along the entirety of the route. It is my understanding that the current delineation layout

involves a warning line, which is the appropriate line-type in these circumstances.

Please note that design standards can change from time to time and all routes are subject to

review every 3 to 5 years (budget depending). TII will take note of this location and ensure it

is reviewed and included in the next review. Should this identify any amendments or changes

we will of course implement these.

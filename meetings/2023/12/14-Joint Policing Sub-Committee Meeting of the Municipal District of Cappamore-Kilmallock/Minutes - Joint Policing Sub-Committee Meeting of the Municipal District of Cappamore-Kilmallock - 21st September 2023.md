It was noted that there was a spike in thefts from shops in Kilmallock compared to last year,

but that the majority of cases have now been solved or are being finalised.

Theft from other properties and sale & supply of drugs have also increased.

There were no robberies from the person.

In relation to Fraud/Economic crime, it was noted that the Crime Prevention Officer, Bernie

Leach, had been actively engaging with the media to ensure the public were aware of the

threat.

A University of Limerick initiative is providing a course focusing on Road Safety.

Mandatory alcohol and drug testing check points are being undertaken, along with 74 other

checkpoints and over 2000 patrols.

**Anti social Behaviour**

In relation to the antisocial behaviour in Kilmallock involving the taking and burning of cars,

investigations are ongoing and arrests have been made. There has been an increase in patrols

in the area.

A new operation is being established over 8 weeks targeting antisocial behaviour. Patrols will

be in place over Halloween and in the build up to Halloween.

There will also be an education initiative with schools outlining the importance of respect for

the community.

The Elected Members outlined the negative publicity and fear in the community caused by

antisocial behaviour, and wanted to acknowledge the work undertaken by An Garda Siochana

to target this.

Superintendent Kennedy advised that he would welcome feedback from the Elected Members

as to which locations required patrols. In relation to the thefts from businesses, it was noted

that the perpetrators tended to cross county boundaries and were generally opportunistic.

**Speed**

Speed in Bruff, Bruree, Kilmallock and Elton was highlighted by the Elected Members. The

speed limit review was welcomed, as were the Taoiseach’s comments regarding road safety.

**Domestic Abuse**

The Elected Members highlighted how important it was for visability of the Gardai in rural

areas especially in the dark evenings, and a question was raised in relation to what the

incidence of reported domestic abuse was in the year to date.

Superintendent Kennedy outlined that the Gardai are dealing with domestic abuse cases on a

daily basis, and it is treated with seriousness and follow through.

**New Rosters**

The new system for rosters for the Gardai was outlined. It will start to be implemented from

6th November and priority will be a front line presence.

**Juvenile diversion and prevention**

It was noted that although there are no official figures to provide relating to Juvenile

prevention and diversion, from experience it can be seen to be very successful. It has proven to

be both economically and socially beneficial. The Foroige juvenile diversion programme also

takes referrals from schools.

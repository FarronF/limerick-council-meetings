**7.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will again ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a date to when***

***the Peter McVerry houses will be starting in Carew Park Limerick.***

**REPLY**: The Peter McVerry Trust have advised the Council that they will not be in a position to

complete out this project and the Council have commenced discussions with them in terms

of the transfer of the scheme to the Council. Until the project is handed over to Limerick

City and County Council, we will not be in a position to confirm the start date.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to the flooding***

***that occurred on Hyde Road on the morning of Friday 20th of October;***

***(a)***

***What was the main cause for the flooding that occurred on the Hyde Road and inner roads***

***on that date.***

***(b)***

***What was the subsequent work that was carried out on Monday 23rd October 2023 to***

***prevent further flooding in this area.***

***(c)***

***(d)***

***Did the recent changes to the main Hyde Road layout contribute in any way to the build-***

***up of water on the actual main road surface.***

**REPLY**: a) On that particular day there was intense excessive rainfall that overwhelmed the

drainage system for a period of time. On the inner or parallel road to Hyde Road a blockage

was discovered in the existing drainage.

b) Water was pumped from the affect area to allow access to a gully. The gully was

excavated and a camera was placed in the pipe to investigate the issue. A blockage,

consisting of debris and plastic bottles was discovered in the outfall pipeline for the gully.

The pipeline was jetted and cleaned of debris and the gully was reinstated.

c) Now with the gully and pipeline cleaned and functioning properly there should be no

further instance at this location.

d) The existing road surface along Hyde Road was planed and removed and a new surface

re-laid. A number of the drainage gullies are higher than the new surface and area due to

be reset to the required level to provide positive drainage for the road.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on numbers***

***of Council owned derelict and vacant houses in Limerick City West and timeframe plans to***

***upgrade and relet.***

**REPLY**: There are a total of 44 vacant dwellings currently in Metro West. The average timeframe

for completion is the end of April 2024 based on current status.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**
---
5

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to extend winter closing***

***time of the People's Park to 5.30pm and confirm why the closing times for the Baggott Estate are***

***not being adhered to.***

**REPLY**: The closing times for all Parks are set at particular times throughout the year and change

according to day light hours during the summer and winter periods. While it could be

considered to extend the closing times every week by 15mins, this also means that the

opening times would be pushed out by 15mins as the Park Rangers are rostered to work a

certain number of hours every day. This would also be very confusing for the public. The

closing times are therefore set in blocks of weeks throughout the year and in general

change when the clocks go forward or back.

It is considered that the current opening and closing times throughout the year is

reasonable. It is acknowledged that there are a few situations where it may not be

considered dark when the Parks are being closed but this is only for a very short period of

time.

In relation to Baggott Estate, it appears that the gates were not being closed within the

one-hour window that is allowed in the contract for the contractor to have all gates closed.

A meeting has been held with the contractor and it is our understanding that this has now

been rectified.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to clarify plans for the next***

***phase of the public realm upgrade of O'Connell Street and if funding has been secured from the***

***EU or Nationally.***

**REPLY**: The Council is examining preliminary design options for O’Connell Street in conjunction with

Transport and Mobility Department and National Transport Authority. Funding is to be

provided under Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF) and National Transport

Authority. No EU funding has been identified.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when the Council is going***

***to appoint a full-time traffic warden specifically for the housing estates near the University of***

***Limerick to tackle the parking issues in the area, following the motion passed in this regard in***

***March of this year.***

**REPLY**: In late October the Council assigned a Traffic Warden on a temporary basis to the Annacotty

depot. This Traffic Warden is now patrolling residential areas throughout the city focusing

on those which experience high levels of illegal parking, for example near third level colleges

including the University of Limerick.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a bus stop and***
---
6

***pedestrian crossing be installed on the Ballysimon Road as soon as possible.***

**REPLY**: The preliminary design of the Ballysimon Road Active Travel Scheme is currently being

undertaken by external consultants. The construction stage is planned to commence in Q4

of 2024 and will include a pedestrian crossing and the provision of a bus shelter and its

associated civil works.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on discussions***

***between the Council and the LEDP on the possibility of the Council acquiring the Market's Field***

***stadium.***

**REPLY**: The Council is continuing its engagements with the LEDP and relevant stakeholders in

relation to the future of the Markets Field Stadium. This has included the new owners of

Treaty United and the FAI. There is no outcome to these at this point, but engagement will

continue with a view to a sustainable outcome.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a progress update on a***

***proposed dog park for Limerick City North in O'Brien Park on Clare Street.***

funding has been identified, procurement for this project can commence.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council correspond with Clare County Council to highlight that the riverbank on the far***

***side of the Castleconnell footbridge is currently blocked, and ask Clare County Council to engage***

***with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that those people that cross the footbridge from***

***Castleconnell have unhindered access to the riverbank on the opposite side.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City & County Council Road’s Operations have formally highlighted this matter to

Clare County Council. Our response has been acknowledged by Clare County Council and

we have requested that we are kept updated on this matter.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council add every***

***estate taken in charge to the grass cutting program where residents do not opt for the***

***maintenance grant, and if there are any estates taken in charge where the residents did not opt***

***for the maintenance grant and where the Council do not cut the grass or cut the grass once a***

***year only. Please provide a list of those estates, if any, and please respond to the specific question***

***asked and do not provide a general statement.***

**REPLY:** The grass in housing estates is either cut by the grass cutting contractor or residents can

avail of a community grant where they arrange the grass cutting themselves. In the event

that the community do not avail of the grant, the estate is added to the grass cutting

contract.

The Council in the first instance, recommend the community grant option as it is not

sustainable to continue adding to the grass cutting contract as there are limited contractors

who have the capacity to undertake the contract for the city and county.

We are not aware of any housing estates that do not fall under either the Community

Grants or the Grass Cutting Contract.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan**District of Limerick for an update on***

***Christmas**in Limerick 2023 including if the Council will engage an external event***

***management**company to run this festival and*** ***if there will be a ceremony**for turning on of the***

***Christmas lights.***

**REPLY**: In line with other large cities and urban areas across the country, there will not be a

ceremony for the switching on of the Christmas lights in the City Centre due to the high

costs associated with managing an event of this scale. It is considered that the Council
---
9

budget available for Christmas in Limerick 2023 is best directed towards achieving the full

itinerary of events that is scheduled for this year including seasonal street shows, Limerick

on Ice, Fossett’s Christmas Circus, Toots the Train and the aerial extravaganza at King John’s

Castle, among other seasonal activities. Christmas in Limerick events will not be managed

by an external event management company in 2023.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the**Metropolitan District of Limerick for any buildings or***

***structures**in the Metropolitan area that have been removed from the record of protected***

***structures**since the development**plan was passed by Councillors**in 2022.***

**REPLY**: No buildings or structures have been removed from the record of protected structures

within the Metropolitan area, since the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 was adopted

by the Elected Members in 2022.

**23.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on funding***

***allocated towards a cricket crease in 2019 and if a site had been identified for same.***

**REPLY:** The Council carried out a review of its green spaces in Limerick City West to see whether

cricket could be accommodated. The space required for a cricket crease is significant, larger

than a GAA pitch. There is no green space available at present that can accommodate a

cricket crease in Limerick City West.

The Regeneration Sports and Recreation Directorate intends to meet with representatives

of Limerick Cricket teams this month on the subject of playing spaces across the City and

County.

**24.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the naming***

***of the new Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road application to the LCCC Civic Memorial Policy to name***

***this road after world famous Limerick rock band, The Cranberries.***

**REPLY:** It is anticipated that the new Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road will be completed by mid-

2025, so the question of naming the road can be considered nearer to the completion date.

Clarification is also currently being sought from the Department of Transport with regard

to clarifying the protocols for naming a newly completed road, and this will assist the

process in the approach to the completion of the road in mid-2025.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council write to Libraries Ireland and The Local Government Management Agency asking***

***them to include labelled sections in all libraries in Ireland for books on Climate Change,***

***Biodiversity and Environmental issues.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Novak Uí

Chonchúir and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan stated that changes to labelling of books should be

carried out in all Libraries nationwide to highlight the importance of climate change and

environmental issues.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Active Travel***

***Team identify and implement contraflow cycle routes to improve cyclability and create a denser***

***cycle network in line with the provisions of the new national cycle manual.***
---
11

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir, seconded by Councillor

Hartigan and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir referred to the Cycle Design Manual and

the benefits of contraflow cycle routes.

**REPLY**: The new Cycle Design Manual (CDM) is looking to delivering cycling infrastructure from

international best practice and has been guided by the need to deliver safe cycle facilities

for people of all ages and abilities.

The new cycle design manual places more emphasis on segregating cyclists from traffic

where speeds and volumes make roads unsuitable for sharing.

The Active Travel Unit will look to utilise the new cycle design manual in identifying and

implementing contraflow cycle routes.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to and ask***

***Education Minister Norma Foley TD:***

***(a) to provide an update on the continued delays for Monaleen N.S. and***

***(b) to ask the Department of Education to approve the Stage 2b Report which they have had on***

***their desks since December last year, so that LCETB can proceed to tender for the appointment of***

***the contractor and begin the school's construction.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the urgent need to progress the extension

project at Monaleen N.S., which had been ongoing for many years. Members supported this

Motion and agreed it has taken too long to progress, given that schools in other sub-urban areas

had already been completed.

**30.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council consider***

***declaring the Metropolitan area a poster free zone during the permitted period in 2024 to prevent***

***a complete proliferation of posters with three elections scheduled in June.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Hartigan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin pointed out that with the number of elections due to

take place in Limerick in 2024, the city will be covered with election posters which are an eyesore

and are unsightly. While he understood that legally these were allowed during the election cycle

period, he noted that if Members collectively voluntarily agreed to declare the Metropolitan area

poster free, it will help improve the visual look of the city, reduce littering and save on the costs of

printing and erecting same.
---
12

Members welcomed this Motion and agreed that with the advent of social media and digital

platforms that physical posters should not need to be used as much, and following a discussion it

was agreed to hold a Workshop to discuss the Motion further.

**REPLY**: The legal requirements in relation to the erection of election posters are set out in the Litter

Pollution Act 1997 (as amended) and the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009, which

provides that posters may only be erected for a certain specified time period before a

polling date and must be removed within 7 days of Polling Day. There are also legal

requirements in place in relation to the proximity of posters being erected near polling

stations, as well as requirements relating to posters not being erected on traffic and road

signs, hanging off bridges, etc. Further draft legislation in relation to this area, namely the

Regulation of Display of Electoral and Polling Posters and Other Advertisements Bill 2022, is

also currently before the Oireachtas.

The current legislation, therefore, allows for posters to be erected during an election period.

However, it is open to the Elected Members of the Metropolitan District to agree not to

erect election posters in the run up to the Local Government Elections in June 2024, but

such a decision is strictly by voluntary agreement of the Elected Members. The Corporate

Services & Governance Department can arrange a Workshop in the near future for the

Elected Members of the Metropolitan District if they wish to discuss the details and

practicalities of such a proposal.

**31.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council engage***

***with the owners of empty retail units to discuss their use as pop up shops for start-up businesses***

***and or the use of their shop windows for Christmas displays.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin highlighted the number of empty retail units in the City,

and pointed out how these units could be used to support innovate start-up businesses and attract

more footfall into the City. Members supported the Motion and agreed it would be a positive

initiative for the City.

**REPLY**: Thank you for submitting the Notice of Motion regarding the engagement with owners of

empty retail units. We appreciate such a proactive approach and the utilisation of vacant

retail spaces for pop-up shops, or for start-up businesses, and the use of shop windows for

displays.

There is ongoing engagement with the owners of empty retail units and all options are

considered for reactivating the property including pop up shops. Temporary use of retail

spaces will be encouraged to transition to more long term uses where they are eligible

categories of business that qualify under the LCCC Retail and Economic Incentive Scheme

for Vacant Property adopted as part of Budget 2024. The suggestion in relation to Christmas

displays is noted and the Council will consider this as part of its continued engagement with

property owners of planning for Christmas 2024.
---
13

We recognise the importance of creating a festive atmosphere and supporting local

businesses, and we are eager to work towards achieving this goal.

**32.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that an update be***

***provided by the relevant Director regarding the progress on the acquisition of the Markets Field.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with landowners who have horses grazing on their land near the city,***

***towns and villages to inform them of the importance of preventing horses straying from their***

***land onto public property.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir, seconded by Councillor

Hartigan and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir referred to several incidences with

roaming horses in the Rhebogue and along the walkway to U.L. and highlighted the need to engage

with the landowners to prevent horses straying onto public land.

**REPLY:** The registration of equine premises is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture

Food and Marine. The Council does not have a record of private lands where horses may be

kept.

The percentage of cases where straying horses have broken out from Private lands is quite

low and is certainly less than 5%.  It is our experience that most horses straying on public

lands are deliberately placed there. Either released from neighbouring lands or indeed

raised on public lands.

The Council however will write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to ask

them to issue a notice to all registered equine premises to advise private landowners of the

importance of keeping their horses on registered land.

It was suggested that consideration be given, if possible, to the creation of a database of land where

horses are kept. Members supported the Motion and noted that this was an ongoing issue over

many years, and they requested that the Environment Section would also make a presentation on

horse control issues to the Elected Members.

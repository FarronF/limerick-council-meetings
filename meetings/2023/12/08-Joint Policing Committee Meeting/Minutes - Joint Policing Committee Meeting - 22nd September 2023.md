statistics.

The Chairman expressed concern at the increase in figures for the possession of drugs for personal use

and for sale / supply and highlighted the need to retain the Specialist Drugs Units going forward.---
In relation to the Newcastle West area, Councillor O’Donoghue queried what measures would be taken

to combat burglaries going into the Winter months. The Chief Superintendent stated that a number of

burglaries have been carried out by organised gangs in the area recently and Gardai are actively working

on this.

Deputy N. Collins referred to the National Slow Down Day and highlighted the high percentage of

motorists that were compliant and that lowering speed limits was one aspect in reducing road fatalities.

The Chief Superintendent agreed and stated the Gardai would continue to work to reduce road fatalities.

Deputy Collins asked *“How many speeding detections were recorded in the Limerick Division during t**he*

*National Slow Down Day 2023”.*

RESPONSE*:*

National Slow Down Day took place from 07:00hrs on the 21st April to 07:00hrs on the 22nd April

2023. There were 830 speed detections on National Slow Down Day – 35 of them were in Limerick

Division.

In relation to Proactive Policing Measures and the increase in drugs related searches, Councillor Bridie

Collins queried if searches were proving more positive.

The Chief Superintendent said that Members are being pro-active in relation to drugs issues and that

every effort would be made to re-build the Specialist Units in the coming months.

Councillor Sheahan (K) highlighted the issue of unemployed people who seem to have unlimited

resources and who should be investigated. The Chief Superintendent stated that the Head of CAB could

be invited to attend the next Joint Policing Committee Meeting.

Councillor Keary referred to proposed changes to the Garda roster and if additional finances were being

provided for overtime. The Chief Superintendent stated that additional finances had not been provided

**5.Question submitted by Councillor Sean Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Joint Policing Committee, what action has been taken to address***

***antisocial activity such as intimidation, use of scramblers and sulkies on the walkway from Lock Quay***

***to University of Limerick since the last JPC, including the number of patrols undertaken by Gardai.***

**RESPONSE**:

On the 31st of July Operation Croí commenced a targeted operation into use of scramblers and

associated anti-social behaviour across Limerick City. This operation includes 21 priority policing hotspots

in the City 16 or which are within Limerick City North. This operation places emphasis on CCTV monitoring

and is ongoing with no further information available for operational reasons.

This includes the walkway from Lock Quay to University of Limerick which since the last JPC meeting has

had a number of proactive patrols carried out. These patrols are subject to the availability of resources

as this area requires a beat or cycle patrol for access and intervention. No arrests in respect of scramblers

use along this area has been recorded since the last JPC.

AGS is acutely aware of the harm and intimidation around scrambler bikes in the city environs. While

recent legislation is welcome in terms of search and seizure powers we still have challenges around

pursuit and a duty of care. It is common place that the youths on the scrambler bikes are teenagers and

are not wearing helmets. No offence exists for wearing a balaclava which hinders the identification of

the persons on the bikes.

AGS has had a number of successful detections and seizures around the use of scrambler/e scooters

relating to the sale and supply of drugs which are intrinsically linked. Some of these arrests and seizures

are highlighted through media releases but we won’t comment further as some cases are sub juice and

not appropriate to comment. AGS can confirm that a number of RTC’s involving scrambler bikes have

been reported with a small number involving injuries to pedestrians. These incidents are subject to full

ongoing investigation

Road Traffic and Roads Act 2023- Legislation update will be provided at the meeting on the Friday.

6. **Question submitted by Councillor Sean Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Joint Policing Committee, how many attacks on people by dogs***

***have been reported to An Garda Siochana in Limerick for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 to date and***

***what was the response time in dealing with these attacks.***

**RESPONSE**:

This analysis is based on a keyword search of incident narratives on all incidents reports in the Limerick

Division with a date reported between 01.01.2021 and 10.09.2023. Only those incidents whose narrative

suggests any of the following occurred have been considered to be an ‘attack on the person’

-

The injured party has received a bite or injury directly from a god,

-

The injured party’s clothing has been pulled or damaged by a dog,

-

The injured party has injured themselves in an attempt to evade an attack by a dog---
In terms of response time, if that is referring to the investigative process which varies based on the

circumstances of the compliant. Offences under the Control of Dogs Act 1986 would be subject to the

statute of limitations as predominantly summary offences and require a decision on proceedings within

6 months.

7. **Question submitted by Councillor Bridie Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Joint Policing Committee, in light of a recent spate of break-ins***

***and robberies of both homes and business premises in the village of Adare can I ask what Garda service***

***is currently being provided at the Garda Station in the village. How many Garda are appointed to the***

***policing of the village of Adare and the surrounding area?***

**RESPONSE**:

Garda Resources attached to the Garda Station in Adare Village patrol the local area together with other

Gardaí allocated to the Limerick County Community Engagement Functional Area, Limerick Crime

Functional Area and the Roads Policing Unit. Checkpoints and Patrols are regularly performed with same

increased should a crime trend be identified. It should also be noted that any call for service received

from this area is dispatched through the Garda Communications Room with all available resources across

the Functional Area and Garda Division utilised when necessary.

I have not listed the resources attached to Adare Garda Station in the reply to this question as numbers

are not shared for operational reasons.

8. **Question submitted by Maurice Quinlivan, T.D.**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a progress report on operations designed to deal with the ongoing***

***scourge of scramblers and electric scooters.***

9. **Question submitted by Maurice Quinlivan, T.D.**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the progress being made in establishing the multi-***

***agency mental health de-escalation unit.***

**RESPONSE**:

This pilot project, Community Access Support Team (CAST), will be trailed in the Limerick Garda Division.

It is a partnership pilot between An Garda Síochána (AGS) and the Mental Health Services (MHS), HSE,

Mid-West Community Healthcare. It is anticipated that the Pilot will commence on the 30th November

2023. The pilot should not be referred to as a de-escalation unit.

The CAST project comprises two modes of delivery to people in crisis and/or situational trauma within

the Garda Division Geographical area. These are a Crisis Co Response and the Community Support Forum.

At the heart of the CAST pilot project is the establishment of Multi-Agency Support Forum in Limerick.

This case management forum comprises of identified statutory agencies and approved support services.

An independent person from the local authority, Limerick City and County Council, chairs the forum

which will meet on a monthly basis. The aim of the forum is to provide an integrated approach to working

with persons in crisis.

The CAST pilot project comprises of intervention, prevention and outreach with the potential to yield a

better outcome for persons experiencing mental health crisis or situational trauma. The pilot project will

also aim to reduce future presentations and interactions with Gardaí or other blue light emergency

services, through community follow-ups and the case management of complex cases.

There has been extensive engagement between An Garda Síochána, HSE, Crisis Intervention Team

members in other jurisdictions, and those with lived experience of engaging with the Gardaí at times of

mental health crisis.

AGS has finalised their recruitment for the pilot with the HSE in the process of same.

The pilot will be evaluated fully using various metrics and analysis. This evaluation will be submitted to

the Commissioner and HSE senior management after 6 months of the pilot which will inform the format

for the remaining pilot duration.

Superintendent Andrew Lacey can give a presentation at the next JPC if members are interested.

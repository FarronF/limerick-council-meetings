NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

I will move at the next Meeting that this District lobby both Minister Helen McEntee TD and
Minister Jennifer Carroll MacNeill TD to immediately make stronger and more robust
legislation available to allow for a central insurance claim register that would be meaningful
in targeting the issue of repeated bogus claims. The register should be linked with one’s
PPS number to target individuals who repeatedly or possibly make regular bogus claims in
order to profit from one's insurance.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

| will move at the next Meeting no election posters for the 2024 local elections are erected
in the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District area.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council would agree to
grant a lease on two properties in Askeaton to Askeaton Civic Trust.

1. The lands the Council purchased from Seamus Bradish at Coolranhee, Askeaton.
2. The plot of land purchased from Gerard Ruttle at Coolranhee, Askeaton.

Both of these transactions would be conditional to be used for the benefit of the local
community and in consultation with the Local Authority.

The Civic Trust will propose to have these two plots of ground as an extension to the
existing Town Park and plant them with native Irish trees which will be called a
Community Forest.

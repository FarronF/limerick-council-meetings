To consider the Draft Adare Local Area Plan 2024-2030 and the Chief Executives Report

the Draft Adare Local Area Plan 2024-2030 and decide whether or not to make or amend

the Draft Local Area Plan, in accordance with Section 20(3) of the Planning and

Development Act 2000 (as amended).

At the outset Councillor Sheahan sought clarity from the Director, Planning,

Environment and Place Making if the Public Realm Plan was still incorporated within the

Draft Local Area Plan. The Director, Planning, Environment and Place Making confirmed

that the Public Realm Plan did form part of the Local Area Plan. Councillor Sheahan

went on to say he was not comfortable with the Local Area Plan and the Public Realm

Plan being joined and asked if Members disagreed on the Local Area Plan itself what

would the outcome be of the Public Realm Plan. The Director, Planning, Environment

and Place Making advised the Public Realm Plan is a high level objective for the village of

Adare and any actions in the plan will be procured under Part 8 Planning before works

commence.

Discussion ensued and the following issues were raised by Members:

 Councillor Teskey expressed his concern that Part 8 Planning is only sought for

projects over €127,000.

 Councillor Collins stated Members were previously assured any project in the

Public Realm Plan would have to go to Part 8 Planning and nothing in the plan

would be agreed until additional parking has been identified in the village of

Adare.

 Councillor O’Donoghue advised he did not want any of the proposed works in the

Public Realm Plan actioned until the Adare Bypass is complete.

 Councillor Sheahan felt the Plan was being brought forward to facilitate the

Ryder Cup event being held in Adare.

 Councillor Keary felt there was very little in the plan to facilitate economic and

industrial development of the village of Adare and proposed all projects set out in

the Public Realm Plan would go through the Part 8 Planning process. This was

seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed.

The Director, Planning, Environment and Place Making advised Members very little

Public Realm Plan schemes would be carried out for under €127,000 and all future

schemes proposed for the village would go to Part 8 Planning and be brought before

Members as well as public consultation. He further advised the scheme was being

brought forward to facilitate economic development of the region and not to facilitate

the Ryder Cup.

Following a discussion and consideration of the Draft Adare Local Area Plan 2024-2030

and the Chief Executives Report dated 27th October 2023 on the submissions received

during the public consultation on the Draft Adare Local Area Plan 2024-2030, Councillor

Teskey proposed to make the Draft Adare Local Area Plan 2024 – 2030, subject to the

Chief Executive recommendations report dated the 27th October, subject to the

following amendments:
---
3

1. In relation to submission 96. The zoning should be retained as open space and

recreation as was previous in the Local Area Plan 2015-2021(as extended)

**Reason:** This is in the interest of retaining and protecting the existing residential

amenity of the existing estate. Further alternative suitable sites are available to

meet the core strategy requirements. This was seconded by Councillor Sheahan

and agreed.

2. In relation to submission 21. The zoning should be retained as open space and

recreation as was previous in the Local Area Plan 2015-2021(as extended)

**Reason:** This is in the interest of retaining and protecting the existing residential

amenity of existing estate. Further alternative suitable sites are available to meet

the core strategy requirements. This was seconded by Councillor Collins and

agreed.

3. I will move that Limerick City and County Council changes the zoning on lands

indicated in submission 69 to serviced sites. The lands adjacent to this site has

been zoned as serviced sites in the Draft Adare LAP, however these lands are

currently being developed and therefore should be zoned as existing housing

allowing for the serviced sites zoning to be transferred to lands as indicated in

submissions 69.

**Reason:** The reason being to reflect the development that has happened on site.

This was seconded by Councillor Collins and agreed.

4. Submission number 112 – Hutch O’ Malley Consulting Engineers/Sean O’ Brien and

Lynda O’ Mahony

That the lands in Ardshanbally Adare be rezoned from Agriculture to Existing

Residential.

**Reason:** To reflect the established boundary of the existing dwelling which

includes this area. This was seconded by Councillor Collins and agreed.

5. Submission number 56 – Marty Boylan – Ref: LCC-C244-ADAR2 – 47

I will resolve that lands in Graigue Adare should be re-zoned from Agricultural use

in the Draft Local Area Plan to Serviced Sites use.

**Reason:** There are currently insufficient serviced sites located within the Tier 4

Settlement of Adare. These sites would be available to people who reside within

the Tier 4 settlement and others and provide necessary housing units. This was

seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed.

6. Submission number 111 and 66

I move that lands identified in submission 111 zoned as Open Space and Recreation

in the Draft Adare LAP be zoned New Residential and in turn lands identified in

submission 66 zoned as Agriculture in the Draft Adare Local Area Plan be zoned

Open Space and Recreation.

**Reason:** To ensure adequate supply of appropriately located residential lands that

would lead to compact growth and to ensure no overall loss of open space and

recreation. This was seconded by Councillor Sheahan and agreed.

**QUESTION**

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will ask at the next Meeting why Bus Éireann are turning their buses in Cluain Mhuire**

**Estate in Pallaskenry.**

**Reply:**

The new NTA/Bus Eireann regional double decker buses are too large to

turn in the Village of Pallaskenry and this has meant that the bus stops

were relocated near the school which is deemed to be too far away from

the centre of the village. A new bus turning area in Cluain Mhuire Housing

Estate allows a bus to turn and also allows for the bus stop to be relocated

on the main street of Pallaskenry. The turning area was agreed with the

community council in advance of the works.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**8.**

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor B. Collins**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council changes the**

**speed zones around Chawkes Cross in Granagh to 60kms and installs driver feedback**

**signs and other necessary signage to advertise the reduction in speed at this**

**dangerous junction to improve safety for all road users.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Collins stated at a public meeting held a number of

weeks previous members of the public had advised they would welcome a simple

solution that would have dramatic effects such as improvement to sightlines at the

junction and a reduction in speed limit. Councillor O’Donoghue added there is a fear

when works begin on the Adare bypass this junction will see an increase in traffic using

this route.

**Reply:**

In order to examine an amendment to the speed limit in this area The

Speed Limit Appeals Procedure must be followed. The Speed Limit

Appeals Procedure sets out the mandatory procedure that must be

utilised by a Roads Authority or National Panel when a member of the

public or other interested party raises an objection to a specific speed

limit contained within a Local Authority’s current Special Speed Limit Bye-

laws. A speed limit appeal can be submitted to the roads department of

Limerick City and County Council for consideration. Once submitted the

appeal is processed in line with the procedure and a decision with respect

to any appeal will be made in line with The Speed Limit Guidelines.

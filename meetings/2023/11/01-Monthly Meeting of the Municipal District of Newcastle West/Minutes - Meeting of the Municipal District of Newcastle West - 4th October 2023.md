QUESTIONS

7.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for the actual rainfall level for Newcastle West town from 2.45***

***p.m., to 4.30 p.m., for the 10**th*** ***September.***

REPLY:

This information is not collected by Limerick City and County Council. I have contacted Met

Éireann and they have advised:

The closest rainfall station to Newcastle West, and for which data has already been collected

and quality controlled, is Shannon Airport, Co Clare. We can say that up just over 0.8 mm (the

day's total) fell at Shannon Airport in the hour before 17:45 UTC (4:45 pm local). However, it

appears there were thundery downpours on the day, so hourly values were likely different

from the Shannon Airport's totals.

There is a rainfall station at Castle Demesne, Newcastle West (station number 5711) which

observes daily (09-09 UTC). However, returns from this station will not be available for

another couple of months, at least. The highest *hourly* rainfall total at any of our 25 primary

weather stations *nationwide*, in the *afternoon*, was 8.0 mm at 16 UTC.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting when safety measures are likely to be put in place at the***

***junction of the Old Camas and Ballyowen roads.***

REPLY:

A low cost safety scheme will be applied for to improve the safety at this

junction. In the meantime we will carry out measures to improve the visibility

and safety at this junction.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council conduct a***

***comprehensive and immediate survey of the storm water infrastructure of Newcastle West***

***town.***

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council has engaged the services of CES Ltd, who has carried out

extensive power cleansing of the surface water network in Kilmeedy, Newcastle West and---
5

Abbeyfeale. The outcomes is to determine the condition of the pipe network, clear blockages

and supply a video survey to enable the local authority to plan future improvements.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council give a date and***

***commitment to clean Upper Maiden Street and both the North and South Quay locations***

***of Newcastle West as there is grass growing up the sides of the footpaths. We had over***

***30,000 visitors to the Castle last year and we do not want to project an image of an***

***unkempt town.***

REPLY:

Works as requested will be carried out at these locations throughout October.

NOTICES OF MOTION

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that location identifier points be placed along the Limerick***

***Greenway in the interest of health and safety.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council will review existing procedures on the

Limerick Greenway and examine possible additions that could be made.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the tragic loss of life which sadly took

place on the Limerick Greenway and to the importance of having location identifier points

along the Greenway to identify a precise location. In replying, the Director agreed to follow

up on this matter.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council provide funding for***

***our County Town’s Christmas lighting on a pro**-rata basis with Limerick City.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY:

Provision is made in the Annual Council Budget for Christmas lights supports in both the city

and county. The budget provision for Limerick City Centre reflects the benefit this has not

only for the city and county but for the Midwest region. If the budget allocation for the county

town is to be allocated on a pro-rata basis with the Limerick City allocation this is a decision

for the Members at the Annual Budget Meeting.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that funding be provided for Christmas---
6

lighting in the town of Newcastle West on a pro-rata basis with Limerick city. A discussion

followed by the Members with regard to putting a budget in place for the provision of

Christmas lighting in Newcastle West and other towns in the District and to erection and

maintenance of the Christmas lights for the festive period. In replying, the Director stated

that this is a budgetary matter and agreed to discuss same with the relevant Directorate.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Roads Section of the Municipal District of Newcastle***

***West set a specific budget aside for the supply and service of two permanent tar patchers to***

***cover specifically the road network of the Municipal District all year round.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

Currently the Municipal District of Newcastle West have two patching units operating in the

Municipal District.

It would not be deemed efficient having patching units operating all year around due to

precipitation and inclement weather. For six months of the year, two patchers are going to

be in operation throughout the district.

From November to February we will be reducing to one patching unit in the District.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan referred to the large network of roads in the

District where tar patching is to be carried out and requested that two tar patchers be put in

place in the District all year round. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer suggested that

increased General Maintenance Budget would help. He made reference to the tar patching

season which runs from March to October each year and to the costs involved in having a

patching unit in the District. He also stated that street cleaning is to be increased during the

winter months in the District.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that in the interest of balanced service of the road***

***network in the Newcastle West Municipal District that a permanent crew of road workers***

***would operate on a full time basis out of the Kinard depot in Glin.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

At present, we have two Senior Supervisor/General Services Supervisor positions operating

in the Municipal District of Newcastle West. One is located in Top Yard, Newcastle West and

one in Doonakenna. Both of these supervisors have crews operating out of these locations.

Any additions to these bases would have staffing and financial implications that would need---
7

to be approved by both Transportation Management and Human Resources. Regardless of

locations, we believe all areas in the Municipal District are getting a balanced service.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan referred to the absence of a roads crew from

the Newcastle West District operating out of Kinard roads depot and requested that a

permanent crew of road workers from the Newcastle West District operate out of Kinard

Depot to service the roads in that area. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer agreed to

liaise with the Rathkeale Roads District on this matter.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that the footpath at Ashford village be extended to the***

***speed limit at the Ballagh side.***

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council were programmed to carry out improvements to the

footpaths at the following locations in Newcastle West District in 2023; Ardagh, Athea,

Abbeyfeale, Feenagh, Kilmeedy, Mountcollins and Newcastle West. That programme is

8

Relief Road for Abbeyfeale done in conjunction with the Foynes to Limerick road (including

Adare bypass) as a matter of priority to prevent larger bottlenecks in the towns of Newcastle

working with the relevant team on this matter. He stated that an ESB presence is required

on site to get a number of street lights in working order and stated that this matter will be

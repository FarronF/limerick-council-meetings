**Policing Issues**

A/Superintendent Brennan commenced by introducing members of An Garda Síochána

present. Members commended An Garda Síochána for their work during the Covid 19

Pandemic.

The A/Superintendent proceeded to give Members an update on crime rates in the

District. He advised the biggest decrease from last year’s statistics were burglaries which
---
dropped by 90% with only one incident reported in the District. He further advised the

most significant increase was retail theft which had increased by 600% from one incident

to seven. In relation to road traffic offences drink driving was down from six cases to

three, however, there was an increase in drug driving which went from zero cases to

three. He further added there was a decrease in fraud cases which he claimed was due

to the increase of social media awareness among the public.

A/Superintendent Brennan then advised that contrary to rumours the budget for policing

operations in Rathkeale during the Christmas period had not been withdrawn. The

A/Superintendent went on to say the Christmas operation would commence at the

beginning of December and continue until mid-January and would include Drug and Road

Traffic Units as well as the Armed Response Unit. He further added that Sergeant Paul

Bentley would be leading the operation and Sergeant Bentley along with additional Gardaí

would be stationed in Rathkeale during this period. He added if members of the public

witness a crime happening they need to report same.

The A/Superintendent then referred to a fatal road traffic collision which occurred on

Halloween night in the District. All present extended their condolences to the families

involved in the fatality. The A/Superintendent advised road users to check their vehicles

are road worthy and also ensure they are not sleep deprived before driving during the

winter season.

Discussion ensued and Councillor Sheahan stated it was a mistake to close Askeaton Garda

Station and this was reflected on incidents that occurred during Halloween night in the

town. Councillor O’Brien added Gardaí on foot are a huge comfort to citizens and have a

crime deterrent effect in local communities. The A/Superintendent stated An Garda

Síochána are aware of the incidents in Askeaton referred to and advised youths took

advantage of the lack of Gardaí on the night due to members of the force having to attend

the scene of the previously mentioned fatal road traffic collision.

Councillor Collins stated it would be beneficial to meet Community Guard, Garda Claire

O’Mahony at a future Meeting to discuss local liaison with youth groups such as Foroige.

The A/Superintendent advised the Gardaí do work with other agencies and can request

Garda O’Mahony to attend a future Meeting.

Councillor Collins also added in the interest of road safety the Gardaí need to look at traffic

travelling from Limerick to Adare on the N21 as some motorists are overtaking on the

inside to turn left before the Lantern Lodge Roundabout or pulling back into traffic, which

could lead to a collision. The A/Superintendent agreed to forward this request to the

District Traffic Core Unit.
---
Councillor O’Donoghue stated there is a huge issue in some areas with members of the

public entering private lands at night with dogs. The A/Superintendent encouraged land

owners to contact 999 or their local Garda station when these incidents occur.

Councillor Teskey referred to the illegal drug pandemic in society at the present time and

encouraged a targeted approach on drug crime detection. Councillor Keary concurred

with Councillor Teskey’s sentiments adding people with low incomes are driving expensive

cars and the Criminal Assets Bureau need to take action. Detective Sergeant Reidy agreed

drug use is a scourge on society and education is key to reducing this. He added the Gardaí

are active in giving presentations in schools and also GAA Clubs. He further added the

Gardaí had investigated families in the District who were on low income and driving

expensive cards and their investigation found personal injury claims to the value of

€200,000 were used to fund these vehicles.

Councillor Collins requested an update on the use of CCTV camera footage in assisting An

Garda Síochána and also queried the legislation around the use of electric scooters.

Sergeant Cummins advised CCTV is monitored centrally for the region in Moyross and is

governed by GDPR legislation. An Garda Síochána can request and use footage of an

incident to assist in an investigation. He further added dash cam footage is also a valuable

tool in assisting with a Garda investigation. In relation to electric scooters Sergeant

Cummins advised this is an ongoing issue and he hoped to have clarification on legislation

in the near future.

The A/Superintendent concluded by informing Members they can contact the Gardaí, if

they wish to do so, by emailing LK.LimerickCounty.CE@garda.ie Monday to Friday 9.00

a.m. to 5.00 p.m. or by contacting 999 twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

Members thanked the A/Superintendent and Members of An Garda Síochána for their

attendance and contribution to the Meeting.

This concluded the Meeting.

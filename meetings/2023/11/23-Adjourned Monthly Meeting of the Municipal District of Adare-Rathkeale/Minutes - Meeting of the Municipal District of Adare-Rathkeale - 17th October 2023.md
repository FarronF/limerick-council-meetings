Following the adoption of the Minutes, Councillor Teskey expressed disappointment

that a Motion he had proposed at the September Municipal District Meeting requesting

the separation of the Adare Public Realm Plan from the Adare Local Area Plan, subject to

legal advice, was not sent. The Director, Rural, Community and Culture Development

advised the legality of this request had been checked with the Planning Department,

Limerick City and County Council and the advice received was as the process has already

commenced the Draft Adare Local Area Plan cannot be altered at this stage. However,

when considering the Chief Executive Report, the Elected Members of the Adare-

Rathkeale Municipal District will decide to make or amend the Draft Local Area Plan.

Councillor Keary asked for a response to his request at the September District Meeting

for costings for the original macadam surfacing of the carpark adjacent to the Primary

School on the N21 Rathkeale, Road, Adare. The Meetings Administrator advised she had

received a response from the A/Senior Executive Engineer, Mid West National Road

Design Office who stated the original macadam to surface the carpark cost €13,000.

Councillor Keary stated he did not accept these figures. The Senior Executive Engineer,

Roads, Traffic and Cleansing advised a private developer has received permission for a

development with an entrance through the carpark which involves a relocation and

reconfiguration of carpark.

**Road Traffic and Cleansing**

**Part 8** **–** **Proposed N69 Ballyengland Junction Improvement Scheme**

Circulated, Report of the Chief Executive dated 2nd October, 2023 setting out details in

relation to the proposed junction improvement works at the Junction of the N69 and

L6005, Ballyengland Lower, Askeaton. The report had been prepared pursuant to Section

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Enda Harrison, Executive Engineer, Roads Department to

the Meeting. The Executive Engineer, Roads Department outlined details of the report to

Members. Discussion ensued in relation to the report and the following issues were raised

by Members:

 Councillor Teskey queried maintenance of the hedgerows and grass margins when

works would be complete. The Executive Engineer, Roads Department advised

there is currently a National Roads contract which maintains all grass cutting on

the N69.

 Councillor Keary queried why consideration was not given for sightlines when

works were previously carried out on the bridge involved in this scheme. The

Executive Engineer, Roads Department advised this would have a significant

impact on the overall cost of the scheme.

 Councillors Sheahan referred to safety issues with motorists coming out onto the

N69 going towards Limerick and Councillor Keary felt the stop line was too close to

the edge of the N69 and increased land take should be considered to improve

sightlines at this location. The Executive Engineer, Roads Department advised

Consultants and Designers in consultation with Safety Engineers feel safety issues

have been addressed and added that Transport Infrastructure Ireland are in favour

of cars slowing down at junctions instead of widening junctions.---

 Councillor O’Donoghue asked if there was an alternative other than a grass verge

at the junction that would be more sustainable and easier to maintain. The

cutting at all junctions would be looked at.

The report, as circulated, was proposed by Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor

Collins and agreed.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**7.**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this committee would call on An Post to place a**

**letter box in the parish of Kilcornan.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Teskey and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheahan asked the motion be amended to include

Kildimo as the post office has closed in both villages and a post box is required.

**8.**

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor E. O’Brien**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Office of Public Works (OPW) reinstate the**

**Ballydoole road tarred and reconstructed in 2021 under a Limerick City and County**

**Council Local Improvement Scheme.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Brien, seconded by O’Donoghue and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Brien stated there was extensive damage caused

to the Ballydoole road by the OPW while they were carrying out flood relief works. He

requested the District correspond with the Minister responsible for the OPW to get a

report on the re-instatement of the road and that the item would be on the Agenda for

the November Municipal District Meeting.

**Reply:**

The roadway in question is in private ownership and as such is not in the

charge of Limerick City and County Council.

Road improvement works were delivered on this road through the Local

Improvement Scheme in 2021 by Limerick City and County Council with all

subsequent maintenance requirements on the road being the---
6

responsibility of the private landowners and not Limerick City and County

Council.

Regarding the request for the OPW to undertake works on the roadway,

this is a matter for the private road owners to liaise directly with the OPW

in order to resolve the matter.

**9.**

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor** **J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting for an update on the Foynes/Shannon Estuary public**

**water supply. This update to include a timeframe for the installation of the ultraviolet**

**reactor and an operational date.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Keary and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Donoghue stated he was disappointed with the

reply received from Uisce Éireann on this matter. Councillor Teskey proposed a Special

Meeting be convened with Uisce Éireann and Kieran Lehane, Director of Services to

update Members on the progress of works at the Foynes Shannon Estuary Water Plant.

This was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue and agreed. Discussion ensued and

Councillor Sheahan referenced the costs being incurred by the general population in the

area who have to purchase bottled water as a result of the Boil Water Notice and in

particular the elderly and those with medical conditions.

**Reply:**

Uisce Éireann is progressing with plans to install an ultraviolet reactor at

the treatment plant. This reactor will render any Cryptosporidium in the

water inactive. The projected completion date for this work is Q4, 2023.

Once these works are complete, a verification sampling programme will

be undertaken. We will then seek to lift the notice in consultation and

agreement with the Health Service Executive. Uisce Éireann’s drinking

water standards, as per EU Drinking Water regulations, are strict and

include wide safety margins.

Where risks to water quality are identified through Uisce Éireann’s

enhanced testing and monitoring programme, the Health Service

Executive (HSE) is consulted, and Boil Water Notices are issued to protect

public health.

**Water Quality Issues in Foynes**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting to discuss the Water

Quality Issues in Foynes.

At the outset of the Meeting, Councillor Teskey expressed his disappointment at the

refusal of Uisce Éireann staff to attend the Special Meeting. The A/Director, National

and Regional Shared Services advised Members that in July 2023 a Master Co-operation

Agreement came into effect seeing Uisce Éireann directing and managing all public

water and waste water supplies in Ireland. She further advised that as Uisce Éireann is a

stand alone organisation, Limerick City and County Council have no role in the day to day

running or workings of Uisce Éireann, therefore, Limerick City and County Council cannot

instruct Uisce Éireann to attend any meetings. She further advised that Limerick City

and County Council staff are under the management and direction of Uisce Éireann and

Limerick City and County Council are only responsible for the health and safety welfare

of these members of staff.

Discussion ensued in relation to the ongoing Boil Water Notice and the lack of

communication from Uisce Éireann. Councillor O’Donoghue stated that there is

confusion amongst members of the public as to who is responsible for water and waste

water as the Local Authority are still responsible for storm water and Water Service staff

use vehicles with Limerick City and County Council logo on them and added the public

need to be advised of the distinction going forward.

Councillor Keary requested a schedule of works for the Foynes Shannon Estuary

Treatment Plant for the next Municipal District Meeting stating when works are due to

commence on the installation of the UV filter and when works are expected to be

completed. He further stated that buying bottled water is putting huge expense on

people of certain categories in the locality and that a voucher system should be

introduced by Uisce Éireann to cover these costs. Councillor Teskey proposed the issue

be addressed at Full Council and should be an Agenda item for the next Full Council

Meeting. This was seconded by Councillor Keary and Agreed.

The Meetings Administrator advised she had spoken to Ciara McCaughley, Regional

Communications Specialist with Uisce Éireann who had advised a Zoom Meeting could

be arranged for Members of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District following the

November District Meeting. Members advised the Meeting Administrator they would be

willing to travel to the Uisce Éireann office in Mallow if need be to meet with Uisce

Éireann officials.

Councillor Collins stated at a previous Meeting there had been a discussion around

providing grant aid for the installation of UV filters in the homes of people in need and

requested an update on this discussion. The Meetings Administrator advised as

discussed at the May District Meeting UV filters will stop the reproduction of

cryptosporidium, however, it would not eradicate it and therefore customers would still

have to boil their water before use.

The A/Director, National and Regional Shared Services advised Members that they

should make use of the Uisce Éireann Councillor clinics to raise their issues and

concerns. She further added she would communicate all issues raised at the Meeting

with Uisce Éireann and revert in due course. She stated that there is a facility on the

Uisce Éireann website for vulnerable customers to register their details and encouraged

people to do this as if any scheme does become available this will be the point of

contact for Uisce Éireann. Councillor Collins requested the A/Director, National and

Regional Shared Services circulate an email in relation to how vulnerable people can

register their details on the Uisce Éireann website to enable Members circulate same if

they have any queries in relation to this issue.

Councillor Teskey proposed the District write to the 3 TD’s for Limerick to seek

parliamentary assistance from the Minister in relation to the timescale for when the Boil

Water Notice would be lifted. This was seconded by Councillor Collins and agreed.

Councillor Teskey further proposed Uisce Éireann be invited to attend a meeting of the

Full Council and a Motion be sent stating “Due to the number of boil water notices in

Limerick City and County a full update including a schedule of works and timeline to

alleviate the problem with a view to ending the boil water notices be provided and also

to request Uisce Éireann to attend this meeting”. This was seconded by Councillor

Collins and agreed.

---

9.

Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney

**I will ask at the next Meeting what budget has been specifically allocated to implement**

**Limerick City and County Council Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas in 2023.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council’s Traffic Calming Policy has a number of aims

which include:

(i)

To incorporate traffic calming measures at planning and design of

schemes. Limerick City and County Council will adopt a pro-active

approach by specifically addressing speed control issues at pre-

planning discussions with Developers. It will assess all planning

applications for new residential / commercial developments from a

speed control perspective.

(ii)

To respond to complaints regarding speeding issues in estates or where

accidents have occurred and assess the extent of the issue and priority

between estates.

(iii)

Subject to funding restrictions, implement traffic calming on existing

roads, on a phased basis, where need has been established.

While Limerick City and County Council does not have a budget specifically

allocated to implement traffic calming policy, the policy provides for

assessment of schemes that have a traffic calming aspect to be carried out in

a consistent manner and to be justified/approved for construction in

accordance with the policy. The policy was introduced to address the

significant number of requests for speed control measures in residential areas

and it deals with local collector roads and access roads.

Traffic Calming schemes are typically funded with other measures such as

Active Travel improvements but funding has been provided for limited speed

control measures from the Own Resources funding available.

A budget of €21m from the National Transport Authority (NTA) was allocated

to Limerick City and County for 2023. This allocation will see the delivery of a

number of schemes in urban areas which will introduce traffic calming

measures, examples are:

 Raheen to Quinn’s Cross R510 (including Ballycummin to R510 project).

 Milford Plassey Junction Improvements.

 TUS to City Centre Cycle Route.

 Dooradoyle Road Bus and Cycle Lane Improvement Works.

 Clare Street to Condell Road Cycleway (Phase 1).

 Childers Road Multi-Modal Orbital Corridor.
---
11

 Mill Road Corbally Pedestrian and Cyclist Measures.

 Ballycummin Road Pedestrian and Cycle Scheme.

 Patrickswell Village Renewal Scheme Pedestrian and Cyclist Measures.

 Low Cost Junction Tightening / Pedestrian Crossing Schemes.

 A number of Safe Routes to Schools Schemes.

In addition to the NTA allocation, Limerick City and County Council’s Own

Resources budget is used to fund traffic calming measures when deemed

appropriate by the Municipal District and when in compliance with the Traffic

Calming Policy. Such works funded from Own Resources include the following;

 Driver Feedback Signs.

 Speed Ramps.

 Junction improvement Works.

Traffic calming schemes will consist of a combination of measures and the

techniques chosen should be based on the most appropriate and effective

measures for each individual situation.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update in relation to the "Acquisition of Certain Lands**

**for National Roads Agreement" following our** **request at July’s Full Council Meeting for our**

**Director of Transportation and Mobility to engage directly with Transport Infrastructure**

**Ireland.**

**REPLY**:

Following the July 2023 Council Meeting, Limerick City and County Council

wrote to Mr. Peter Walsh, C.E.O., Transport Infrastructure Ireland, in relation

the resolution passed, namely:

‘*That, Limerick City and County Council call on Transport Infrastructure Ireland*

*(TII) to fully engage with the Irish Farmers’ Association by agreeing a new*

*‘Acquisition of Certain Lands for National Roads’ agreement between the Irish*

*Farmers’ Association representing landowners impacted by* *the forthcoming*

*Foynes to Adare motorway/dual carriageway. The agreement has expired, and*

*the lack of ongoing agreement will likely impact timely delivery of new*

*infrastructure.**’*

An email reply was received from Mr. Andrew Moore, Senior Regulatory &

Administrative Executive, on 5th September, 2023, stating the following:

*‘There is ongoing engagement between Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)*

*and the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA), at national level, in relation to*

*progressing negotiations on a possible renewal/extension of this agreement for*

*a further period.*
---
12

*The N69 Foynes to Limerick Road (including Adare By-Pass) is the first major*

*national road project to progress to land acquisition phase since the previous*

*extension of the Agreement lapsed. It is anticipated that progress can be made*

*to bring a successful conc**lusion to these negotiations in a timely manner.’*

We therefore understand that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Department of

Transport, and the Irish Farmers’ Association are engaging proactively on this

matter.

I have had a number of discussions with TII in relation to the above matter

since the July Meeting of the Council and I will continue to engage with them

in this regard.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will ask at the next Meeting what the weight allowance for the bin waiver scheme was in**

**2022 and in 2023 and, if there was a reduction in weight allowance, could the Council**

**provide a reason for this.**

**REPLY:**

The weight allowance for 2022 was 180kg per bin, i.e. 180kg General Waste,

180kg Mixed Dry Recyclables, 180kg Food Waste Recycling, a total of 540kg.

The weight allowance for 2023 was 120kg per bin, i.e. 120kg General Waste,

120kg Mixed Dry Recyclables, 120kg Food Waste Recycling, a total of 360kg.

During 2022, Limerick City and County Council tendered for the establishment

of four (4) Single Party Framework Agreements for the provision of Household

Waste Collection Services for a subsidised scheme in four (4) lots as follows:

Lot 1 - Limerick Metropolitan District; Lot 2 – Municipal District of Newcastle

West; Lot 3 - Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale; Lot 4 - Municipal District

of Cappamore-Kilmallock.

As the Council was aware that there were increases in the provisions of these

services, the tenderers were asked to submit costings for three (3) options as

follows: Option 1 - 180kg; Option 2 - 160kg; Option 3 - 120kg.

A full evaluation of all the tenders received was completed and, based on the

quality of the tenders and the available budget, Limerick City and County

Council proceeded with Option 3 – 120kg per bin.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council has had any discussions**

**with Clare County Council or if there are any plans to connect Coonagh to the Shannon**

**Greenway towards Bunratty.**
---
13

**REPLY:**

Euro Velo 1 route is the primary cycling route serving Limerick, Clare and the

West of Ireland. This route connects Limerick to Sixmilebridge, via Meelick and

the Condell Road. In addition, the National Cycling Network identifies a

supplementary cycling route connecting Limerick to Ennis. We are not aware

of any communication to date from Clare County Council in relation to this

project. We will, however, bring this to the attention of the Project

Management Office in Clare County Council.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick Fire Services can attend and support in the rescue**

**of large animals in Limerick.**

**REPLY:**

Dealing with large animals is a very specialist activity requiring expert training

and equipment. This training is not available in Ireland and Limerick Fire

Service has no staff trained in this area. In the interest of the safety, health

and welfare of Fire personnel, Limerick Fire Service does not attend or support

the rescue of large animals in Limerick.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

**I will move at the next Meeting that housing adaptation grant money be paid directly to the**

**builder/ contractor when the job is completed, the same system as in Counties Cork and**

**Kerry.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ruddle and seconded by Councillor Keary.

**REPLY:**

The Housing Adaptation Grant for Persons with a Disability, Housing Aid for

Older People and the Mobility Aid Grants are grants which are available to

private householders. The housing aid grants are works carried out to private

houses, where the householder and approved grant applicant engages directly

with the contractor. The Council administers the scheme and approves an

applicant for a grant but does not recommend or engage contractors to carry

out works to the approved applicant’s property as this is the responsibility of

the householder.

Once an applicant is approved for a grant, it is the decision of the householder

to engage a contractor to carry out the works. Applicants are advised at the

time of approval that payment of the grant will be made directly to them. If

there are future issues with workmanship or payment queries, this is between

the contractor and the applicant and Limerick City and County Council has no

liability.

Under the Revenue Guidance Notes for Government Payments, Local

Authorities are required to file an annual return of payments made in the

previous year which includes the Tax Reference details of those receiving

payment. The payments made to approved applicants for the housing aid

grants noted above would also be included in this report. Any contractor

employed directly by the Council to carry out what would be deemed

construction works is subject to Relevant Contractor Retention Tax and details

of the contract must be filed with ROS by the Council. Local Authorities are

deemed principal contractors and if the practice of paying contractors instead

of the approved housing grant applicants for works under the Housing grant

scheme, it could be deemed that the RCT system would apply.

In exceptional circumstances, we do authorise payment to contractors where

an applicant does not have a bank account. These are considered on a case-

by-case basis.

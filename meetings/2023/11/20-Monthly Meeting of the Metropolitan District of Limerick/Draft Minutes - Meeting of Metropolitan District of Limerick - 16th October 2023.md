**QUESTIONS**

**6.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the following***

***information in relation to Patrickswell Village Renewal Scheme:***

***a)**How many car parking spaces were planned for the second phase of Patrickswell Main Street***

***in the original Part 8 planning application as approved in September 2016.***

***b)**How many car parking spaces were delivered on the Main Street as part of the second phase***

***c)**What plans do Limerick City and County Council have to provide the number of car parking***

***spaces that were removed from the scheme approved by the members.***

***d)**As Patrickswell Village Renewal Scheme is now completed it must be noted a commitment***

***was given in the CE report to the members to enhance the lighting around “The Well” to date***

***this has not occurred can it be advised when this will be completed.***

***e)**The Active Travel team do not consider the moving and increasing the size of the roundabout***

***and the installation of deflection islands at the Enterprise Centre to be material please advise***

***under law the definition of material changes.***

***f)**As part of the scheme a raised junction and two raised crossings were included that were not***

***contained in the original Part 8 drawings, please advise how these were included contrary to***

***what was approved by the members.***

***g)**Provide a full list of any further variations that were made by the Active Travel Team contrary***

***to the original Part 8 application.***

**REPLY**: To answer a, b, c above, it is important to also consider the parking provision prior to the

scheme being progressed. A sheet detailing the parking available prior to the scheme, that

proposed at Preliminary Design/Statutory Approvals stage and those delivered at

construction is appended.

The sheet also provides detail on the change in number of parking spaces from the Part 8

drawings and the reason for any reduction in spaces, where applicable. It is considered that

the number of spaces provided along with the additional surfacing of the carpark adjacent

to Marian Park result in an appropriate number of spaces for the village demand with

adequate parking available within a short walking distance of the village core.

**d)** The Well is within Phase 1 of the scheme and outside the remit of the current contract

and the Active Travel / NTA funded scheme. However, Active Travel will engage with the

Operations / Placemaking Departments to ensure this commitment is acted on.---
6

**e)** There is no legal definition of material changes, it is interpreted on a case-by-case basis.

The detailed design and delivery stage of this improvement scheme recommended some

changes including the location of the roundabout within the context of the existing public

road. The changes were made within the spirit of the overall scheme, for genuine reasons

and considered necessary for the safety of all road users.

**f)** A raised crossing at the Marian Park junction was included at Part 8. A raised table has

been introduced across the junction in line with current design advice (DMURS Section

4.4.7). The raised table reduces traffic speed at a busy junction within the village core.

A pedestrian crossing point close to the Circle K shop was upgraded from an uncontrolled

crossing to a raised zebra crossing to provide a safer crossing location within the village. This

is the only controlled crossing within the village. A raised crossing was also provided at the

west of the roundabout to provide a safer crossing location for pedestrians and also to

provide traffic calming on the approach to the roundabout.

**g)** During the detailed design and constructions phases of the project, a number of

modifications were made to the Preliminary Design layouts presented at Part 8. These

included issues contained in the Part 8 responses but not reflected in the drawings such as

the increased road width from 6.0m to 6.5m and provision of disabled parking spaces etc.

In addition to these, a number of modifications were made to the design as follows:

 Reduced paving to Belgard Road – paving width was reduced to retain some green space

and extent was reduced due to condition of the existing paths.

 Provision of two bus stops and shelters within the village core were included to provide

better access to public transport.

 Additional seating, bins, bollards to prevent parking on paving and landscaped areas

and improved landscaping designs and installations were provided. More than 50 trees

are being provided for in Phase 2

Some additional elements added to the scope of the construction were installation of

permeable paving to the community centre plaza area (separate planning), extension of the

road upgrades to include access road to the graveyard, surfacing of the existing carpark at

Marian Park and adjustments to drainage and paving within previous Phase 1 area---

A bus-stop has been provided at this location and at detailed design the

There are a number of issues which resulted in amending this parking from

perpendicular parking to parallel parking. These include DMURS advice that

parallel parking should be provided on regional roads, safety implications of

perpendicular parking close to a roundabout exit, reduced width available with

road width of 6.5m retained. There is no high retail demand at this end of the

village with one house and a public house (with parking available to the rear)

immediately adjacent. The parking provided here is considered to be appropriate

to the location, adjacent usage and parking demand.

\* Note: Part 8 drawings were based on 6.0m carriageway with a commitment given in Part 8 responses that 6.5m would be provided to accommodate agricultural and commercial

vehicles.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, following the commitment***

***given by the Director of Planning, Environment and Place-Making in November 2022 to consider***

***a pilot upgrade of a lane way in the City Centre, what progress has been made to date.***

**REPLY:** Place Making Team has prepared a draft report on city centre streets and laneways. This is

currently being reviewed by LCCC Transportation and Travel Directorate. In order to access

funding, the Council is required to adhere to public spending code. When funding is

approved a pilot project can be progressed.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Report on the***

***extension of the Castleconnell Playground has been completed and is available yet.***

**REPLY**: It is proposed to extend the existing playground in Castleconnell. This project is progressing

in Q4 of this year with the appointment of a Consultant to progress the project.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***progress made to-date to provide a dog park in Castletroy Park.***

**REPLY:** An area has been identified for a dog park in Castletroy Park. A framework of contractors

has been set up to undertake works such as this. A funding source will need to be identified

before this project can proceed.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to Lynwood Park***

***Laneways, I have tried on many occasions to get Limerick Council to clean up these lanes but have***

***failed.*** ***These lanes are gated lanes but the residents who requested these lanes to be gated are***

***now deceased or elderly and cannot clean up these laneways.*** ***The laneways are now overgrown***

***and rat infested etc.*** ***Can the Council take these lanes in charge again please.*** ***There is a similar***

***lane in Granville Park that also needs to be taken in charge.*** ***We need to support our elderly***

***people who no longer can do the upkeep of these lanes.***

**REPLY:** The laneways in Lynwood Park are currently not in council charge and therefore are not in

Limerick City and County Council’s remit to maintain. Any request to take a private laneway

into council charge should be requested through the Planning department. A budget would

be required to upgrade the laneway(s) in question to the necessary standards and to also

regularly maintain when required.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can the Active Travel Team***

***and the Roads Department consider funding for Knockea National School so a safe route to school***

***can be provided to the children and parents attending the school.***---
10

**REPLY:** The Safe Routes to School Programme was launched in March 2021 and every school in

Ireland was invited to submit an expression of interest to participate in the initiative.

Knockea National School did not make an application to be part of the programme.

29 schools in Limerick applied to be part of the Safe Routes to School programme. We are

currently working with schools in Limerick who are on Round 1 and Round 2 of the

programme. Once these schools have been supported, then subsequent schools will be

brought onto the programme from the existing waitlist.

The programme is funded by the Department of Transport through the National Transport

Authority (NTA) and is supported by the Department of Education. An Taisce’s Green-

Schools is coordinating the programme. Limerick City and County Council assists on the

delivery of this programme through design and delivery of the infrastructure.

If the programme reopens for new applications in the future, the school would be eligible

to apply. In the short term we can relay the query to the local area office to determine

whether the concerns can be addressed at local level outside the formal Safe Routes to

School programme.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can the Council put in place***

***a scheme to alleviate flooding under the bridge on the R512 towards Crossagalla, because in the***

***bad weather the area becomes impassable causing traffic chaos in the area.*** ***This road is a main***

***throughfare into the City and needs to be upgraded.***

**REPLY:** Following reports of flooding on the R512 road carriageway under the existing railway

bridge adjacent to the Killmallock roundabout, Limerick City and County Council Roads

Department has completed a drainage survey of the stormwater network in the area and

recently commenced initial consultation with Irish Rail to determine a solution to this issue.

Drainage improvement costs are currently being compiled and a funding source will be

examined in due course.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how much has been spent***

***in the last five years in St. Mary's Park on contractors cleaning up illegal dumping.***

area over the period 2019 – 2023.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the local***

***authorities plans to upgrade O'Dwyer Bridge on Athlunkard Street and if a bridge restoration***

***grant has been applied for.***---
11

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council Road’s Department has recently acquired funding to

complete painting and cleaning upgrade works to O'Dwyer Bridge on Athlunkard Street. An

Appropriate Assessment screening process is currently underway which will be followed by

a tender process to appoint a suitable and competent contractor to complete the works

involved.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the Council to outline***

***their policy in relation to laneways at the rear of houses in urban housing estates to ascertain***

***whose responsibility it is to maintain these laneways.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council Road’s Department are only responsible for maintaining

laneways or roadways that are in council charge.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the breakdown of***

***consultancy services and the list of projects in Limerick City East for which consultancy was used***

***in the past 5 years in a tabular format as follows: year, consultancy services, project, amount***

***paid.***

It was agreed that a reply would be submitted for the November Meeting of the Metropolitan

District of Limerick.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council write to An Post requesting them to reinstate the post box that was removed from***

***the centre of Castleconnell*** ***Village when the Post Office was relocated.***

**REPLY**: Decisions on the location of Post Boxes are operational decisions made by An Post.

Limerick City and County Council does not have any involvement in the process where

decisions are made on where post boxes are located. However, this request can be

forwarded on to An Post for consideration.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on progress***

***for the delivery of the much-needed proposed Library for the greater Castletroy area.***

**REPLY**: A new public library requires significant planning and resources, both capital and revenue.

The first step was to include the need for a library for Castletroy in the City and County

Council’s 5-year Library strategic plan which was launched in June 2021.

Following this, we undertook a process to identify a suitable site to meet the requirements

for this rapidly expanding area of Limerick.

We have identified two potential sites in Council ownership directly behind the Castletroy

Shopping Centre and adjacent to both primary and secondary schools. The identification

of a site is a key milestone in advancing this important project.---
12

Further progress will be set in the context of available funding both Local and National,

therefore we are not in a position at this stage to have a definite timeline for delivery.

In the interim the current mobile library service in Castletroy has been extended to meet

current demand.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***removal of temporary railings around derelict sites on Parnell**Street and Hartstonge Street.***

**REPLY**: **Dangerous Structure at 10 Hartstonge Street.**

A Local Government (Sanitary Services) Section 3 notice has been served on the  alleged

Owner in November 2021. Additionally, the Derelict Sites team has issued a Derelict Sites

Section 15 notice to compulsory purchase the property. The alleged owner has appealed

this order to An Bord Pleanála. We are currently awaiting the outcome of the appeal  before

we can progress this case.

**Dangerous Structure at Parnell Street.**

Planning permission was granted for the development of this site in May 2022 and it was

expected that this would result in activity on the site and removal of the roof

structure.  Unfortunately, as there was no engagement in relation to the progression of the

development, so a further Local Government (Sanitary Services) Section 3 notice has been

issued to the owner requiring them to remove the hazardous roof by the 3rd of November

2023.  This will then allow for the removal of the fencing.  Noncompliance with the section

3 notice will result in initiation of legal proceedings.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick on the outcome of capacity***

***audit of Loughmore Canal as requested by this Council in March 2022 and for the results of this***

***capacity audit to be shared.***

**REPLY**: Flow meters at inlet and outlet to Loughmore canal and rain gauge are being installed by

Capital Water Ltd on Wednesday 11th October 2023. This will provide information for

assessment of capacity of Loughmore Canal.

**21.Question** **submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick of the protocol around***

***collecting debris and branches**from tree/hedge cutting and to ask for the debris from recent***

***hedge cutting in Raheen to be removed from footpaths and cycle lanes.***

**REPLY:** Contractors and landowners carrying out tree/hedge cutting should ensure that all debris

is removed from footpaths, cycle lanes and carriageways following works. In the Raheen

area any cutting carried out by contractors working for the Council normally takes place at

night to minimise disruption and the cleaning of debris by the contractor normally takes

place in the following days during daylight hours.

The Council’s contractor has returned to the Raheen area and has removed the debris---
13

associated with their works. The contractor will be reminded to ensure that debris is

removed promptly.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick the number and location of***

***disabled parking bays in Limerick City North.***

The Council is currently preparing to regularise the future control of car-sharing services

through the preparation of bye-laws and the formal procurement and award of a service

provider contract(s). Proposals for the designation of expanded areas for car-sharing will be

reviewed and agreed with the future service provider(s) once appointed.

As part of the on-going Electric Vehicle Charging, Civils Infrastructure: Phase I Project we

are reviewing with ESB Networks the feasibility of providing for EV car-sharing facilities at

possible city-centre and rural transport hubs such as Colbert Station in advance of procuring

a car-share service provider(s). Development of additional EV car-sharing sites may also be

carried out in conjunction with an appointed service provider(s) where feasible.

**27.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, what the budget is for the***

***Disabled Persons Grant for 2023, how much has been spent to date and if the Council could***

***comment on why applicants, who submitted applications in June 2023, are being told that they***

***will have to wait until 2024 for works “due to budget constraints for the DPG programme this***

***year”.***

**REPLY:** The Disabled Persons Grants Scheme provides grant aid to people to carry out works on

social housing stock to address the needs of older people or people with a disability.

Limerick City and County Council was awarded Grant Funding of €710,426.00 in May of 2023

for Disabled Persons Grants.

This grant funding will provide for works in 57 social housing units.

Limerick City and County Council sought an increase to the awarded grant in June -2023 of

€130,475.00 for applications that are currently on hand; this was approved in July 2023.

Limerick City and County Council has currently spent €577,199.65 of the awarded grant and

works are in progress to ensure the full grant allocation will be spend by year-end.

Limerick City and County Council is awarded a full year grant allocation based on a planned

and approved programme of works in order to plan, prioritise and implement the

programme in a planned way throughout the year.

Local Authorities can apply for additional funding from the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage for emergency cases as they arise throughout the year, and this

is considered on a case-by-case basis in respect of any new applications received

throughout the year. The ability to accommodate additional works will be dependent on

the scope and complexity of the works (and the needs of the applicant).---

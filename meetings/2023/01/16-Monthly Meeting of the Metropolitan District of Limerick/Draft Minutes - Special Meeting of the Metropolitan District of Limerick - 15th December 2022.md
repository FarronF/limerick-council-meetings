The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Elected Members, Officials, Media and Members of the Public to

the Special Meeting, which was being held to consider the Strategic Housing Development (SHD)

Application to An Bord Pleanála at Punches Cross, Limerick.

At the outset, the Cathaoirleach and Members extended their condolences and sympathy to the

family of Private Seán Rooney who died tragically on peacekeeping duty in the Lebanon. They also

wished a speedy recovery to his colleagues who were injured in the incident.

The Senior Planner then explained to the Members that the Council had received correspondence

from An Bord Pleanála that its decision in respect of the proposed Strategic Housing Development

at Punches Cross had been quashed by the High Court, and the process had been now remitted to

a particular point in the process.

She outlined that the decision was based on An Bord Pleanála’s failure to circulate the

Environmental Trust Ireland submission in a timely manner and the Court expressing the view

that it would not be permissible for the Council to abdicate to the Board a view on questions of

Environmental Impact Assessment and Appropriate Assessment for purposes of the Habitats

Directive, and noting that the Applicant had made wide-ranging submissions and the Court

envisaging a replacement report by the Council and not merely a supplemental report.

She confirmed that the High Court had ordered that the process should be reverted to the

Council’s Chief Executive’s Report phase, and had further ordered that the Council had until the
---

21st December 2022 (17 days from the date of perfection of the High Court Order) to submit an

new report.

As part of the compilation of the CE’s report, the Members are entitled to be consulted for their

views, which are incorporated into the report.  This was therefore the reason why this Special

Meeting of the Metropolitan District was being held, to seek the Member’s views on the

development taking into consideration all the submissions received.

She also confirmed that the Executive had assessed the proposal and all associated reports,

environment assessments and submissions and that the Executive considers that the proposal

accords with the objectives of the Limerick Development Plan and is mindful to support the

application.

Following a detailed consideration and discussion of the application, the Members highlighted the

following in relation to the application:

 In general the majority of Councillors were supported the development

 The site is derelict over 30years and needs the development

 Much needed development for the area in midst of housing crisis.

 Development needed to address the significant shortage of student accommodation in

limerick. Prime site in close proximity to Mary Immaculate College

 Limerick is a region of learning and infrastructure such as accommodation is critical to

ensure students can continue to come to Limerick

 3rd lane of traffic onto Rosbrien Road is to be welcomed

 Not acceptable that some students sleeping in cars or travelling significant distances on a

daily basis.

 The proposal is for compact development on a brownfield site is to be welcomed.

 The environmental reports have addressed the issues and the development and the

development it is in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development of

the area.

 Concerns raised that some objectors could not make a submission online to An Board

Pleanala. The mailbox was not big enough.

 Concerns that the development is not sub threshold and needs a supplementary

environmental assessment by the Planning Authority.

 The high court order highlighted concerns with respect to the Planning Authorities role and

its environmental assessment of the application

 The timeframe given to councillors to assess this application is insufficient

 The SHD process undermines local democracy, there is no trust in ABP and LCCC in dealing

with planning applications

 The objectors have a right to object, however a change to the planning system will be

welcome to prevent spurious objections.

The Senior Planner confirmed that a summary of the views expressed by the Members at the

Special Meeting would be incorporated into the CE Report and submitted by the deadline of the

21st December, 2022.

This concluded the Meeting.

presentation.

The Mayor opened the Meeting by stating that the Members were required to consider the

Chief Executive’s Draft Budget of Limerick City and County Council for year ending 31st

December, 2023, the Draft Budget having been served in accordance with Section 103 of the

Local Government Act, 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act, 2014.

The Mayor also stated that the 2023 budget was prepared in an environment that has seen

an escalation in energy costs and other input costs, which are critical to the delivery of local

services. New amenities, recently completed, now also require a maintenance budget while

financial supports are also needed for existing amenities all of which have witnessed
---

reductions in income and significant increases in costs. The budget is balanced despite cost

acceleration arising from existing and projected future economic growth.

In recommending the Budget to the Council for consideration, the Chief Executive stated that

2022 saw the end of the Covid pandemic, but the Russian invasion of the Ukraine in February

2022 created a new and challenging global environment. The European Union response

included offering temporary protection for those fleeing the war in Ukraine.

Ireland has since welcomed over 62,000 displaced persons from the Ukraine and Limerick has

not been found wanting providing accommodation to approximately 3,000 people to date.

Limerick City and County Council was proud to play its part in the national response including

the provision and support of accommodation for displaced persons arriving into Limerick

through the newly established Ukrainian Response Team. This Team have worked with

national agencies, accommodation providers and the Community Forum to ensure a warm

Limerick welcome is provided. Two emergency rest centres have been established in Limerick

(St. Lelia’s in Kileely and the former convent in Cappamore) and numerous private multi-

occupancy accommodation centres are supported by the team. Support is also provided to

the International Organisation for Migration who aim to match displaced persons to pledged

accommodation.

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2023 to Council, the CE

summarised the financial position of Limerick City and County Council and he confirmed that

that every effort will be made to break-even on the Revenue Account for 2022, despite

challenges faced by the Council with significant increases in energy costs and other

inflationary pressures. There is pressure on a number of income heads and ongoing controls

on expenditure are in place.

He outlined how the Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget”

based on the overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet

statutory, contractual, legal and other obligations. It incorporates the decisions made by the

Council in relation to the Local Property Tax and General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocations.

A significant challenge in the preparation of the draft Budget has been the acceleration of the

gap between the cost base and the income necessary to bridge this gap and to maintain

services at current levels. The Government, similar to the Covid period, have provided
---
3

support to mitigate some level of the impact of energy cost increases and confirmed funding

of €3m for 2023. In this context, the draft budget 2023 has been prepared on the basis of no

increases proposed to parking charges, cemetery charges, housing rents, planning fees, fire

charges or fees at the recycling Centre’s.

While there is an increase in commercial rates, the impact on small and medium enterprises

will be offset for as many as possible, with an increase in the Small and Medium Business

Enterprise Support Scheme. The commercial rate increase of 4.5% is being offset by a grant

percentage increase from 9% to 13.5%. The monies raised by the rate increase is being ring-

fenced to provide extra services, while also enhancing projects already undertaken by the

Council. These include, but are not limited to, Tourism development, additional street

cleaning and maintaining the library services. These funds allow for leveraging match funding

from the Government on projects such as the 2027 Ryder Cup and the Newcastle West

Athletics track. The proposed budget also includes the Tourism Sector Support Scheme, the

new Retail Economic Incentive Scheme, & Vacancy Refund Scheme to assist key sectors of our

economy.

The CE confirmed that under the Local Government Act, 2001 as amended, that the Draft

Budget is required to set out the expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the

Council and the income estimated to accrue to the Council. The budget is underpinned by

the Corporate Plan that supports the overall budget strategy. The latest Limerick Economic

Monitor, from earlier this year, showed that unemployment rate was down to 4.3% locally.

Vital signs at Shannon Airport, a key enabler of our economy, are returning strong. Limerick

City footfall was also on the way up. Other positive indicators are the progressing of a number

of major projects in Limerick. Building work on a number of key projects within the

transformational Opera Square project are expected to begin next year which, on completion,

will be capable of employing up to 3,000 people.

Masterplanning of the Cleeves site is almost complete for the 10-acre riverside site, while a

framework plan for the Arthur’s Quay area as part of the Urban Regeneration Development

Fund project will work on a collaborative basis and will place a renewed emphasis on public
---

realm. Significant private sector investments are also advancing, not least Kirkland

Development’s 1BQ on Bishop’s Quay set to come out of the ground over the coming months.

The International Rugby Experience on O’Connell Street is in the final stages of completion

and will attract thousands of visitors to Limerick next year. Simultaneously, the final touches

are being put to our public realm programme that will help transform O’Connell Street into

an accessible and attractive City Centre.

On the jobs front, there have been a number of positive announcements this year again, from

the likes of Johnson & Johnson, Legato, Three, Eli Lilly and Vitalograph among others. The

short-term challenge, for the winter ahead, will be challenging for many but there is a bright

light on the longer-term horizon thanks to our renewable energy opportunity, particularly

around floating offshore wind. The Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce, which expects to

report to government by year-end, will crystallise just how great this opportunity is and we

look forward to its deliberations.

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that each

Local Authority must develop a Climate Action Plan. The preparation of the Plan will

commence in early 2023 and will be completed within 12 months. The plan will also include

details for a proposed decarbonization zone. The Decarbonisation Zone will be a test bed that

will not only demonstrate what can be done and accelerate learning for other areas but also

to help understand the scale of the challenge in decarbonising the economy and wider

society. It is hoped that the climate action plan will harness and facilitate investment and

funding into the council from a range of sources including the Climate Action Fund.

Going forward across Limerick, there will be a new emphasis on connectivity and hybrid

working as we emerge from the pandemic. Infrastructure investment is not only about

helping people to move around; considerable investment is also required to reduce carbon

emissions, either by facilitating remote working through broadband investment or

decarbonising transport networks or providing funding to make homes more sustainable.

Provision in the budget is also made to progress key infrastructure projects such as the Foynes

to Limerick route, the Cork to Limerick Motorway and many others. Ongoing engagement

with The Land Development Agency to develop the public lands around Colbert Station for a
---
5

new mixed-use residential district that could accommodate up to 5,000 people and other

exciting developments are under discussion. The Limerick Greenway is Limerick’s largest

outdoor tourism amenity and was officially opened on 5th November. The multimillion-euro

Greenway has attracted almost a quarter of a million visitors since it opened to the public on

5th November.

Innovate Limerick has completed the building works on the Engine Collaboration Centre. This

Centre will seek to maximize the benefits and strengths arising from collaboration and co-

location of disruptive technology expertise to support all levels of regional technology activity

in the Mid-West. Innovate Limerick also have developed and manage engine hubs, which is a

connected network of private and public enterprise spaces across the Mid-West.

Budget 2023 will actively allow for the further engagement with and support of our

communities. It will address enhancing quality of life for our citizens by supporting new public

realm projects & programmes across the City & County in libraries, galleries, museums,

cultural and arts centres and across events. It also will continue a focus on dereliction/vacancy

and delivery of public realm improvements in our urban areas and villages that will animate

the public space and support place-making activities.

The budget looks to provide resources both staff and match funding for preparation for the

hosting of the Ryder Cup and developing legacy projects. The Ryder Cup will be the largest

global event held in Ireland this decade. The successful transfer of King John’s Castle from

Shannon Heritage to Discover Limerick DAC was an important milestone in bringing Limerick’s

iconic landmark under the control of the Council. Moving forward the DAC will seek to

develop opportunities including the redevelopment of the Adare Heritage Centre, Lough Gur

and other projects.

The budget will also help deliver on targets set out across the 4 pathways within the ‘Housing

for All’ Plan. It will enable & improve our own social housing stock and aid in tackling

homelessness and support the regeneration programme.

The repurposing of the Troy Studios loan during 2022 has allowed the Council to leverage

further national funding to agree a €20m works programme to address voids and dereliction
---

within our Social Housing Stock. The Draft Budget also includes resource increases in the

housing maintenance, traveller accommodation and housing grants areas.

Operationally, the budget will allow the organisation to meet the commitments to continue

the delivery of essential and statutory services in housing maintenance, roads, libraries, fire

services. The budget does provide additional resources to street cleaning, housing

maintenance and to our horticulture sections which have seen significant demand increases

during 2022. It will allow us to be efficient, effective and committed to providing services that

will underpin a growing and dynamic Limerick. The professionalism, commitment and

determination of staff to react to unforeseen events was again demonstrated in 2022.

The budget also makes clear the Capital Works Program for the next three years - 2023-2025,

which is included with Budget Documentation. This programme is wide-ranging over the 3

year period for a wide mix of key public projects for Limerick and is projected to cost €1.1B

which is funded from a number of sources, including own resources, national programmes

grant schemes and debt financing.

In conclusion, the Draft Budget 2023, which has benefitted from very significant feedback

from members in the Budget process, has committed to maintain and in some cases enhance

service delivery. The demand for services across Limerick continues to grow and this is

matched by an increase in public expectation. While the budget includes a proposed

commercial rate increase, I have ensured that the proposed adjustments to the SME support

scheme will protect 94% of our ratepayers against this increase.

Finally, we will continue to operate in an uncertain environment in 2023 and the continued

support of the Government to Local Authorities is critical and appreciated. The CE thanked

the Mayor and the Elected Members for their input and assistance in framing the budget. He

also thanked his colleagues in the Management team and their senior teams for their

commitment and hard work in preparing this budget. Special thanks also to all the Finance

Team for the dedicated work and support in drafting & presenting the budget too.

In conclusion, the CE recommended the Draft Budget to the Elected Members for adoption.

It was then unanimously agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Budget 2023,

as circulated to Members, would be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:

**“Introduction**

The Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December 2023 has been prepared,

circulated to Members and public notice of the Budget Meeting placed in the press, in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014.

Circular Fin 09/2022 refers to the prescribed period that applies for the holding of the 2023

Budget meeting for Local Authorities as follows; 1st November 2022 to 30th November 2022.

It was agreed by the Members at the September Council meeting to hold the statutory Annual

Budget Meeting on Friday 25th November 2022 at 10am, at Council Chamber, Dooradoyle.

Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local Government Reform

Act 2014 provides that the Budget must be adopted within a period of 14 days beginning on

the day on which the local authority budget meeting meets. The Budget therefore must be

adopted by 9th December 2022.

**Budget Process**

The budget process for the preparation, consideration and adoption of the budget requires

statutory compliance with a number of steps, which can be summarised as follows:

***Step 1 - Decision by the Council on the adjustment factor to the Local Property Tax (LPT)***

***following a public consultation process.*** This decision was made at the Council Meeting on

the 26th September to leave the LPT adjustment factor at the 2022 levels for 2023 and 2024.

***Step 2 - Allocation of the General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation (GMA).The Draft*

*Budgetary Plan was considered at the following meetings:*

Metropolitan District of Limerick

24th October

Adare / Rathkeale Municipal District

19th October

Cappamore / Kilmallock Municipal District

20th October

Newcastle West Municipal District

26th October

***Step 3 - Consultation with the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) and adoption of the Draft***

***Budget by Council.*** Initial CPG meeting held on 19th September in advance of the LPT variation

decision. Budget Strategy presented to CPG Meeting held on the 17th October with further

meeting held on the 21st November. The Statutory Budget meeting is scheduled for 25th

November with a budget workshop with Councillors to be held on the 21st November.

***Step 4 - Consideration and adoption of the schedule of Municipal works by each of the***

***Metropolitan / Municipal Districts.*** These meetings will be convened in early 2023 following

the adoption of the Budget.

***Step 5 - Consideration and adoption of the Service Delivery Plan.*** The 2023 Service Delivery

Plan will be presented to Council at the January 2023 Council meeting.

Through consultation with the Corporate Policy Group and consideration of the views of

Council as expressed through the different stages of the budgetary process, in particular as
---

expressed through the meetings of the Municipal/ Metropolitan Districts, the budget as

presented considers this feedback in a reasoned and balanced manner.

At the Statutory Budget Meeting, the Members will be asked to make the following decisions:

 Adopt the Budget with or without amendment

 Determine the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV)

 Determine the proportion of Rates Refund applicable on vacant commercial premises.

**Budget 2023 Context**

This draft Annual Budget has been prepared against the background of a number of

challenges including:

 Escalation in energy costs and other input costs which are critical to the delivery of

local services

 Negative impact of the Local Property Tax revaluation carried out in 2021

 Lack of buoyancy in Rates Income within the Valuation Base,

 Impact of negative determinations on Global Valuations appealed to the Valuation

Tribunal

 Ongoing uncertainty in relation to the valuation of Windfarms due to delay in

finalising determinations

 Lack of buoyancy across other income sources

 New amenities recently completed which now require a maintenance budget

 The need to continue to provide financial support for leisure centres and other

existing amenities, all of which have witnessed reductions in income and significant

increases in costs

 cost acceleration arising from existing and projected future economic growth,

A significant challenge in the preparation of this draft Budget has been the acceleration of the

gap between our cost base and the income necessary to bridge this gap and to maintain

services at current levels. There has been persistent upward pressure on our cost base arising

from inflation and energy costs. The Government, similar to the Covid period, have provided

support to mitigate some level of the impact of energy cost increases and confirmed funding

of €3m for 2023.

Against this trend of increasing costs, the income base of the Council has largely remained

static and in some cases, the Council has seen reductions with income levels not returning to

pre covid levels. The income from our commercial rates base has been reducing due to the

contraction of our rates base associated with some business closures and reductions from

appeals and revisions. It is not sustainable for any business including the Council to maintain

pricing at consistent levels over a prolonged period while both costs and demands on

expenditure are increasing.

Demands for additional funding are also increasing. The Housing Capital Programme

continues to increase in line with our targets set out in the ‘Housing for All’ plan. The

repurposing of the Troy Studios loan during 2022 has allowed the Council to leverage further
---
9

national funding to agree a €20m works programme to address voids and dereliction within

our Social Housing Stock. The Draft Budget also includes resource increases in the housing

maintenance, traveller accommodation and housing grants areas.

The Council is pursuing an ambitious capital programme, which is maximising investment into

the City and County from a range of national programmes including URDF, RRDF, Outdoor

Recreation Scheme, Town and Village Renewal etc. All of these projects require co-funding

from the Council.

This recurring investment along with demands in other areas such as the provision of new

amenity facilities and public lighting upgrades will have to be funded by loans raised and

financed through the revenue budget placing further pressures on our income base.

The financial demands on the Council`s revenue budget necessitated by the combined factors

of cost increases, matched funding required to support projects and additional investments

can only be sustained through realistic income increases from across all major income

sources.

In this context, the draft budget 2023 has included a 4.5% increase in Commercial Rates.

However, in order to shield the SME sector from this increase, the budget reflects an

enhanced SME scheme providing a rebate of 13.5% of their warrant subject to a limit of

€1,500. The monies from the increase will be ring-fenced to maintain and in some cases

increase the delivery of local services.

**National Economic Outlook**

The National Budget 2023 was framed against the backdrop of an economy that is broadly

operating at full employment, but where near-term prospects have deteriorated significantly.

The weaponisation of Russian natural gas supplies has triggered an exceptionally large energy

price shock and undermined global economic prospects. While Ireland does not source

natural gas directly from Russia, end-users pay global prices with wholesale gas prices trading

around 8 times above normal levels at times during September. As a result, domestic

inflationary pressures have intensified, further eroding the purchasing power of Irish

household incomes and businesses including local authorities.

For this year, inflation is projected by the Department of Finance to average 8.5 per cent, with

the rate peaking at 10.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, with a similar rate in the first quarter

next year. An average inflation rate of just over 7 per cent is anticipated for next year as a

whole.

Stagflationary pressures (weaker growth alongside higher inflation) are also building, with the

Irish economy now subject to its third supply-side shock since the turn of the decade. Against

this very difficult background, and alongside a deterioration in sentiment and rising borrowing

costs, the Department of Finance’s projection for domestic economic growth in 2023 has

been downgraded significantly. Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) – a measure of the

domestic economy - is now expected to increase by just 1.2 per cent next year, a 2.7
---
10

percentage point reduction relative to the spring forecasts. Consumer spending, the largest

component of MDD, is expected to decline in the second half of this year and recover

gradually from the middle of next year with growth of 1.8 per cent projected for next year.

The rapid rebound in the labour market is undoubtedly the most positive post-pandemic

economic development. The employment level reached 2.55 million in the second quarter,

its highest ever. For next year, employment growth is expected to remain relatively subdued,

in keeping with the general economic outlook. An unemployment rate of just over 5 per cent

is projected for next year.

A general government surplus of €1 billion (0.4 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI)) is

projected for this year. For next year, the general government surplus is projected at €6.2

billion (2.2 per cent of GNI\*). However, stripping out the Department of Finance’s estimate

of ‘windfall’ corporate tax receipts, a deficit of €8 billion would be recorded this year and €3.8

billion next year.

Public indebtedness next year is projected at €224 billion; pre-pandemic this figure was closer

to €204 billion. An ageing population will involve significant fiscal costs by the end of this

decade, changes in the population structure will necessitate an additional €8 billion public

expenditure each year simply to maintain existing levels of service.

**Local Outlook:**

The global energy crisis looms like a dark cloud, not just for us but many others, not least our

EU partners. The short-term challenge, for the winter ahead, will be challenging for many but

there is a bright light on the longer-term horizon thanks to our renewable energy opportunity,

particularly around floating offshore wind. This is an all-Ireland opportunity but will inevitably

have the Shannon Estuary as its hub because of its proximity to the wind resource and its

deep and sheltered waters, which are almost unrivalled in a European context and essential

for realising this unique national opportunity for Ireland to become a major international

energy player. Better still that we will be a green energy player and creating tens of thousands

of jobs here in the wider Limerick region as a result. The Shannon Estuary Economic

Taskforce, which expects to report to government by year end, will crystallise just how great

this opportunity is and we look forward to its deliberations.

Our latest Limerick Economic Monitor, from earlier this year, showed that unemployment

rate was down to 4.3% locally. Vital signs at Shannon Airport, a key enabler of our economy,

are returning strong. Limerick City footfall was also on the way up. Another key vital sign,

housing, was also going the right direction if, admittedly, at a pace we would like to increase.

Completed housing units are also strengthening, as are the number of planning applications.

Other positive indicators are the progressing of a number of major projects in Limerick.

Building work on a number of key projects within the transformational Opera Square project

are expected to begin next year which, on completion, will be capable of employing up to

3,000 people. The redevelopment of the Opera Square site is a strategic regional investment,

essential for the economic regeneration of Limerick City. These will not alone be

transformational projects for Limerick but the build programme alone will be a huge

economic stimulus for Limerick.

Masterplanning of Cleeves is almost complete for the 10 acre riverside site, while a

framework plan for the Arthur’s Quay area as part of the Urban Regeneration Development

Fund project will work on a collaborative basis and will place a renewed emphasis on public

realm.

Significant private sector investments are also advancing, not least Kirkland Development’s

1BQ on Bishop’s Quay set to come out of the ground over the coming months. The

International Rugby Experience on O’Connell Street is in the final stages of completion and

will attract thousands of visitors to Limerick next year. Simultaneously, the final touches are

being put to our public realm programme that will help transform O’Connell Street into an

accessible and attractive City Centre.

On the jobs front, there have been a number of positive announcements this year again, from

the likes of Johnson & Johnson, Legato, Three, Eli Lilly and Vitalograph among others.
---
12

There is a renewed focus in towns and village with programmes to tackle vacancy and

dereliction to help renew and reinvigorate towns across Limerick.

Further developments along the Limerick Greenway will allow locations to realise its full

potential.

There are areas we will also be looking to make significant gains in during 2023, not least the

residential market. Our affordability and quality of life ensures we have an exciting and

attractive mix for people to live work and play here. The recent announcement of the

Residential Zoned Land Tax by the government is designed to stimulate the development of

more housing across Limerick.

**Budget Strategy & Objectives**

**Outturn 2022**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2023 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

The Annual Financial Statement of Limerick City and County Council for the year 2021 shows

the accumulated balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit position of €907,878. I have

reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to break-

even on the Revenue Account for 2022 despite challenges faced by the Council; however

there is pressure on a number of income heads and ongoing controls on expenditure are in

place. In particular, I am concerned with the significant increase in energy costs and other

inflationary pressures, which are affecting not only our own services but also those of our

subsidiary companies such as leisure facilities. The 2023 draft Budget reflects the need to

continue a strong financial management ethos while making every effort to meet the ever-

increasing demands on the services of Limerick City and County Council.

**Analysis of Expenditure Requirements 2023**

The total estimated expenditure included in the Draft Budget for 2023 amounts to €905.62

million, a decrease of €46.61 million on the adopted figure for 2022. The reduced activity in

the HAP Shared Service Center accounts for the majority of this decrease. As this expenditure

is matched by a corresponding income, it has no net effect on the Budgetary Provisions. The

following Table 2 depicts Revenue expenditure by Division.

**Grants and Subsidies Income**

Grants and Subsidies income excluding HAP income for Draft Budget 2023 is €90.3m and is

noted in Table E. Some of the key income sources under this heading include:

 Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of social

housing by providing financial support to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies

for the leasing of houses and apartments. Such long term leasing is noted at €10m for

2023 compared to €2m in 2022 (increase of €8m).

 Road Grants are assumed to remain at 2022 levels.

 Compensation for increases in rates of pay and PSPR resulting from the unwinding of

FEMPI legislation and increases in pay and pensions relating to the Public Sector Stability

Agreement and most recent pay talks dealing with inflationary issues is noted at €11.63m

in Draft Budget 2023 (increase of €5.19m compared to 2022 due to pay increases in 2022/

2023).

**Local Property Tax Allocation 2023**

Local Property Tax (LPT) is now a key funding source for Local Government replacing the

General Purpose Grant funding allocation. The initial allocation under this funding heading

was confirmed as €17,554,464. In line with the commitment in the Programme for

Government – “Our Shared Future”; the allocation mechanism for LPT was changed in 2023

to allow for 100% of the estimated yield to be retained locally within the local authority area

where it is collected. Previously the methodology for equalisation was 80% of the estimated

LPT yield before variation is retained locally and 20% is used to provide equalisation funding

to those local authorities with lower property tax bases. Under the new model for 2023, all

equalisation funding will be met by the Exchequer to ensure that all authorities receive, at a

minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline.

The Local Property Tax (Local Adjustment Factor) Regulations 2022 do not refer to yearly

decisions but instead to “a period as specified in the resolution”, meaning elected members

can now set a local adjustment factor for a period of their choosing. The Local Government

Reform Act 2014 and associated Regulations permits the Members of the Council to vary the

Rate by a maximum increase or decrease of 15%. The Council decided to adjust the LPT rate

upwards by 15% for 2023 and 2024 equating to an increase of €2,136,615 (compared to

increase of €2,398,043 in 2022 – reduction of €261,428). As a result of the 2021 property

revaluation for LPT assessment, the level of LPT collected in Limerick area reduced by Euro

1.7m. It is significant that over 50% of properties now fall into the 1st valuation category with

a base value for Local Property Tax of €90.

The 2023 allocation from the Local Property Tax and the calculation provided by the DHPLG

on the basis of this allocation is set out in ***Table 4*** below:

**Table 5: Allocation of additional resources**

**Commercial Rates**

Commercial Rates is a significant contributor to the total budgeted income for the Council

and it is vital to the level of service delivery that income from this source is maximised. In this

respect it is critically important that the Valuation Office reverts promptly with new valuations

during 2023. Limerick City and County Council will continue to ensure that all commercial

properties in the City and County are included on the rates records and are properly rated.

This financial loss in Commercial Rates for 2023 due to the windfarms’ appeals and reduction

in the global valuations of some utilities, has been part mitigated by the Council receiving

some Rates buoyancy in Commercial Rates.

Draft Budget 2023 is presented based on a commercial rate increase of 4.5%, with proposed

amendments to the Small and Medium Business Support Scheme to help mitigate the

increase for the businesses included in this scheme.

The increase in Commercial Rates has been allocated to provide additional resources for the

delivery of the following services / schemes:

**Vacant Property Scheme 2023**

Section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives the power to the members of local

authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas

within the overall administrative area of the local authority.

Article 29 of the Local Government (Financial & Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provides

that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be decided at the statutory annual budget

meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area

shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The budget has been

framed on the basis the refund rates on vacant property noted in Table 6 below.

The following amended vacant property scheme is proposed for 2023:

**Band**

**% Refund**

Up to €11,888 Annual Rate Demand (with payment of

50% required)

50%

€11,889 to €59,590 Annual Rate Demand (with

Over €59,591 Annual Rate Demand (with payment of

90% required)

10%

**Table 7: Proposed Vacant Property Scheme 2023**

**Small and Medium Business Support Scheme 2023 (SME Scheme)**

The proposed Small and Medium Business Support scheme will pay a financial support to

occupiers of commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €30,000 but not less than €1 in 2023. The proposed % support for 2023 rates is

13.5% subject to a maximum refund of €1,500 which will be subject to a number of terms and

conditions, including 25% of arrears must be paid in year 1 to qualify for the scheme with a

payment plan in place over years 2 to 4 for the remaining arrears.

**Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2023**

The Proposed Tourism Sector Support Scheme for 2022 will be a financial support/reduction

to occupiers of commercial properties directly linked to the Tourism Sector. In order to

qualify, the total annual Commercial Rates liability must be in excess of €30,000 (Businesses

with a Rate Demand less than €30,000 already qualify for the SME Scheme 2023) and is

subject to a number of terms and conditions. The support grant payment which is aimed

specifically at the Tourism and Hospitality Sector will be set at 4% of the total Rates, including

arrears, up to a maximum grant payment of €1,500, for 2023 subject to the Scheme being

approved by the Council.

**Retail Economic Incentive Scheme**

The Business & Retail Incentive Scheme has been replaced for Budget 2023 with the Retail

Economic Incentive Scheme. The Retail Economic Incentive Scheme offers an incentive to

retailers to encourage and develop certain retail uses in our city and town centres. The new

scheme is designed to combat increasing vacancy in the core retail area of Limerick City

Centre and our main towns. The Council continues to work with Retail Excellence Ireland,

Retail Ireland, and Limerick Chamber of Commerce and other local stakeholders in developing

a vibrant City Centre.

**Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Transactional Shared Service Centre**

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is the principal platform for underpinning the

provision of housing support in Ireland and has been in operation for a number of years. HAP

is a form of social housing support provided by all Local Authorities under the Housing

(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. The availability of HAP enables all Local Authorities to

provide housing support to over 59,000 households with a long-term housing need, including

many long-term Rent Supplement recipients.

The key business processes delivered on behalf of the Local Authorities by the HAPSSC are

Tenancy Processing, Weekly Tenant Rent Run, Monthly Landlord Payment, Tenancy

Amendments, Debt Management, and Recoupment Management. The cost of running the

national centre is fully recouped by Government.
---
23

The HAPSSC will administer circa 8,500 new tenancies in 2023 and process in excess of €650

million in payments to HAP landlords and collect €150 million in differential rent from HAP

tenants.

**Ukrainian Response**

The 24th February 2022 saw the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, and the European Union

response included offering temporary protection for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Ireland

has since welcomed over 62,000 displaced persons from the Ukraine and Limerick has not

been found wanting providing accommodation to approximately 3,000 people to date.

The humanitarian response in Limerick includes the provision and/ or support of

accommodation for displaced persons arriving into Limerick through the newly established

Ukrainian Response Team. This Team (funded by the Department of Children, Equality,

Disability, Integration and Youth) will work with national agencies, accommodation providers

and the Community Forum to ensure a warm Limerick welcome is provided.

Two emergency rest centres have been established in Limerick (St. Lelia’s in Kileely and the

former convent in Cappamore) and numerous private multi-occupancy accommodation

centres are supported by the team. Support is also provided to the International Organisation

for Migration who aim to match displaced persons to pledged accommodation.

**Climate Action**

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that each

Local Authority must develop a Climate Action Plan. The preparation of the Plan will

commence in early 2023 and will be completed within 12 months. The plan will also include

details for a proposed decarbonization zone. The Decarbonisation Zone will be a test bed that

will not only demonstrate what can be done and accelerate learning for other areas but also

to help understand the scale of the challenge in decarbonising the economy and wider

society. Preparatory work has commenced on the plan with the procurement of baseline

studies to inform the plan preparation. It is hoped that the climate action plan will harness

and facilitate investment and funding into the council from a range of sources including the

Climate Action Fund.

**Limerick Greenway**

The Limerick Greenway is Limerick’s largest outdoor tourism amenity and has attracted more

than 800,000 visitors since it reopened to the public on 1st July 2021. The 40km greenway,

which connects the towns and villages of Rathkeale, Newcastle West, Ardagh, Templeglantine

and Abbeyfeale. The data shows that over 70% were cyclists and there has been

overwhelmingly positive feedback from local hospitality businesses across the region. The

investment in the Limerick Greenway has provided a strategic piece of sustainable travel

infrastructure and a tourism amenity, which will support local community development

socially, culturally and economically. The local authority led the project with the support of
---
24

the Department for Rural and Community Development, the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage, the Department of Transport and Fáilte Ireland.

**General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation 2023**

Circular Fin 08/2015 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)

(Amendment) Regulations (S.I.363 of 2015), which amends the Local Government (Financial

and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 by providing that the meeting at which Municipal/

Metropolitan members consider the draft budgetary plan must conclude no later than 10

days prior to the local authority budget meeting.

Following the adoption of the budget a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and

repairs to be carried out during 2023 in each Municipal/ Metropolitan District will be prepared

for consideration and adoption by the Municipal/ Metropolitan District Members. The draft

budget has included a general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocation of €1.463m in total for

district members, which will provide a focus and clarity as regards how the elected members

want to account for the expending of monies within their area.

**Workforce**

Recruitment of staff within the Organisation will continue with ongoing focus on the

replacement of staff following retirements, promotions and departures. There will also be

continued emphasis on filling specific purpose posts funded for fixed term periods.

As a major employer in the region, it is important that we provide employment opportunities

to the communities we serve. The Graph below shows our overall numbers at present and

the number of retired staff.

Blended working in the local government sector reflects the implementation of government

policy that public sector employees move to 20% remote working. Following the issue of a

Local Government Blended Working Framework, Policy, and FAQ, Limerick City and County

Council approved a Policy for Blended Working based on the national framework. Blended

Working was introduced in Limerick City and County Council on 25th July, 2022.

**Water Services/ Irish Water**

The Water Services budget now largely covers the payroll costs for 139 full time staff

equivalents and central management charges that will be recouped from Irish Water.

Materials, equipment, services, plant hire and energy are now primarily purchased through

the Irish Water procurement system and, therefore, no longer appears on the Council’s

expenditure system.

**Directly Elected Mayor:**

On 14 September 2022, Government Chief Whip Jack Chambers published the legislative

programme for the forthcoming Oireachtas sessions noting priority legislation for Drafting

and Publication, and within the list is the “Local Government (Directly Elected Mayor with

Executive Functions in Limerick City and Council Bill”. It is noted that the “heads of the Bill”

have been approved on 20th April 2021 and the pre-legislative scrutiny has taken place. No

budgetary provision has been made in the 2023 budget for a Directly Elected Mayor on the

basis that the report recommended that any additional mandate must also have additional

means to deliver.

**Capital Budget 2023-2025**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, please find attached a report on the programme of capital

projects proposed by Limerick City and County Council for the 3 years 2023 to 2025.

A key element of the Capital Programme over the coming years is delivering on the Limerick

2030 plan. Council members agreed to the raising of a working capital loan in 2014 of €32m

and in 2017 approved loans of €170m from the European Investment Bank and Council of

Europe Development Bank to help fund this programme. In 2020, with the commencement

of the Opera Project, the Council requested and received the first drawdown of €25m from

the EIB. Also, The Rural Regeneration & Development Fund (RRDF) and the Urban

Regeneration & Development Fund (URDF) will provide funding opportunities for the Council

to develop strategic projects.

Given the fact that we are proposing allocations over 3 years, it would be unrealistic to

suggest that these allocations are definitive and are subject to funding being available in

future years. Capital projects by their very nature are flexible rolling plans which involve an

annual review and possible adjustment. Below please find a summary of potential spend and

source of funding for the 3 year capital plan 2023 to 2025.

**Conclusion**

The overall objective of the budget preparation for 2023 has been again to maintain existing

services to a high standard and ensure that Limerick City and County Council fulfils its

statutory and regulatory obligations in an environment of increased costs and limited funding.

The demand for services across Limerick continues to grow and this is matched by an increase

in public expectation.

It has been necessary to increase the Commercial Rates but in parallel, I am recommending

an enhanced SME scheme that will shield ratepayers under €30,000 from the increase. In

fact, 94% of ratepayers can avail of this scheme and therefore will not have to pay an increase.

The additional monies are required to meet the increased demands of providing existing and

new services.

In balancing the budget, I have taken into consideration members’ feedback particularly in

relation to increased maintenance demands on our social housing stock, the level of match

funding for housing grants, continued investment in our road infrastructure, and demands on

our horticulture section with new and existing amenities to be maintained.

The budget also looks to provide match funding for tourism development including the

hosting of major events, which will allow the Council to leverage national funding. The

successful transfer of King John’s Castle from Shannon Heritage to Discover Limerick DAC a

wholly owned subsidiary of the Council in 2022 was an important milestone in bringing

Limerick’s iconic landmark under the control of the Council. Moving forward the DAC will

seek to develop other opportunities including the redevelopment of the Adare Heritage

Centre in advance of hosting the Ryder Cup in 2027.

During 2022, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events such as the humanitarian

response for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, increased inflationary pressures arising from

the invasion of Ukraine and related uncertainty on energy costs, which demonstrated the

professionalism, commitment and determination of staff to manage the impact of these

events.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and the Elected Members for their

assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy Group in preparing

this budget.

I also wish to express my appreciation to the Management Team and their own teams for

their commitment and hard work in preparing this document. The coming year will again be

challenging, but it will offer significant opportunities.

I look forward to the full support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to be held

Friday 25th November 2022.”

The Deputy Chief Executive then provided an overview of the Budget including an overview

of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the corresponding Capital programmes.

Following the Deputy Chief Executives overview of the Budget, the Mayor confirmed that this

concluded the review of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the Members would be

afforded the opportunity for questions and answers in relation to each division. He then asked

for a Proposer for the draft Budget, as presented.

**Councillor Sheahan (J)**

Councillor Sheahan (J), speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Group, thanked the Chief Executive

and the Deputy Chief Executive and their team for the work that had gone in to the

preparation of the Budget and also thanked the Executive of the Council for their work on

behalf of the people of Limerick.

He referred to the fact that the Budget was being framed against a background of 8.5%

inflation and current energy inflation of 300%, due primarily to the war in Ukraine and the

illegal actions of Russia. He welcomed the Governments proposed energy support measure

of €3m for the local authority, which was vitally needed. He also noted rising pension costs

for the local authority and the need to consider an alternative system of financing it. He also

stressed the importance of the timely completion of works on O’Connell Street to eliminate

disruption to business and allow businesses get fully back to trading.

While he noted the proposed increase in commercial rates, the impact on small and medium

enterprises will be offset for many businesses with an increase in the Small and Medium

Business Enterprise Support Scheme. This is because the proposed commercial rate increase

of 4.5% is being offset by a grant percentage increase from 9% to 13.5%. He also noted that

the monies raised by the rate increase is being ring-fenced to provide extra services, while

also enhancing projects already undertaken by the Council. These include, but are not limited

to, tourism development, additional street cleaning and maintaining the library services. This

additional funding will also allow for leveraging match funding from the Government on

projects such as the 2027 Ryder Cup and the Newcastle West Athletics track.

He stated that the proposed budget would protect the Council’s service delivery to the

people. He welcomed the proposed increase in housing maintenance and housing grants but

noted that it was harder and more expensive to get contractors to do works. He also

welcomed the intention to maintain resources in the area of Estate Management and Tenancy

Enforcement

He welcomed the proposals on Local Property Tax, which would facilitate the ongoing

investment in local projects and schemes under the General Municipal Allocation (GMA)

scheme. He noted the importance of housing delivery in the county in the years ahead and

he stressed the importance of providing a supply of additional housing in the county to

support those in need of social or affordable housing. This was also dependent on the

provision of adequate basic infrastructure such as water and sewage, which was vital for the

provision of housing to meet the demand at the current time.

On behalf of the Fine Gael Group, he formally proposed the Draft Budget for 2023.

**Councillor** **O’Hanlon**

Councillor O’Hanlon, speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fail Group, welcomed the Budget and

thanked the Chief Executive, the Deputy Chief Executive, and their team for the work that had

gone in to the preparation of the Budget. He outlined how the revenue budget was prepared

amidst the backdrop of an accelerating gap between the cost base and the income necessary

to maintain services at current levels. Despite these budgetary challenges created by the

current global environment, the newly adopted budget provides for the continuation of all

Council services for 2023. He also noted that the proposed increase in commercial rates

would be offset for many with an increase in the Small and Medium Business Enterprise

Support Scheme.

He emphasised the importance of continuing to make Limerick an attractive place for people

to come and live, visit and enjoy all the amenities in the city and county. He stressed the

importance of welcoming all those displaced by the war in Ukraine and condemned the

actions of Russia, which has had such an impact on not only the people of Ukraine, but across

all of Europe as well.

for 2023.

**Councillor Benson**

Councillor Benson, on behalf of the Sinn Féin Party, stated that as a result of the illegal

invasion of Ukraine and subsequent energy and price increases, that this had been a very

challenging year for everybody. She praised the staff for their commitment under very

difficult circumstances. She thanked the Deputy Chief Executive and his Finance team for

their hard work and assistance during the Budget process.

She welcomed the provision of additional resources allocated for housing maintenance, and

the retention of the Bin Waiver Scheme. She referred to the serious housing crisis ongoing at

the current time and the need for the Government to do more to address this. She also

criticised the fact that €1.7m in vacant site levy’s had not been collected and said that this

should be prioritised. She also stated that housing grant funding should be increased and that

the Sinn Féin team on the Council would vote for the budget if the funding of €30k proposed

for the Tourism Support Scheme would instead be redirected to housing grants, namely

Disabled Persons Grants instead.

**Councillor Secas**

Councillor Secas, on behalf of the Labour Party acknowledged the work done in the

preparation of the budget and thanked the Deputy Chief Executive and his team for their

commitment and availability during the Budget process. She welcomed the provisions

contained in the Budget and the importance of the continued delivery of a wide range of

services across the City and County.

She noted that the country was in a cost of living and energy crisis and had concerns regarding

the proposed rate increase but welcomed the business supports that were being put in place

for the vast majority of ratepayers and she emphasised the importance of continued support

for the business community. She noted that there are no increases proposed to parking

charges, cemetery charges, housing rents, planning fees, fire charges or fees at the recycling

centres.

She welcomed proposals in relation to housing including housing maintenance, the housing

capital programme and the importance of providing much needed additional housing supply,

which was so important at the current time for many people. She welcomed the proposals on

Local Property Tax, which would facilitate the ongoing investment in local projects and

schemes under the General Municipal Allocation (GMA) scheme, and she noted the various

initiatives in relation to tourism promotion across both the city and county.

She confirmed that the Labour Party would be supporting the budget.

He emphasised the importance of increased expenditure on social and affordable housing

provision and emphasised that the provision of new social and affordable housing is urgently

required. He welcomed the proposed expenditure on Active Travel measures across the city

and county. He agreed that people displaced by the Russian invasion of the Ukraine should

be welcomed and supported as much as possible during this difficult time for them.

**Councillor Teefy**

On behalf of the Independent Group, Councillor Teefy thanked the Deputy Chief Executive,

his team and all involved for the work they have done in presenting a balanced budget under

difficult circumstances and for their availability at all times during the Budget process.

She welcomed the investment in housing and building and the increased provision for housing

maintenance, and the increase for Housing Adaption Grants,but expressed concerns about

increased building costs and the impact that this would have in securing contractors to carry

out works**.** She thanked management and all the staff, both indoor and outdoor, for their

continued work and commitment.

Councillor Teefy also welcomed the continued capital investment in roads infrastructure and

welcomed the schemes being delivered by Active Travel in Limerick city and county, which

would improve connectivity for people. She also referred to the resources made available

from the Local Property Tax, which has allowed additional investment in roads/footpaths.

She noted the fact that business supports would assist the vast majority of ratepayers, despite

the proposed increase in commercial rates for 2023 and stressed the importance of

continuing to support businesses during these uncertain times, which are so important for

the businesses impacted.

She confirmed that the Independent Group would be supporting the budget.

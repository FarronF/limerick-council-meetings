The Mayor welcomed everybody to the Special Meeting, explaining that it was being held in

order to pass a Vote of Sympathy for former Member and former Cathaoirleach of Limerick

County Council, Mr. Michael Collins, who had sadly passed away. Deep sympathy was

expressed to his wife Una, daughters Michelle and Deirdre, son James, and to his extended

family, friends and neighbours, on their loss.

The Mayor went on to state that the Collins name was synonymous with Limerick politics, and

noted that Michael was involved in politics for many years. Michael served as Cathaoirleach

of Limerick County Council in 1985. The Mayor expressed sympathy to his son James Collins,

a colleague and current Member of Limerick City and County Council, and commended him

for being present in the Chamber for the Special Meeting.

Michael was first elected as a TD for Limerick West in 1997, a seat he held until he retired in

2007. The Mayor confirmed that the Collins family held that seat in Dail Eireann since 1948,

and noted that Michael took the seat previously held by his brother, Gerry, and his late father,

James, before that. Michael was a very warm, generous, humble man who dedicated his time

to the people of Limerick. He was committed to serve Limerick, and did so with great pride.

The Mayor recalled his very successful political career and described him as an extremely

engaging and encouraging person.

Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. They commended their

colleague, Cllr James Collins, Michael’s son, for being in the chamber at the Special Meeting

and stated his father would be extremely proud of that. They acknowledged that Michael

played a huge part in politics in Limerick for many years, and noted that he served Limerick

extremely well, both at a local level and nationally. They remembered Michael as a

gentleman, and a man with huge integrity.

Outside of politics, they remembered Michael as a successful businessman and referred to

his time as a hotelier at the Railway Hotel on Parnell Street in Limerick City. This hotel was in

his ownership for 46 years. Michael also served as Foynes Harbour Commissioners and as a

member of the Mid-Western Health Board. The Members expressed their sympathies to his

wife Una, daughters Michelle and Deirdre, and his son Councillor James Collins. They stated

he would be missed by the people of Limerick, who he represented for many years.

The Chief Executive, on behalf of Management and staff, paid tribute to Michael Collins and

expressed his condolences to Michael’s family and friends, on their loss, and in particular to

his son Councillor James Collins. The Chief Executive commended James for being in the

Chamber at this Special Meeting as a mark of respect to his father. He continued by

remembering Michael as a formidable and very well respected politician in Limerick. He

noted that Limerick is a better place for the mark he made in politics. Our thoughts and

prayers go out to his family today on their sad loss.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Deputy Mayor held a minute's silence and reflection as

a mark of respect.

Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

This concluded the Meeting.

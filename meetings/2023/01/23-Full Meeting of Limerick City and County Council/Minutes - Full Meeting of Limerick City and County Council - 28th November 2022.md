housing supply and to ensure regeneration of vacant and idle lands in urban

locations. The timelines are set out in the Finance Act, 2021, and Residential

commencement periods.

The Guidelines also set out that ‘*the local authority does not need to establish*

The Local Authority is obliged to comply with the Finance Act, 2021, and

associated Guidelines.

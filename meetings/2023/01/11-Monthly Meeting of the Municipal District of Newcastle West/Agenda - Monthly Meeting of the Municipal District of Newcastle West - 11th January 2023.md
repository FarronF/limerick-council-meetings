NOTICES OF MOTION
Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council take over Ray's estate, Mountcollins,

the E.S.B. connected the lights in January 2021. When will the Council take over the
road?

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council take over the Paddocks, Newcastle
West, twelve years this is going on now.

ice llor T. Ruddle

twill move at the next Meeting that due to the shockingly bad level of service in
fixing blown public lights which are now taking months if at all to get fixed, that
Limerick City and County Council meet with Airtricity with a view to improving the
service.

No lighting leads to anti-social behaviour and people do not feel safe walking around
at night, this should be a priority for this Council.

Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scant

| will move at the next Meeting that all Council delivered tenancies have a front and
back entrance.

| will move at the next Meeting that adequate public lighting is provided along Daar
River View, Newcastle West.

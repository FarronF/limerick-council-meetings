**Delivery Stream**

**Explanation of the Delivery Stream**

**1** **SHIP CONSTRUCTION**

SHIP stands for Social Housing Investment Programme.

100% Exchequer funded new build construction on Council land. Undergoes a 4 stage process with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which means it

has to pass 4 gateways for funding approval. The four stages include 1:Feasibility, 2: Pre-Planning, 3: Pre-Tender and 4: Tender Approval for the Builder. This 4 stage process in

total can take 59 weeks. Managed and Delivered by Limerick City and County Council under LA Construction and Maintenance unit.

**2** **CAS CONSTRUCTION**

CAS stands for Capital Assistance Scheme.

The Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) funding model provides 100% Exchequer funded new build construction on land owned by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). It is used to

deliver specific housing for older people, homeless, and people with a disability or victims of domestic violence. Undergoes a 4 stage process (like SHIP Construction) with the

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which means it has to pass 4 gateways for funding approval. This 4 stage process can take 75 weeks. Managed and

Delivered by AHBs. 4-stage Programme, claims and mortgage oversight by Limerick City and County Council under Housing Strategy and non-LA Construction unit.

**3** **SHIP RENEWAL**

100% Exchequer funded construction on derelict vacant properties. These can be derelict properties acquired, within Local Authority ownership already or derelict properties

vested under a compulsory acquisition. Managed and Delivered by Limerick City and County Council under LA Construction and Maintenance unit.

**4** **SHIP CONSTRUCTION TURNKEY**

Where land is finite and housing demand is high, Limerick City and County Council adds to their stock of new build social housing by contracting developers to deliver new social

housing on privately owned land, based on existing designs and planning permissions. This speeds up the delivery of new homes on private land as it doesn't go through the same

4 stage process as SHIP Construction. For large sites being proposed for turnkeys, Limerick City and County Council has a policy of 30% social, 20% private/private rightsizing and

50% affordable (cost-rental or affordable purchase) to ensure a sustainable tenure and income mix.

**5** **CALF CONSTRUCTION TURNKEY**

CALF stands for Capital Advance Leasing Facility.

It provides financial support to AHBs in the form of a long-term loan to assist with the financing of the acquisition and construction or new build units that will be provided for

social housing use. This loan facility from the Exchequer can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the project, where the units will be provided by the AHB under long-

term lease arrangements to local authorities for social housing use.

The main funding requirements (70%) are sourced by the AHB through private finance arrangements with the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) or other sources. The demand for

and suitability of the properties for social housing must be confirmed by the housing authority.

**6 PART V**

Part Vs in Limerick are delivered as on-site houses as part of private planning permissions. These are 100% funded from the Exchequer. From September 2015. legislation was

introduced allowing LAs to purchase 10% of new developments (ten or more units) for social housing, or, up to 10% of land zoned for housing development at “existing use

value”.

**7 CAS Acquisition**

The Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) funding model provides 100% Exchequer fund for the acquisition and refurbishment of a property by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). Is

subject to an acquisition and refurbishment cap per bed type (e.g., 300,000 for a 4 bed property) in both the city area and the county area. Caps are set down by the Department

of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and reviewed annually.

**8 LA Acquisition: Buy and Renew Scheme**

The LA Acquisition scheme is the 'Buy and Renew Stream' - a funding model that provides 100% Exchequer fund for the acquisition and refurbishment of a vacant property in

poor condition by Local Authorities. Is subject to an acquisition and refurbishment cap per bed type (e.g., 300,000 for a 4 bed property) in both the city area and the county area.

Caps are set down by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and reviewed annually.

**9** **LA RL: Local Authority Repair and Lease**

The Repair and Leasing Scheme, led by the Local Authority, is available to assist private property owners in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country. The

scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. If

eligible for the scheme, the property owner can avail of a loan of up to €60,000 from the local authority to carry out the refurbishment of property.

**10** **Private MTR: Private Mortgage to Rent**

The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme introduced in 2012 is targeted at supporting households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable

by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP); agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and are deemed eligible for social housing support.

The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their

property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider - a private company, Home for Life Ltd. The local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company)

becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.

**11** **LA LTL: Local Authority Long Term Lease**

The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the leasing of houses

and apartments. Dwellings under the scheme come from a number of different sources including private owners, Part V and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). The Council enters

into leasing agreements for periods of up to 25 years. At the end of the leasing term there may be an opportunity to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, should it

become available to buy.

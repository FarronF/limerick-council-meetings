had been sent. It was confirmed that this was posted.

Notices of Motion

5.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M Ryan (moved forward

on agenda as agreed with Elected Members)

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District meeting

that Limerick City and County Council Management and Directors of Services conduct a

review of Staff and current projects in order to allocate all possible Staff and Skills to

Housing Construction and return of voids by prioritising all construction projects.”

**Proposed: Councillor M Ryan**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

**REPLY:**

**“**The Chief Executive has a legal duty to assign staff as appropriate to ensure all services and

functions of the Council are met.

The Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage did agree to fund additional

staffing for the social housing programme earlier in the year and 5 out of the 7 posts have

been filled. The additional 2 posts were of such a level that they were required to be

recruited through PAS and we are currently awaiting start dates. In addition, the DHLGH

recently agreed to fund 4 staff for Affordable Housing. Recruitment is ongoing.

The delivery of construction projects involves more than local authority staff and is reliant

on DHLGH approvals and contractor and materials availability also.”

The Senior Engineer outlined that each Directorate has its own funding and allocation of

staff, and therefore staff cannot be reallocated according to the need.

It was agreed that this Notice of Motion be submitted to the Plenary Council and the

Housing SPC on 14th December.

The Senior Engineer agreed to return to the February meeting of the Municipal District with

an update on the 14 voids.

Questions

7.Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the EV Electric charging points in the area, as previously agreed, and where are the

proposed locations of same.”

**Reply:**

The Council is currently finalising an EV Strategy which will inform on how best to roll out the

development of EV charging points across the County. A construction contract to put in place

the ducting and electrical infrastructure for selectedpilot sites will shortly be advertised with

a view to getting on the ground in early 2023. The public car park fronting the Council offices

in Kilmallock is one of the chosen sites for this contract, along with sites at Bruff, Doon and

Caherconlish . Once the ducting/electrical infrastructure works are in place (scheduled for

Q1,2023), a separate operating contract will be put in place for management and operation

of the EV charging points.

Subject to funding availability, the rollout of further EV charging points in the County will

follow in line with the strategy's rollout policy, with locations to be agreed at that stage.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan

**I will ask at the next Meeting can Limerick City and County Council please provide a legal**

**opinion on the rights of a person to record a public Council meeting, whether in person or**

**online; and to outline, if there is a legal barrier to recording, what sanctions can Limerick**

**City and County Council impose if a meeting is recorded by an individual.**---
13

**REPLY:**

The Standing Orders for Meetings, which are adopted by the Elected Members,

state that no cameras of any kind, or sound recording, or communication

equipment may be used by any person at Meetings of the Council, without

prior approval of the Council.

The Meetings Administrator also begins each Meeting by outlining the

requirements of Standing Orders that any recording is prohibited, i.e. that no

recording of the Meeting and its proceedings by any person, including Elected

Members and attending members of the public and media, shall be allowed.

The Standing Orders also state that any Member of the Council, or any other

attendee, who, in the opinion of the Mayor, transgresses any Standing Order

or refuses to obey the ruling of the Mayor, may be called to order by the

Mayor.

If (s)he persists in her/his refusal to obey the ruling of the Mayor, then the

Mayor may suspend her/him for the remainder of the sitting. The Standing

Orders also outline that the provisions of Section 57(d) of the Local

Government Reform Act 2014 shall apply in relation to disorderly conduct. The

legislation provides for sanctions, including, for example, suspension from

meetings and a reduction in remuneration.

Separately, the recording of a meeting may not be in compliance with the

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and, depending on the

circumstances, there may be legal remedies available therein to an attendee

at a meeting who believes a recording was possibly made and who wishes to

contest same.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan

**I will move at the next Meeting that all public meetings of Limerick City and County Council**

**publicly available.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan and seconded by Councillor Sheehan

**REPLY:**

Section 14 of Schedule 10 of the Local Government Act outlines that the

Minutes of the proceedings of a Meeting of the Council shall be drawn up by

the Meetings Administrator and shall include:

 The date, place and time of the Meeting;

 The names of the Members present at the Meeting;

 The names of the senior employees of the Local Authority present at the

Meeting;

 Reference to any report submitted to the Members at the Meeting.

 Where there is a roll call vote, the number and names of Members voting

for and against the Motion and those abstaining.

 Particulars of all Resolutions passed at the Meeting and such other matters

considered appropriate.

This provision is included in the Standing Orders of the Meeting. The written

Minutes of the Meeting form the record, are publicly available and are

intended to capture the information as set out in the legislation.

With regard to the video recording of Meetings, this topic is currently being

considered by a Working Group of the Corporate Committee of the Local

Government Management Agency (LGMA). The Data Protection Officer

Network is also considering the options. In light of the processing of personal

data involved, there are a number of factors to be considered including the

legal basis for the recording, as well as compliance with principles such as data

minimisation, transparency, purpose limitation and storage limitation.

Processing personal data in this manner would have to demonstrate that the

processing is necessary, proportionate and justified. The Committee will take

a risk-based approach and arrange for a Data Protection Impact Assessment to

be carried out which will be available to each local authority for consideration.

The Meetings Administrator also read the Reply to the earlier Question No. 7 on the

agenda, submitted by Councillor Hartigan, in relation to the same matter, a copy of which had

been circulated to the Members prior to the Meeting.

The Members discussed the merits and risks of recording Meetings and the remedies

available if someone were to record the meeting without permission.

Following further discussion, Councillor Hartigan stated that he was happy to defer

the Motion if legal advice were sought on the matter. The Chief Executive agreed to the

request to seek formal legal advice on the matter.---

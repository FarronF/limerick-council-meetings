Members noted that Sean Broderick was a member of Limerick County Council from 1979 to

1985 and regained his seat in 1991 and served as Chairman of Limerick County Council in

1996/1997. He retired from politics in 2004.

Sean was a very warm, generous, man who had a great love for all things local and had a great

involvement in the church. He was committed to serve Abbeyfeale, West Limerick and

Limerick overall, which he did with great pride.

Outside of politics, they remembered Sean as a successful businessman who ran his own shop

for many years in Abbeyfeale, and a man who played a significant role in many aspects of his

local community.

They also noted that he was a man of deep faith to his church, who had been honoured with

the presentation of a Papal Medal in recognition of his faith and dedication to the church.

The Chief Executive, on behalf of Management and staff, paid tribute to Sean Broderick and

expressed his condolences to Sean’s family and friends, on their loss. He stated that Sean’s

time on Limerick County Council spanned a number of decades and his knowledge of West

Limerick, and as a businessman, gave him a unique perspective on Council matters. He noted

that Limerick is a better place for the mark he made in politics.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Mayor held a minute's silence and reflection as a mark

of respect.

Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

This concluded the Meeting.

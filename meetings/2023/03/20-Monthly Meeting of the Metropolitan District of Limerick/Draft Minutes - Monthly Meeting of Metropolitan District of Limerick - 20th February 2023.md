**QUESTIONS**

**5.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many road sweepers***

***the Council currently deploy in Limerick city and how many mini sweepers/cycle lane sweepers***

***are deployed in the city.***

**REPLY**: The Council currently deploys two large road sweepers, two mini sweepers and one small

hot wash sweeper in Limerick City. The large sweepers service public roads throughout the

city.

The hot wash sweeper is mainly deployed on high quality pavements, for example the

refurbished O’Connell St. and nearby streets.

The mini sweepers are intended mainly for use on cycle lanes however due to the absence

of two compact (medium sized sweepers) they are also deployed in the city centre for

general use on streets and laneways.

The Council has procured two new compact sweepers which are expected to be delivered

in the next couple of months, their arrival will allow the two mini sweepers to concentrate

more on the cycle lanes and will increase the total complement of sweepers operating in

Limerick city to seven.

Canal.  The IDA has undertaken targeted sampling within the Business Park and a report on

this is due imminently, which will help further focus the direction of our investigation.

In addition, the Council has commenced direct engagement with some businesses within

the Park to help identify a possible source of pollution. The Council has also procured a

contractor to carry out sampling on a monthly basis to monitor the profile of the

parameters discharging to the canal. This monthly sampling will begin in February.

**REPLY:** The unfinished building is on the Derelict Site Register and the Vacant Site Register.

Limerick City and County Council have exercised their full powers under the Derelict Site

Act, 1990. LCCC made an application to An Bord Pleanala to compulsory acquire this

property under the Derelict Site Act, 1990. LCCC were refused permission by An Bord

Pleanala to compulsory acquire this site under Section 15 of the Derelict Site Act, 1990.

LCCC have applied a derelict site levy on the site for 2019, 2020, 2021 totalling €149,000.

LCCC Debt Management Unit is pursuing payment of the outstanding Derelict Site Levies.

There is currently a live planning permission on this site.

LCCC will continue to monitor this case.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when will we see a derelict***

***sites levy or other enforcement issued on the owners of the boarded up buildings of 35-37***

***Catherine Street.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council have exercised their full powers under the Derelict Site

Act, 1990. LCCC made an application to An Bord Pleanala to compulsory acquire this site

under the Derelict Site Act, 1990. LCCC were granted permission to compulsory acquire the

site in question in November, 2019. The owners of the site obtained leave to challenge by

way of Judicial Review the decision of An Bord Pleanala. Limerick City and County Council

are still awaiting the outcome of the judicial review.

The site in question is on the Derelict Site Register and the Vacant Site Register. Levies can

only be applied using either Derelict Site Act, 1990 or the Urban Regeneration and Housing

Act, 2015. LCCC used the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act, 2015 to charge levies. The

owners of the site appealed the valuation of the site to the valuation tribunal. In

accordance with the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act, 2015 Limerick City and County

Council cannot charge Vacant Site Levies until such time that the valuation tribunal has

determined a valuation.

Limerick City and County Council will continue to monitor the case.

38 clearly stated the intention to introduce the following road amendments:

 Install new road markings,

 Install new tactile paving,

 Install new footpath and drop-kerbs,

10

**REPLY:** The Council will plant appropriate planting to block off the gaps in the existing hedging at

the rear of Mount Saint Lawrence (Extension) Cemetery.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to Mount St***

**REPLY:** The Council will further address this issue by seeking quotations to have a more permanent

visually aesthetic solution to be put in place for the temporary storage of graveyard spoil.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***proposed Flood Relief Scheme for Annacotty including Mulcair Drive and Mountshannon Road.***

**REPLY:** The Limerick City & Environs Flood Relief Scheme (FRS) is currently in Stage 1 of its

development which consists of options assessment, scheme development and design

stages. The scheme area encompasses the City of Limerick and selected environs situated

in both Limerick and Clare. The areas that are intended to benefit from, and be protected

by the scheme are divided into three main subareas are;

 Subarea 1 – Annacotty;

 Subarea 2 - King’s Island FRS (being advanced separately to the Limerick City & Environs

FRS scheme);

 Subarea 3 - Limerick City Centre.

In particular, the Annacotty area (including Mulcair Drive and Mountshannon Road) has

been identified as an area where potential “quick wins” (i.e. early flood risk management /

scheme implementation) can be utilised for accelerated works. To inform this, Limerick City

& County Council, in partnership with OPW, has requested the appointed consultant (RPS

Consulting Engineers) to identify locations where flood defences may be required to inform

specific locations for advance site investigation works. To facilitate this, ecological surveys

(being undertaken by RPS) and ornithology surveys (by MKO Ireland) are currently ongoing

in this area. Furthermore, an invasive species treatment contractor has been appointed on

a multi-year contract to treat and survey areas where invasive species are present. Subject

to environmental and other constraints, it is anticipated that a geotechnical site

investigation contractor/or contractors will commence site investigation works in Q3 2023

in Annacotty and surrounding areas to determine ground conditions.

In parallel with the above, RPS is currently undertaking detailed hydrological and hydraulic

assessments which will inform flood levels and flood extents in this area to confirm exact

locations at risk of flooding. As per the current programme, the hydraulic assessment of the

scheme area is anticipated to be completed by early autumn 2023. The programme for any

potential advance flood protection works to Annacotty is subject to the above and is

currently under review with a view to submitting for planning consent in mid to late 2025.---
11

Limerick City & County Council has been in recent contact with landowners from the

Annacotty area and is acutely aware of the importance to assess the potential for any quick

wins in delivering flood protection to this key area and will continue to liaise with key

stakeholders and landowners in the area.

Further information and ongoing updates for the scheme may be found at the scheme

website; https://www.floodinfo.ie/frs/en/limerick/home/

**20.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***Mobility Management Measures for Business initiative, with the focus on the Scope 3 emissions***

***and on enabling the big industries in the National Technology Park and Raheen Industrial Estate***

***to switch to sustainable mobility alternatives.***

**REPLY:** The Council is developing this initiative and is actively engaging with businesses at the IDA

National Technology Park in Castletroy and the IDA Raheen Business and Technology

Park.  We have recently hosted open discussions with the businesses at both parks on the

importance of sustainable mobility amongst staff and discussed measures for achieving

behavioural change. Items discussed include:

 LSMATS – Proposed cycle network, proposed bus network and proposed rail network

 BusConnects

 Increasing active travel – walking and cycling

 Roll out of dockless bike scheme

 Shuttle buses during peak hours

 Car pooling

 Car sharing

 Park and Ride

We are currently developing a staff survey, using best practice, which will be administered

through the IDA and individual businesses. The data will help us understand current travel

patterns, modes of travel, and identify behavioural change measures, which will help

achieving modal shift to sustainable modes of travel. We received favourable responses

from participants to this initiative.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

Routes to School Programme. A Preliminary Design has been prepared for these works

which will require a Part 8 approval process. Subject to approval of the Part 8, the process

for which will commence in March, these works will be included in the Mill Road

Construction Project.---

**22.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the plans***

***for the next stage of O’Connell Street upgrade.***

**REPLY:** The next phase of O’Connell Street will be funded by the Urban Regeneration Development

Fund and the National Transport Authority. When initial concept designs are completed, a

workshop will be held with the Elected Members to provide an outline of the proposed

scheme and get their input. This is anticipated to happen in Q2 2023.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council emulate the 'Clean it up you dirty Pup' campaign by Galway City Council to***

***address the growing problem of dog fouling on our public footpaths, parks and civic places. This***

***campaign has seen a 55% reduction in reported incidences of fouling in the selected areas chosen***

***for their campaign.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin referred to the successful campaign that was ran by

Galway City Council, which included additional bins, leaflet drops and stencils on footpaths in

specific areas where there were high incidence rates of dog fouling. He noted that this campaign

in Galway is ongoing but has seen a big reduction in report of dog fouling incidents.

Members supported the Motion acknowledging the importance of it and the need to take action.

Members indicated that if a Pilot Scheme was being rolled out in Limerick, that a location in all

three electoral areas, Limerick City East, West and North, would be considered. Members also

highlighted the need for citizens to be encouraged to report incidents of dog fouling, which could

significantly help to reduce the problem also.

**REPLY**: The Council will undertake research into the Galway City Council campaign and will consider

whether it could be implemented in Limerick.

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council write to***

***the Minister for Transport, Transport infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport to***

***allocate additional funding to Limerick Council to prioritise footpaths in the city for gritting in***

***extreme weather conditions.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Benson and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan referred to the lack of funding for gritting footpaths

and that these should be prioritised in the future. Members agreed with the Motion, highlighting---
13

the importance of it and the need for more funding.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a suitable derelict***

***site in Limerick city be retained by Limerick Council for community use as community groups have***

***no spaces to use within the city centre.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Benson and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan highlighted the challenges experienced by Arts and

Cultural Groups in locating spaces, with a scarcity of units to rent in the city centre. Members

welcomed the Motion, and acknowledged the need to support and provide spaces to community

groups.

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council may acquire derelict sites compulsorily under the Derelict

Sites Act, 1990 (as amended) where an owner does not deal with the issue of dereliction

on their land. Acquired sites may be used for purposes connected with the functions of the

local authority.

Derelict sites normally require significant capital investment that needs to be addressed,

particularly for those retained, prior to allocation. In addition, under Derelict Sites

legislation, the Council is liable for the payment of compensation to the former landowner

that would also need to be funded as part of any future use of suitable property.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Active Travel***

***Department of the Council will consider a programme of works on the Fairgreen Road including***

***traffic management and the installation of a proper footpath from Fairview AFC to St. Patricks***

***Road.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor Secas and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) referred to the large volume of traffic on the

Fairgreen Road and the need to improve infrastructure in the area. Members welcomed this

Motion, and noted the need for improvements on this road.

**REPLY**: Due to the existing narrow road widths, property boundaries and existing topography on

the Fairgreen Road between Fairview AFC and the St. Patricks Road junction, the installation

of meaningful improvements to the footpaths is not currently feasible within the current

two-way traffic management system that currently is in operation on the Fairgreen Road.

Limerick City and County Council Roads Department will however examine the feasibility of

introducing a one-way traffic management system on the Fairgreen Road from the

Ballysimon Cresent junction to the St. Patricks Road junction which would include a public

consultation process. This proposal could also cater for a new raised footpath on the---
14

Fairgreen Road from Fairview AFC to the St. Patricks Road junction. The delivery of this

scheme will be determined on the outcome of the consultation process and funding

availability.

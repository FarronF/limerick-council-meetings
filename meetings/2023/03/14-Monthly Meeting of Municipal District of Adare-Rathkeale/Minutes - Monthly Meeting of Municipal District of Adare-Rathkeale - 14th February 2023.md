**Water Services**

The A/Senior Executive Officer, Water Services gave Members an update on the upcoming

transition of Limerick City and County Council Water Services to direct management by

Uisce Éireann, formerly Irish Water which includes a new management unit, the unifying

of services from mid-March and a legal handover over a four year period. These new

arrangements will remove Water Services from Council Meetings and Elected Members

will liaise directly with Uisce Éireann. Rural water will remain the responsibility of Limerick

City and County Council and will prioritise vulnerable customers, who are encouraged to

engage with the Council and register as a vulnerable customer.

Discussion ensued and Members expressed concerns in relation to 145 staff Members

from Water Services who currently work on behalf of Irish Water. The A/Senior Executive

Officer advised the Elected Members each staff Member will have the option of

transferring to Uisce Éireann on a permanent basis or being reassigned to a suitable

vacancy within Limerick City and County Council. Staff members will continue to work

with Uisce Éireann until they decide on their personal preference and handover

arrangements have been completed. The A/Senior Executive Officer concluded that

Members can contact Uisce Éireann on the dedicated Councillor phone line and email or

they can also contact her.

**QUESTIONS**

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary**

**I will ask at the next Meeting why Limerick City and County Council granted planning**

**permission for two developments in Adare Village without first having procured proper**

**and adequate storm water connectivity for approximately sixty houses. Planning**

**Reference 198010 and Planning Reference 19/684.**

**REPLY:**

1.

The basis of the decision by the Planning Authority to grant planning permission

under Plg. Ref. 19/684 is a matter of public record. The design proposals for the

surface water drainage system were provided by the developer as part of this

planning process and were assessed in accordance with technical standards. The

Planning Authority also attached site specific conditions in relation to the surface

water disposal system and to be met prior to the commencement of

development. The onus is on the applicant to ensure all necessary consents are in

place prior to the commencement of development.

2.

Application number 198010 refers to a Part 8 planning application. Planning for

31 housing units and 8 affordable plots was approved by the members in early

2020. Surface Water and Foul Water Connectivity were included in the proposal.

We are finalising surface water connectivity at present.

We expect construction to commence on site in late 2023.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary**

**I will ask at the next Meeting why Limerick City and County Council sold their land bank**

**of circa eleven acres to a private developer without foul sewer or storm water**

**connectivity being available.**

**REPLY:**

Following an Expression of Interest process in 2017, the S183 for disposal, was approved

at full council in September 2018, subject to planning permission, which has not yet been

achieved and consequently the disposal has not completed.

Surface water connectivity would be dealt with as part of the planning application.

As part of the disposal contract, conditions were included in relation to the treatment of

foul sewer connectivity which were to be provided in conjunction with Limerick City and

County Council.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary**

**I will ask at the next Meeting as to what progress has been made on the**

**design/refurbishment and future re-opening of the Bank of Ireland building at Main**

**Street, Rathkeale.**

**REPLY:**

Innovate Limerick has been tasked with responsibility to bring forward a plan for the

future use of the old Bank of Ireland Building in Rathkeale. Innovate Limerick has

commenced the procurement process to appoint a Design Team to carry out feasibility

reports and to develop an agreed scheme that can be brought through the appropriate

planning process.

Once approved through planning Limerick City and County Council and Innovate

Limerick will also be seeking funding through Rural Regeneration Development Fund and

Town and Village Grants to deliver the approved scheme which will be a good example

of deliver on Governments Town Centre first Policy.

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary**

**I will move at the next Meeting, due to the recent public order incident in Rathkeale**

**Town, that Limerick City and County Council construct two additional speed ramps at**

**the southern and northern ends of Roches Road in the interest of health and safety for**

**road users at this location.**

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor Teskey

and agreed.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keary advised this is an exceptional case regarding

traffic calming in Rathkeale. He had already discussed this matter with the Chief

Superintendent and the Chief Executive. He indicated that during the policing review of

the town he was endeavouring to have the ramps installed as part of this review.

**REPLY:**

As a result of numerous requests for Traffic Calming over the years, Limerick City and

County Council adapted a Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas in 2018.

This Policy requires any requests for Traffic Calming be accompanied by a plebiscite of

residents in which two thirds of the residents on the street affected have indicated they

are in favour of traffic calming. Any such plebiscite shall be restricted to residents living

within 100m of the location of the proposed traffic calming measures.

On foot of any requests with appropriate plebiscite, speed surveys are required to be

carried out to justify any interventions and to verify a problem exists and is not just a

perception.

If a scheme proceeds to design stage , a formal public consultation shall take place

generally as outlined in Section 38 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act.

A source of funding also needs to be identified for any proposed Traffic Calming

schemes. A Plebiscite has been submitted for Roches Road.

However, 2 separate Traffic Surveys carried out in 2022 ( one just prior to Christmas

period over an 8 day period) do not justify any interventions in accordance with Council

policy.

Accordingly, there are no plans to carry out Traffic Calming on Roches Road.

The elected members requested that the disposal be deferred until the March Meeting of

the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District. It was agreed that a resolution would be

sought legally prior to the March meeting.

An Cathaoirleach outlined that he declared the issue had been sufficiently debated.

4. Deputation by Caherguillamore Memorial Committee

The Deputation outlined the events of the Caherguillamore Ambush in 1920 and the

proposed memorial signage which has been submitted to the Civic Memorial Committee for

approval.

The Elected members expressed their support for the project.

5. Water Services

An Cathaoirleach outlined local issues relating to water supply to the Executive members of

the Water Services Section that were present.

The Senior Engineer, Administrative Officer and Director of Services outlined the upcoming

changes, whereby Uisce Eireann will be taking over the operations of Water Services from

the end of March, and there will be a 4 year transition for staff. The Administrative Officer

for Water Services advised the Elected Members to utilise the Uisce Eireann Councillor

Clinics in relation to highlighting issues. There is also the option of contacting the Local Reps.

Control Desk for small items, such as leaking stopcocks, etc. She told the meeting that

“vulnerable people” should be registered with Uisce Eireann, and these are highlighted in

the event of a water outage, etc. She also outlined that the operation of Water Services is

now a National utility and therefore no longer the responsibility of the Local Authority (from

the end of March 2023). This will mean that Questions and Notices of Motion from Elected

members will go directly to Uisce Eireann.

The Administrative Officer and Senior Engineer outlined that they will be working with the

transition team to support a smooth transition.

The Elected members wished to acknowledge the work of the staff in Water Services of

Limerick City and County Council to date.

6. Hidden Heartlands

Marie Healy, Hidden Heartlands, outlined the geographical region within County Limerick

covered by Hidden Heartlands, i.e. the same geographical region covered by Ballyhoura

Development CLG. Ms Healy also outlined the branding and website relating to the Hidden

Heartlands initiative. A presentation on the region was delivered to the Elected members

and leaflets circulated.

Notices of Motion

7.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

“I will move at the next meeting of Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that the Local

Authority supply an extra Truck for patching potholes in the area. It is a huge area with the

longest kilometers of roads particularly during the winter months where we have consistent

heavy rain and floods with heavy frosts where staff are under severe pressure. It saves

money from damage and claims and promotes safety on our roads long term.”

**Proposed: Councillor Mitchell**

**Seconded: Councillor E Ryan**

**REPLY:**

The weather conditions experienced during the current winter has resulted in more

significant damage to road surfaces that would normally be experienced. The Cappamore-

Kilmallock MD have an additional Velocity Patcher engaged from the 7th Feb on a temporary

basis to repair damaged roads across the District.

8.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District that a schedule be put in place to remove

the grass ridge growing in the middle of many local/tertiary roads which are otherwise in good

condition.”

**Proposed: Councillor Teefy**

**Seconded: Councillor E Ryan**

**REPLY:**

This issue is extremely common on a good portion of the road network across the Municipal District.

It is not feasible to carry out a full programme of such works as it would divert resources from other

maintenance duties for a significant period of time. It is suggested that if roads with excessive

growth are identified as causing issues for traffic, then the Municipal District office will look at

appropriate measures for treatment

9.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District calling on

Limerick City and County Council to promote and allocate grant funding to support the 2023

Annual St. Patrick’s Day Parades planned within the Municipal District.”

**Proposed: Councillor Donegan**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan**
---
**REPLY:**

The Festivals and Events team have put in place a grant scheme for St Patrick’s Day Parades

around the county and within each municipal district. This scheme has been communicated

to the elected members and relevant community groups.

*The Elected members requested that the Director of Services for the Cappamore Kilmallock*

*Municipal District contact the Director of Services for Community, Tourism and Culture to*

*request that additional funding be made available to County based St Patricks day festivals.*

*An email was circulated to all Members in the days after the meeting clarifying the issue in*

*relation to funding of festivals.*

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will move at the next MD meeting that Active Travel Funding be made available for a pedestrian

crossing and footpath at Anglesboro National School to address serious safety issues and concerns,

similar to what was made available in the last couple of years to Ballylanders NS and Martinstown

NS.

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor E Ryan**

**REPLY:**

The Municipal District had previously proposed to construct a new footpath from the school to the

village. The existing carriageway is not wide enough for such works and therefore land acquisition is

required. The land required in unavailable to Limerick City and County Council at present and

therefore the scheme cannot proceed.

*It was suggested by the Councillor Carey that the land required be investigated regarding*

*availability again.*

Questions

Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the taking in charge of Cluain Foinse Estate in Hospital by Limerick City and County Council.

**Reply:**

Cluain Foinse is currently included on the Council’s 2023 Taking in Charge work programme. The

bond has been drawn down. Therefore, it is estimated that the formal procedures to take the estate

in charge and works will commence in Q4 2023.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District what process

would be involved for ramps to be installed on the Hospital Emly road outside Cluain Foinse

Estate before the Doctors Surgery on the Emly side and entrance to Galtee View Estate on

the Hospital side to slow traffic and in the interests of safety for all road users.”

**Reply:**

The Municipal district Office will conduct speed surveys at the locations identified by Cllr. Mitchell. If

it is determined that vehicles are exceeding the speed limit, suitable traffic calming measures will be

designed and a cost estimate prepared for submission to the relevant funding agency

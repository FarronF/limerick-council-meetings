**REPLY:** Engagement with relevant stakeholders is a key part of the Regeneration process. The

Regeneration Directorate will link in with the Parish / Diocese in relation to their plans for

**8.Question submitted by Councillor M. Murphy**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick have Limerick City and***

***County Council put any measures in place to deal with the effects of Hymenoscyphus Fraxineus***

***(Ash dieback) on roadside trees and open public spaces.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council Roads department do not implement any control measure

to deal with the effects of Hymenoscyphus Fraxineus (Ash dieback) on roadside trees. It is

up to the landowner or property owner to maintain trees and hedges along their property

road boundaries as per Section 70 of the Roads Act.

In the context of public trees, the Council is taking a more proactive approach to tree

maintenance as cases arise through the SUGAR CRM platform. When a case is submitted

for a particular tree in a housing estate, the Council inspects all trees in the housing estate.

If there are ash trees present, they are checked for evidence of ash dieback. These trees will

be monitored and the Council will address on a case by case basis and may carry out

remedial works where necessary.

In the longer term, the tree policy, which is currently at draft stage, recognises the potential

danger of ash dieback. The policy proposes to assess the threat posed to public trees from

it and develop an action plan to manage the threat to public trees.

document, which forms part of the Limerick Development Plan 2022 – 2028 and was

**12.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a breakdown of the***

***projects during 2023.***

**REPLY**: Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC (LTT) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Limerick City and County

Council. Limerick 2030 as an independent company with its own Board of Directors and

carries out a wide range of work and these can be split into two categories as follows;

1. Work carried out by Limerick Twenty Thirty to develop its own assets and these are

funded by Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC’s own resources that they make from rental

income on its property portfolio, grants i.e. URDF and income from commercial

partnerships and loans agreements.

2. Work carried out by Limerick Twenty Thirty on assets owned by Limerick City & County

Council for which a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is put in place each year and a fee is

agreed for the works.

At this stage of the year it is not possible to advise on what the breakdown of the

anticipated costs that will be incurred in 2023 will be for Limerick City and County Council

as the overall work program of Limerick Twenty Thirty for 2023 has to be agreed and

approved by its Board. I anticipate that we will have a clearer picture of these costs later in

Quarter One.

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council Roads Traffic and Cleansing Department currently employs

72 outdoor staff operatives including Supervisors with 3 current open vacancies in the

Limerick Metropolitan district. The number of outdoor staff in this area has remained

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

Following a request from Councillor Kilcoyne and with the agreement of the Cathaoirleach, the

following Notice of Motion was taken at this stage of the Meeting:

**19.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council will explore the purchasing or leasing of land for railway stations with park and***

***ride facilities in the Adare, Patrickswell, Raheen and Dooradoyle areas for commuter rail travel***

***to Limerick city.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor Leddin and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kilcoyne referred to the proposed upgrade of the Foynes to

Limerick Railway line and the positive benefits this would bring to Limerick and in particular the

city centre area. He highlighted the need to market this line for passengers, as well as commercial

use purposes, and the importance of having park and ride facilities.

Councillor Secas proposed that the Motion be amended to include the Castletroy / Annacotty area.

This was agreed.

Members supported the Motion acknowledging the importance of it. Members also referred to

the works being carried out on the railway line in the Raheen / Dooradoyle area, and expressed

disappointment at the lack of communication received from Iarnród Eireann by Members, and

residents in the areas, on the proposed upgrade works. Members requested that Iarnród Eireann

be contacted to request that they provide a Briefing on the upgrade works and what

communication had taken place with the local residents.

**REPLY**: The recently published LSMATS identifies proposals for rail transport development. It

identifies specific measures as short-term delivery aims, including the reinstatement of the

Limerick to Foynes railway line to provide a freight service.  It also commits to examine the

feasibility of providing a commuter rail network for the LSMA, including the re-use of the

Foynes and Mungret lines.  However it identifies this as a longer-term rail planning aim,

which requires land use policies identifying potential rail stations locations requiring more

intensive population development in future Limerick Development plans.  This will have to

be explored in conjunction with RSES from a forward planning perspective.

LSMATS has a specific objective for rail based Park and Ride provision at Ballysimon and an
---
8

objective of investigating the potential for further Park and Ride facilities where the

strategic road network meets high frequency rail services.

With this in mind, LCCC propose to work with the NTA to develop a Park and Ride facility at

Raheen.  This site will primarily be a road based facility but could potentially double up in

time as a dual Rail/Road Park and Ride, depending on the commuter rail progression in the

area.  Progression of the other potential rail sites mentioned (Adare, Patrickswell and

Dooradoyle) is primarily a responsibility of Iarnrod Éireann and the governing authority, the

NTA, but will be dependent on the outcome of the commuter rail feasibility study that will

be carried out.  LCCC will of course support both Iarnrod Éireann and the NTA in the

development of viable sustainable rail proposals.

**14.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council provide Members with an update on the progress of implementing the objectives***

***of our Tourism Development Strategy 2019-2023.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin referred to the current Tourism Development Strategy,

which had four key themes, and its importance to Limerick, especially with events such as the Ryder

Cup due to take place in 2027. Members agreed the importance of maximising the potential for

tourism opportunities in Limerick City and County.

**REPLY**: The Council will organise a workshop to update Members on the progress of the Tourism

Strategy 2019-2023.

**15.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a Workshop be***

***arranged for Members by Limerick City and County Council to consider and discuss measures to***

***ensure that our Christmas festival activities for 2023 and future years maximises our potential in***

***increase visitors to our city and county.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin referred to the various events that took place in the city

during the Christmas period and the importance of marketing the events, for families and the many

visitors that returned to Limerick for Christmas. He referred to the success of Christmas festivals in

Waterford and Galway, and elsewhere.

Members supported the Motion and highlighted the success of the Milk Market at Christmas time

and the Christmas Event, ‘A Christmas Tale at the Castle’, held in King John’s Castle. They noted

that the Milk Market also attracts big numbers at Christmas time. Members agreed the importance

of identifying what worked well previously and what aspects needed to be improved, in order to

enhance the experience at future Christmas events in Limerick.

**REPLY**: The Council will organise a workshop with Members to consider and discuss measures for

Christmas in Limerick 2023.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council write to the Health Service Executive regarding the out of hours Limerick Doc***

***based in Dooradoyle, asking them to upgrade this important service, because at present it is not***

***a satisfactory service for its users.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Benson and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery referred to the large number of people who had

difficulty accessing the out of hour’s services in the past number of weeks and the need for

additional staff to be allocated to this service. Members supported the motion, and acknowledged

the need to add additional resources to this service.

**17.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to the***

***Minister for Social Protection to ask if widows / widowers can be considered for half rate illness***

***benefit, once the applicant meets the criteria set out under the current scheme.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kiely outlined the financial difficulties that widows / widowers

can encounter, and discrepancies in the interpretation of rules regarding eligibility for same, which

needed to be addressed urgently. Members supported this motion, and agreed that this would

give widows/widowers some extra financial support at a time when they need it most.

**18.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that footpaths in the city***

***centre and around key locations,*** ***such as schools, shops, post offices, etc., as well as roads in***

***certain housing estates where their landscape warrants it, are included in the Winter***

***Maintenance Plan.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas referred to the importance of gritting roads and

footpaths as part of the Winter Maintenance Plan, in particular around key locations such as

hospitals and schools. Members welcomed this motion, and agreed there is a need to grit

important areas in the City and surrounding areas. Members noted that the Milk Market is a key

area, and pointed out that it needs to be added to the Winter Maintenance Plan as a priority area,

along with any other highly trafficked pedestrian areas.
---
10

**REPLY**: With approximately 4,000 kms of roadway in County Limerick, it is not possible to treat all

the County roads as part of Limerick City and County Council’s normal Winter Maintenance

programme. Priority is given to the National Strategic Regional Road Network, which carries

the most intensive volumes of commuter traffic.

Typically, Limerick City and County Council treat up to 20% of the road network for a given

weather event. It is not possible to include all footpaths and housing estates in the winter

maintenance programme.

In more severe and\or, prolonged cold snaps the District Engineers review the need for

additional treatments. Such actions are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and the extent

of such additional measures will relate to the availability of resources.

It was agreed that a Briefing on the Winter Maintenance Plan would be arranged for Members.

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

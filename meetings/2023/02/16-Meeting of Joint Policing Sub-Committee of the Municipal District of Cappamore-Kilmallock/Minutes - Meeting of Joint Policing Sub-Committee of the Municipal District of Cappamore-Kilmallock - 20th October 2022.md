2.Policing Issues in the District

An Cathaoirleach wished to compliment An Garda Siochana on a meeting held earlier in October

to discuss Anti Social behaviour. He also wished to welcome Inspector James Ruddle to the

meeting and thanked Superintendent Dermot O’Connor who previously attended the Joint

Policing Committee meetings in the Municipal District.

Superintendent Brennan commenced by addressing the questions that had been submitted by

the Elected Members since the July meeting.

Regarding Antisocial behaviour it was noted that 2 new Gardai would be starting in the

Kilmallock Barracks in Unit D. It was highlighted that the public should contact 999 in case of

emergency rather than the local Garda Station as calls would be guaranteed to be answered.

This is not due to the Garda Station not being manned, but that the Gardai may be attending to

another call. When 999 is used the closest patrol available to the incident will respond and the

log of the call will be permanent.

In relation to speeding it was noted that there were 267 speed detections in 2021 compared to

227 in 2022 (not including detections by the speed van). The best deterrant against speed was

highlighted as being the driver feedback signs.

Details of the new Policing model were outlined. Where previously 2 districts existed in County

Limerick, this has been amalgamated into one, to be known as the Limerick County Community

Engagement area. One Superintendent will be covering this Community Engagement Area, and

one Superintendent (Gda Dermot O’Connor) will be covering the Crime Unit. Should the value

of a theft exceed €7,000 this will be dealt with by the crime unit.

Other changes include the Performance and Assurance area to deal with Risk/Audit/Governance

and streamlining the court system and GSOC complaints. The Business Services area covers

Finance and Human Resource Management.

**Bruff Division**

Acting Superintendent Brennan outlined that it is important to advise constituents that there is

a possibility of an increase in burglaries in the run up to Christmas, and that alarms and

security lights etc should be utilised.

Acting Superintendent Brennan also confirmed that Superintendent Andrew Lacey would be

covering the Roxboro district at JPC meetings moving forward.

An outline of the priorities for An Garda Siochana in the run up to Christmas was provided for

the Elected Members including : Speeding, Drink Driving, Seatbelt and Phone Use while driving.

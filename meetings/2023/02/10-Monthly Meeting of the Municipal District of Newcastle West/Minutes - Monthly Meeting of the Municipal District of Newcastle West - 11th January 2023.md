The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Environment Awareness Officer (Ms. S. McDonnell),

Chairperson, Newcastle West Tidy Towns (Ms. V. Nash) and the Deputy Chairperson, Limerick

Fairtrade (Sr. Delia O’Connor) to the Meeting.

Ms. McDonnell made a presentation to the Members on the background to Fairtrade and

thanked the Members of the Newcastle West Municipal District who passed a Motion in April

2021 in favour of Newcastle West becoming a Fairtrade Town.

She outlined to the Members the meaning of Fairtrade whereby Fairtrade Company pays the

farmer a fair price for products and also gives extra money to the co-operative called a

premium. She stated that the Fairtrade premium is spent on developing the community e.g.

building schools, bringing water to villages, building clinics or whatever the community needs.

She said that more than 7 million people in Africa, Asia and Latin America have benefit from

Fairtrade and stated that 500 million smallholder farmers produce 70% of the world’s food

but are currently half of the world’s hungry people. She stated that the Fairtrade premium is

vital for Fairtrade farmers as this is the price over and above the minimum price.

She outlined to the Members the various steps required to become a Fairtrade town which

include Newcastle West Tidy Towns setting up a Fairtrade sub-group to include

representatives from Limerick City and County Council and various other groups to achieve

Fairtrade town status. She stated that the group has the support of the Limerick City Fairtrade

group who meet a minimum of twice during the year and shares experience with other

Fairtrade communities.

She gave an outline to the Members on the various projects and events which are to take

place in 2023 to promote Fairtrade and also stated that the Newcastle West Fairtrade Group

will support and work with schools, local retailers, hospitality venues, Council’s and

businesses to promote Fairtrade. She referred to the Fairtrade Fortnight 2023 which is to

take place shortly and it is hoped to apply for Fairtrade Status for Newcastle West in Q3/Q4

2023.

She referred to SDG’s which are now embedded in the National Tidy Towns Competition and

to the twelve SDG goals which are prioritised by Fairtrade. She also referred to the various

challenges facing farmers/producers in the developing world such as Climate Change, Low

prices for their products and Covid19.

Ms. Nash gave a summary on the work ongoing at present in Newcastle West with regard to

promoting Fairtrade and to the importance of everyone in getting involved and working

together to achieve Fairtrade Status for Newcastle West.---

Sr. D O’Connor referred to the importance of schools being made aware of the importance of

Fairtrade and asked if the Council could assist in this matter.

The Members thanked the Group and expressed full support in the promotion of Fairtrade in

the District. Reference was also made to extending Fairtrade to other towns in the District

and in replying, Ms. McDonnell stated that any Tidy Towns Group can endeavour to achieve

Fairtrade status.

At this stage, Councillor Sheahan joined the Meeting.

I sent an application to Transport Infrastructure Ireland on the 1st December 2022. The

proposal is to extend the path by 250m as far as the junction of the N21 with the L1325. This

will then promote a walking Loop which would promote active travel and provide alternatives

to the residents for access into the Greenway from local B&B. In addition, the path would

provide safer access for residents and safer access to the town park. The proposed works

would include for the construction of the new path, drainage, ducting, public lighting and

associated works. We are still awaiting a reply from TII.

The Paddocks is currently included on the Council’s work programme to be taken in charge.

the formal taking in charge process will be commenced in 2023.

on a number of matters including service charges applied to properties and management

company within the estate.

Following discussion, it was agreed that an up to date list of housing estates which have been

***Council meet with Airtricity with a view to improving the service.***

8

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

It is Council policy to provide own door access for houses and apartments alike. As with

current design policy, individual front and rear door access is provided to all detached, semi-

detached and terraced housing. However, it is not possible to provide rear door access from

apartment or first floor duplex type units. In accordance with Part B of the Building

Regulations, design standards dictate escape through either protected corridors or windows.

As stated above, in line with LCCC policy, we ensure that own front door access is provided to

apartments and duplex type units. Rear door access/egress from such units would require

additional stairs to the rear of the building which would impact privacy, site size and therefore

cost of construction, and such abnormal costs would not be covered by the DHLGH.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan expressed dissatisfaction at the need for Council

tenants of mid terrace properties to bring wheelie bins through their homes and reiterated

that all Council rented properties should have a front and rear access to their properties.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that adequate public lighting is provided along Daar River***

***View, Newcastle West.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY: Daar River View Estate is not in the charge of Limerick City and County Council.

Limerick City and County Council has written to the developer/their agents of

the estate requesting that the public lighting be repaired as a matter of

urgency.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that public lighting be provided at Daar

River View estate, Newcastle West.

The following items were also raised.

An update was sought on the upgrade of the electricity supply at Clash, Athea and in replying

the Executive Engineer stated that contact has been made with the ESB with a view to

resolving this matter.

Reference was made to the provision of a footpath between the Kerry Co-Op and the speed

limit along the Bruff Line at Clooneyskehane and in replying the Senior Executive Engineer

stated that an application has been made to the National Transport Authority for the

provision of funding to include a full design and appointment of a consultant.---

ESB to remove the poles which will form part of the footpath widening works in Mountcollins.

An update was sought on the provision of a bus shelter in the village of Templeglantine and

in replying the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the necessary equipment for installation

of the bus shelter is expected to arrive this month.

The excellent work carried out by the Roads Team, Newcastle West Municipal District during

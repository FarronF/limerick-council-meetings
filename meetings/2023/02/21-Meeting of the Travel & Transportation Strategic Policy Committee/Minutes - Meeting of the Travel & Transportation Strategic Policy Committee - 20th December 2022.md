Cllr. Mc Sweeney asked who will be funding the maintenance of the Park and Ride infrastructure

and what is the timeline for the City Traffic Management plan. He also enquired what input and

autonomy the Councillors will have in relation to approving schemes.

In response to Cllr Secas, Mr. Creegan advised that the LSMATS is a strategy document as against

an implementation plan. The NTA can give guidance on the sequencing of projects, but

implementation is a matter for the Council. Certain funds are ring fenced i.e., there is a national

€350m p.a. allocation for Active Travel for distribution throughout the LAs.

In response to Cllr. Mc Sweeney, Mr. Creegan advised that maintenance of infrastructure will be

raised at national level. The NTA is making a joint effort with the executive to progress the traffic

management plan for the city. He added that Councillors do make decisions and the format for

this is agreed with the Council. Critical mass and infrastructure is required for Active Travel (AT)

schemes and the NTA is respectful of democracy however, the NTA funding will be dependent on

schemes meeting certain objectives and standards.

Cllr. O Donovan stated that the distribution vehicle for TFI Bikes is currently a diesel run van.

She has concerns regarding the current model of funding and the lack of connection between the

AT schemes. She was disappointed that there was no mention of Shannon Airport in the

document with regard to mitigation.

Cllr. Ryan queried if Rapid Transit system would be an advantage as this would make Park and

Ride more viable. He stated that the full completion of the Ring Road (LNDR) is called for asked if

there was any update. He added that HGVs are toll free in the Dublin Port Tunnell and asked if

this is something that could be examined for Limerick.

Cllr. Novak asked how flexible the strategy is and in light of the new Climate Action plan, how will

it deliver public transport policy. She also queried how delivery of the cycling network can be

delivered in timely manner and what can be achieved by rail link with Shannon Airport.

In response to Cllr. O Donovan, Mr. Creegan advised that the TFI bike scheme will be retendered

in 18 months’ time and part of the contract will be using an electric distribution vehicle. As

regards lack of connection, the Council, in conjunction with the NTA has identified a core bike

network and the most important routes will be developed first. As regards aviation emissions,

the NTA has no role in this as it is not within the remit of the NTA.

Mr. Creegan also added that high frequency bus transport achieves the same as Rapid Transit

vehicles. Articulated vehicles are not suitable to Limerick city. Removal of LNDR from the strategy

was on the direction of the Minister. Dublin port tunnel was built especially for HGVs and these

HGVs still pay tolls on M50.

In response to Cllr Novak, Mr. Creegan advised that all routes are indicative and flexible. There

are benefits of rail to Shannon airport however it is some years away yet.

Cllr. Mitchell concurred with Cllr. Ryan regarding the omission of the LNDR, citing its importance

for ease of access to UL and Plassey and the movement of freight to Europe. He urged to look to

the future.

Cllr. Secas queried the provision of bus shelters and RTPI signage. In response, Mr. Creegan

stated he cannot argue regarding the omission of the LNDR, he was under instructions from the

Minister and added that the LSMATS is a strategy looking to the future. He also added that if a

location is important enough to put in a Bus Shelter, then RTPI signs will be integrated in new bus

shelters.

Mr. Kennedy thanked the NTA and the members for their contribution.

**Item 2: Minutes**

The Minutes of the Meetings of the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee held

on the 25th October 2022 were proposed by Cllr. D. McSweeney, seconded by Cllr. M. Ryan and

adopted.

**Item 3:** **EV Strategy Presentation** **–** **Draft 1** **–** **Mr. John McCarthy, Arups**

Mr. John McCarthy delivered a presentation on EV strategy and explained that Arup was asked

to develop an Electric Vehicle Charge Point Strategy for Limerick City and County Council up to

2030. He included a pilot proposal of 13 locations for EV charging points within County Limerick.

The members thanked Mr. McCarthy for the presentation and the Chair opened the floor to

questions. Cllr. McSweeney asked if Patrickswell could be included on the list for charging points.

Cllr Secas supported the proposals and asked where the pilot site will be located at Castletroy

College and if EV laneways on motorways would be included in the Plan for the strategy in Ireland.

Cllr. Mitchell requested that Hospital be included in the site list and if the ESB will have the

monopoly on charging costs. He welcomed the strategy but stated that competition is needed

to keep costs down.

Cllr. O’Donovan wished the following points noted:

 Not enough charging points in the city and asked who enforces parking at EV charging points

 Locations can be poorly lit and suggested they should be well lit with traffic going by.

 Will E Bikes be accommodated at charging points

 Is the current law that car parks have to install charging points

The Chair stated that the current strategy is based on the premise that 80% of charging will

happen at home and asked where will the space be for EV charging. She also referred to terraced

houses, probably being the most difficult for home charging.

Cllr. Ryan asked if the next phase is imminent. He noted Bruff and Kilmallock are on the list and

they are quite close and could be spread out better.

In response, Mr. Gallagher agreed there are not enough charging points, and charging locations

should be well lit. Charging for E Bikes will not be included at present and the current thought

process for terraced houses is to examine mobile devices to facilitate. In relation to EV laneways,

Mr. Gallagher advised that this has been trialed in road technology but added that the

underground wires are not mature enough to accommodate EV’s. With regard to the policing of

parking at EV stations, this will be investigated.

Cllr. Mitchell suggested that there would be substantial income from charges and would like the

LA be the lead service provider. In response Mr. Gallagher advised that installing ducting can

readily be done by an LA however, running charging stations requires a big resource and this will

be left to the market to decide.

In response to Cllr. McSweeney, Mr. Gallagher confirmed that Active Travel will be commencing

a scheme next month and advised that he will meet with Cllr. McSweeney to locate an area in

Patrickswell, where power is readily available. Mr. Gallagher also advised that he will send the

location map for Castletroy College to Cllr. Secas.

Mr. McCarthy also added that there are a number of different providers in the market, so there

is healthy competition. In relation to the next phase, the success of the 13 sites on the list will

dictate the market. The success will also be dependent on securing funding.

**Item 4: Update on trip to Holland** **–** **Mr. Sean McGlynn**

Mr. McGlynn delivered a presentation on a recent trip to Utrecht city in the Netherlands and

described the city as a world leader in bicycle parks and facilitating cyclist innovative ways.

The members thanked Mr. McGlynn for the presentation.

**Item 5: Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr Martin Ryan**

I ask this SPC to engage with the Minister for Transport asking that any civil works due on the

Limerick/Foynes Rail Line reinstatement will future proof the line to become a dual line. I ask

this to prevent incurring extra costs at later stages.

Cllr. McSweeney seconded the Notice of Motion and hopes the Foynes line will include

passenger rail. He requested that Irish Rail be invited to a future Meeting to brief the

members.

Mr. Kennedy advised that the Notice of Motion would be submitted as a recommendation to

Full Council from the SPC. Cllr. Ryan thanked Mr. Kennedy and suggested inviting Shannon

Foynes Port Company to do a presentation at the SPC.

Mr. Kennedy advised that a request can be made to invite Iarnród Éireann and Shannon Foynes

Port Company to a future SPC Meeting.

The Chair thanked the presenters and members for their contribution and wished all a Happy and

Peaceful Christmas. The meeting then concluded.

NOTICES OF MOTION

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

| will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that
Limerick City and County Council supply an extra Truck for patching potholes in the area. It
is a huge area with the longest kilometers of roads in County Limerick, particularly during
the winter months where we have consistent heavy rain and floods with heavy frosts
where staff are under severe pressure. It saves money from damage and claims and
promotes safety on our roads long term.

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

I will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District that a schedule be put in place to
remove the grass ridge growing in the middle of many local/tertiary roads which are
otherwise in good condition.

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan

| will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District calling on
Limerick City and County Council to promote and allocate grant funding to support the

The Director, on behalf of Management and Staff thanked the Acting Superintendent and Gardaí

for their help and support in the District and wished everyone well in their new roles.

The Members referred to the frequent turnover of Gardaí and Superintendents assigned to the

Newcastle District, as consistency is required in order to progress policing plans and also wished

to be informed of any change to administration in the District.

The Members also referred to a recent visit by the Minister of Justice, Ms H. McEntee to the

District to announce the submission of a planning application for the construction of a new

District Garda Headquarters in Newcastle West and expressed disappointment at not being

aware that this visit was taking place. In replying, the Acting Superintendent stated that details

of the visit were leaked on social media and there was a need to rearrange the visit.

Reference was made to a number of other matters including anti social behaviour on the lead

up to Halloween, importance of cctv in the District, surge in domestic violence, use of

e-scooters on streets, drug detection rate, anti-social behaviour in housing estates and safety at

the Demesne.

advance of the Meeting.

involved in dealing with anti social behaviour in housing estates. He also stated that during

Halloween certain areas are targeted and the Gardaí will have more of a presence in these areas.

Detective Reidy also stated that areas where fireworks are sold are identified so that fireworks

are eliminated at source and not readily available.

overview of policing matters in the District.

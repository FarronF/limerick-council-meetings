**Item 7: AOB**

Question submitted by the PPN Linkage Group Facilitator Tracey McElligott, Sectorial

Representative, Community/Voluntary:

1. Discussion relating to right-sizing in terms of (1) reducing turn-around times and (2) ensuring the

household that is right-sizing has a quality home to move into.

In response to (1) Ms. Creed, Administrative Officer advised that future houses under the private

rightsizing scheme would be purchased under the SHIP acquisition stream, which has a target

refurbishment sunset clause of 6 months post sale completion.

Ms. Creed in response to (2) informed the group that the Private Rightsizing Scheme aims to ensure

that the household that is rightsizing has a quality home to move into. The pilot scheme at Mungret

Gate provided:

·Spacious 2 bed townhouses and 2 bed apartments above the required minimum floor area

standards

·A sustainable location between Raheen and Dooradoyle, 5km from Limerick City Centre, set in a

well-established and well-serviced area

·A benefit from countryside surroundings with plenty of activities nearby including a playground,

stunning scenery and 2km of walk and cycle paths

·Low maintenance finishes and a high A2 BER rating

·High quality external finishes and large private gardens approx. 5m x 9m long

·Wraparound management function with 24/7 telecare by Clann Housing – a dedicated age-friendly

housing AHB.

A discussion took place and the main points were:

-

Cllr. Sarah Kiely asked in relation to any of the new or proposed right sizing schemes if (1)

pets were not allowed and (2) what are the plans for the future in relation to this? Cllr. Kiely

stated that pets should be allowed in apartments and this would be an additional incentive

for people who wish to right-size.

Ms. Sarah Newell, Senior Executive Officer in response to (1) stated that it’s permissable to

have pets in townhouse accommodation. Ms. Newell advised that (2) Limerick City and

County Council can discuss with the Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) their policy regarding

pets.

-

Cllr. Sharon Benson asked if an invitation could be extended to Cena the traveller led

voluntary accommodation association to present on the work, they do with Travellers to

address critical accommodation needs.

Cllr. Sarah Kiely added it would be better to prioritise the larger AHB’s, add one or two per

SPC.

Ms. Curley stated it’s for members to decide but highlighted that there are 53 Approved

Housing Bodies actively working in Limerick and if the SPC were to invite every AHB to

present that this would take a number of years.

-

Cllr. Tom Collopy welcomed inviting the AHB’s as it would be a learning curve and education

for all Councillors.

Cllr. Sarah Kiely stated she would be of the opinion not to overload the SPC in relation to

routine operational matters regarding the delivery of services and to concentrate on the

important strategic tasks the SPC has as a committee of the council, to advise and assist the

Council in the formulation, development and review of policy.

Cllr. Sharon Benson also added that it's probably best to prioritise inviting the larger AHB’s in

the city at each SPC throughout the year.

**On the proposal of Cllr. Sharon Benson seconded by Cllr. Sarah Kiely, it was agreed that**

**“Cena, the Traveller led Voluntary Accommodation Association would be invited to present on the**

**work they do at the next SPC”**

**February SPC meeting date Wednesday, 15th** **February 2023.**

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary thanked everyone who attended the SPC and wished all a

Merry Christmas.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale -

Councillors B. Collins (Proposer), J. O’Donoghue, K. Sheahan, S. Keary, A.

Teskey

**We will move at the next Meeting that the tenants of Approved Housing Bodies be given**

**the same rights as local authority housing tenants in the option of purchasing their rented**

**home, should they wish to do so.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Collins (B).

The Members agreed that it was important that tenants across all social housing categories

be treated fairly and consistently. They agreed that most tenants do not understand what

was the difference in tenure type and what possible options were available to them re the

right to purchase, etc., so they agreed that it was important that there was consistency in

approach.

Members also noted concerns regarding the ongoing management of individual housing

associations due to the age profile of committees involved in their original set up, and who

would continue the management of same going forward.

**REPLY:**

If an Approved Housing Body (AHB) is in receipt of funding under a scheme

(e.g. CALF or CAS), they must comply with the terms and conditions of that

scheme. Under such schemes, the AHB is legally required to make the property

available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or leasing

agreement (e.g. 25 years).
---
17

Section 45 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009, does provide

for the sale by local authorities and AHBs of designated new houses to eligible

households and the associated Housing (Incremental Purchase) Regulations

2010 (S.I. 252 of 2010).

In addition, if a property is owned outright by an AHB and it is not subject to

public funding, the AHB may choose to sell that property, once this is allowed

for in their constitution.

However, it is our understanding that any sales would have to be initiated by

the AHB in question. There is no direction from the Department of Housing,

Local Government and Heritage to compel the AHB Sector to initiate the sale

of new houses.

Should this Notice of Motion be passed, we would recommend that we write

to the Minister to consider same and a copy of this Notice of Motion is

forwarded to the Housing Commission.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keary and adopted.

**43 of Bunreacht na hÉireann.**

At the request of Councillor Carey and with the agreement of the Meeting, this Motion

was withdrawn.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council write to the Minister**

**for Health asking that immediate access be granted to Kaftrio for the 35 children in Ireland**

**with Cystic Fibrosis excluded from accessing this drug.**

At the request of Councillor O’Sullivan and with the agreement of the Meeting, this

Notice of Motion was withdrawn. Councillor O’Sullivan welcomed the recent announcement

that the Minister for Health had agreed to the drug being provided.

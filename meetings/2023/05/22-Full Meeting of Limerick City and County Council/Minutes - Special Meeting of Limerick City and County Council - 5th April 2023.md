The Mayor welcomed all the Elected Members, Officials, members of the public and media

who were present in the Chamber and Online for the Meeting. He stated that he called the

Special Meeting to discuss the issue set out in the Agenda as follows:

“For the Forward Planning Section to commence a review of the Limerick

Development Plan 2022-2028 with a view to amending the terms of Objective SS 017

– Rural Areas under Strong Urban Influence, to allow residents of Tier 4 Settlements

build in the rural countryside without the current constraints”.

The Elected Members thanked the Mayor for calling this Special Meeting and in doing so,

they highlighted the difficulty for residents living in Tier 4 settlements that are looking to

build in rural areas, and outlined the need to commence a review of the Limerick

Development Plan. Members noted the seriousness of the situation and it was the view of

some Members that this motion should be amended to include those living in Tier 3 areas,

also.

Due to disruption in the Chamber while discussing this motion, the Mayor adjourned the

meeting for 10 minutes. After reconvening the Meeting, the Mayor considered that the---
meeting, owing to disorder, could not continue, and in line with Standing Orders adjourned

the meeting until such time as the Mayor shall decide.

This concluded the meeting

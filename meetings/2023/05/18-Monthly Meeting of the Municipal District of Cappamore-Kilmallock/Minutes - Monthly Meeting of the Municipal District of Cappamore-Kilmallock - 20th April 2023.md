NOTICES OF MOTION

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that new fit

for purpose legislation is introduced and enacted relating to dogs entering on lands and said

premises of owners which may cause injury to persons or animals, to prevent distress to

farmers, owners, and their animals and to counteract dog fouling. This legislation should

include the appointment of sufficient dog wardens to monitor, enforce and follow up on

reports.

**Reply:**

Should this be agreed by the Elected Members of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal

District, this Notice of Motion will be brought to the Plenary Meeting of Limerick City and

County Council for consideration.

**Proposed and Seconded Unanimously**

***This Notice of Motion will be forwarded for consideration to the Plenary Council by all***

***Elected Members.***

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that a

suitable location be found and possible funding avenues identified for a public toilet in

Bruff, possibly on Crawford St.

**Reply:**

The current cost of installation and maintaining an automated public toilet facility is in the

order of €40,000 per annum. The cost of such a facility would have to be sourced via the

existing Council budget and if approved would result in funding being reallocated from

other essential Council services such as the maintenance of roads, housing, parks, etc.
---
***A discussion took place on the costs associated with providing and operating/maintaining***

***a public toilet. A query was raised as to whether a pilot scheme could be used to introduce***

***a charge for using the public toilet in Kilmallock. This Notice of Motion was taken as read.***

9. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Teefy

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that Road

Stud delineators “Cats eyes” be put in place on the Regional Roads in the areas where they

are not already in place. They are very effective and are a safety measure on the roads.

**Reply:**

The Cappamore Kilmallock MD has commenced a programme of installing road studs on all

regional roads using a portion of the General Maintenance Safety Budget. This is a limited

budget and therefore the installation of road studs across the regional road network will be

done on a phased basis over the coming years.

**Proposed: Councillor Teefy**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

QUESTIONS

choice is 58. Of these 58 qualified applicants, there are 19 HAP accommodated and in

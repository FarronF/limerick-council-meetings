QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

| will ask at the next Meeting for the installation of at least three ramps or raised
platforms for Arraview Estate, Newcastle West. The Residents Association have
contacted me and allayed concern with regards the volume of speeding cars in the
estate, which is very dangerous.

| will ask at the next Meeting for safety measures to be installed at the Glebe Estate
in Monagea. Several surveys have been carried out at this location. This has been
previously discussed with the conclusion that there would be a narrowing of the
roadway at the entrance to the estate.

| will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to explore options for extra parking in
Newcastle West town. Due to increase in business footfall and increase in
population over the past few years we need more options for parking.

Questions submitted by Councillor J. Scanian

| will ask at the next Meeting when protective measures will be but in place at the
junction of the Old Camas Road with the Ballyowen Road at Clounscherick.

I will ask at the next Meeting when speed indicators will be put in place on (i) The
Southern approach to Feohanagh Village (ii) The Ballymackessy approach to
Knockane Road, Newcastle West.

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on car parking arrangements to
complement our Greenway facilities at Newcastle West.

Questions submitted by Councillor M. Collins

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the feasibility study for a new
playground at The Demesne, Newcastle West.

I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will pipe the
stream and replace the dangerous and broken down railing at Glenmore, Strand in
the interest of safety.

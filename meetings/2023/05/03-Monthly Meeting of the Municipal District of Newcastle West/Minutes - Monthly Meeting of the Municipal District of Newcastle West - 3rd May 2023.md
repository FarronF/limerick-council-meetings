Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next*** ***Meeting*** **for an update on the following:**

**(a)** **Devon Road Cross**

**(b)** **Dore's Cross, Templeglantine**

**(c)Footpath extension out the Killarney Road to** **Dalton’s Cross.**

REPLY:

**(a)**In 2021, the Mid West National Road Design Office submitted a feasibility report to TII

recommending a staggered junction be constructed at N21 Devon Cross, to replace the

existing arrangement. Having considered this request, TII declined to proceed with the

detail design process, and they did not allocate the necessary funding to implement the

recommended option. As an improvement measure, signage was installed on the R515 in

2021, reinforcing the presence of the junction to traffic approaching the N21 on the R515.

**(b)**Limerick City and County Council have recently undertaken a turning count survey on

Dore’s Cross and are currently developing a feasibility report for submission to TII. This

feasibility report will look at a number of potential improvements at the junction and aim
---

to identify a preferred option. Assuming this report is accepted by TII, we will then

proceed with developing a preliminary design report which will also need to go through

the TII gateways prior to funding being committed to by TII for any proposed

improvements.

Limerick City and County Council will provide an update once the feasibility report has

been submitted.

**(c)** At present, footpath works that only require maintenance qualify for inclusion for funding

under TII GEO Apps.

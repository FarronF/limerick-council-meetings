**5.Economic Development and Enterprise Directorate**

**Draft Castleconnell Local Area Plan 2023 -2029**

Circulated, Report of the A/Director of Services, Economic Development and Enterprise dated 23rd

March, 2023 and Chief Executive’s Report dated 23rd March, 2023 on the submissions received on

the Material Alterations to the Draft Castleconnell Local Area Plan 2023 -2029, for consideration by

Members.

Proposed by Councillor Kiely;

Seconded by Councillor Pond;

And Resolved;

“That the Draft Castleconnell Local Area Plan 2023 – 2029 be made, in accordance with the Draft

Plan published on 1st October, 2022, the Proposed Material Alterations published on 28th January,

2023 and the alterations outlined in the Chief Executive’s Report dated 23rd March, 2023, under

Section 20 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended)”.

**QUESTIONS**

**6.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to advise members on the***

***scheme in existence to allow businesses maintain strategic roundabouts across the city and how***

***often the business sponsors replant and maintain them.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council seek expressions of interest from businesses and

organisations who wish to sponsor biodiversity-friendly roundabouts in the city and county

of Limerick. The Council want to hear from businesses and organisations who wish to

enhance the local environment while benefiting from the advertising opportunities that are

being offered. The scheme shall provide businesses and organisations an excellent
---
7

opportunity to promote themselves through their association with the landscaping and

maintenance of roundabouts.

The sponsoring company will be responsible for having a biodiversity friendly design created

for their roundabout of choice. This design will need to be approved by Limerick City and

County Council before any agreement for sponsorship can be entered into. The company

shall then be responsible for obtaining the services of a landscape contractor to implement

and maintain their design. These designs should reflect the character of their settings, with

the more rural roundabouts incorporating wildflowers and native species, while more

formal designs, based on pollinator friendly perennials, are encouraged for the roundabouts

in more urban locations.

The sponsorship period will be for a duration of 3 years, commencing on completion of the

planting. Subject to satisfactory maintenance of the roundabout(s), the Council may, at its

discretion, extend the sponsorship for a specified period. Each applicant can tender for one

of more roundabouts. Joint applications will also be accepted where a maximum of two

businesses or organisations wish to sponsor a roundabout jointly.  The sponsors will be

responsible for implementation of the initial landscaping works and the ongoing

maintenance thereafter for a period of 3 years. The sponsor will be required to engage the

services of a suitably experienced and competent landscape contractor who will be required

to adhere to the appropriate Health & Safety requirements for working in a live traffic

environment.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many houses have the***

***Council purchased under the 'tenant in situ' scheme and how many, based on applications, do***

***the Council expect to purchase.***

**REPLY:** 12 properties have been acquired under the ‘tenant in situ’ scheme with a further 18

properties at sale agreed status.

We have 262 number of units on our central Notice to Quit register as at 14th April 2023.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many houses have***

***been provided by developers under the social and affordable obligations in housing schemes***

***completed in the last two years and to list the number of houses per housing scheme.***

**REPLY**: 74 Part V units have been completed in the last two years (2021 and 2022) over 16 housing

sites. All of these sites have 10% of the overall granted number of units as a requirement to

deliver Part V social housing. The recent new legal provisions for the delivery of Part V

affordable housing have not seen any completions of units yet. The number of units and the

relevant housing scheme details are documented below:

For part of 2021, private residential development sites were affected by the Government’s

shutdown in construction activity as part of the national effort to halt the spread of COVID-

19. This affected the outturn of Part V units for that year.

The Council are currently forecasting 634 Part V homes to be delivered based on signed

agreements to date. However, Part V delivery is fully reliant on private sector delivery and

the developer being able to have the capacity and funds to start on site. Any downturn in

the private market will reduce the supply of Part V homes therefore.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what steps is the Council***

***taking to ensure to expand its existing “tenant-in-situ” scheme to ensure that renters in receipt***

***of HAP or RAS aren’t made homeless due to the sale of the property including what extra***

***resources (e.g. manpower and budgetary) is the Council devoting to ensure this.***

**REPLY**: Where Limerick City and County Council is made aware of a household who may have

received a Notice to Quit we will assess the household’s current circumstances, assess the

availability of social housing properties and allocate a social housing tenancy, if

appropriate.

In some cases, Limerick City and County Council will assess if there is potential to purchase

the house where a HAP/RAS tenant resides and will enquire if the landlord is willing to sell

to Limerick City and County Council. If the landlord is willing, the Council will ensure the

current house is suitable for the household in terms of size and condition. The Council will

also ensure the house value is within an independent market valuation range, which is a
---
9

requirement to draw down purchase monies from the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage.

If the individual/household has the means to potentially purchase the property, and the

owner is willing to sell to the household, the Council can advise the household of the

availability of the Local Authority Home Loan.

Where no suitable accommodation can be identified or it is not appropriate for the local

authority to acquire the property, a household may be accommodated through emergency

accommodation.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has provided an initial

allocation of 75 for the number of acquisitions that can be funded in 2023. We have 262

number of units on our central Notice to Quit register as at 14th April. 2023 We have written

to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage seeking additional

resources, both administrative and technical.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what steps is the Council***

***taking to ensure implementation of the new “cost rental backstop” whereby the Council or an***

***Approved Housing Body (AHB) will purchase the home of renters who are not in receipt of HAP***

***or RAS but who are facing homelessness due to the sale of the property including what extra***

***resources (e.g. manpower and budgetary) is the Council devoting to ensure this.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and Council will carry out an initial assessment for risk of homelessness and

where applicable refer to the Housing Agency who may be able to complete a Cost Rental

Tenant in Situ acquisition. Following referral by the Council, the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ

process is managed entirely by the Housing Agency.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on when***

***works will commence on the Mill Road Active Travel Scheme and for a detailed update on the***

***progress of the scheme.***

**REPLY**: Active Travel anticipate tendering for Works Contractor in mid May 2023 with anticipated

construction duration of 18 months.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if any discussions have taken***

***place between the Council and the LEDP about the possibility of acquiring the Market’s Field.***

**REPLY:** The Council has had preliminary discussions with the Limerick Enterprise Development

Partnership (LEDP) in relation to the future of the Market’s Field. There is no outcome to

these discussions at this point but engagement will continue with relevant stakeholders.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**
---
10

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, further to my motion at***

***the December Metropolitan Meeting for an update on the engagement between the Council and***

***Limerick 2030 DAC and the Housing Department on a proposed feasibility study on the future use***

***of the former Cray Lane (Gaelscoil Sairséal) building.***

**14.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to Council***

***Rents/HAP when there is budget increases in social welfare payments, can the Council make***

***contact with people paying rent/HAP etc. to the Council advising them that they have to make***

***the Council aware of any increases in their payments as people do not realise they need to inform***

***the Council as their rent will increase, resulting in arrears often dating back a couple of years.***

**REPLY:** All tenants that are subject to the Differential Rent Scheme, be they occupants of Council

houses or in privately-owned accommodation and in receipt of social housing support

through HAP/RAS schemes, are advised in advance of signing letting agreements or

contracts that the onus lies with them to advise the Council immediately of any changes in

household income, either upwards or downwards, so that their weekly rent can be re-

calculated accordingly. This is also a specific condition of their contracts. There are 5,549

Council tenancies, 2196 HAP tenancies, and 1236 RAS tenancies. It would be impractical

and a significant administrative burden to write to almost 9000 households each time that

an increase in general social welfare rates is awarded. Furthermore, all Council tenants

receive quarterly statements and the following advice is included at the head of such

statements: “It is your responsibility to advise this office if you have had any change to your

household income or household make up.”

Generally speaking, the normal across the board increase in social welfare rates does not

give rise to an immediate review of rent payable, as the amount involved would have a

minimal material effect on the amount due. However, when other changes come to light,

such as employment, change of payment type, additional social welfare payment etc., the

correct rates of social welfare for the applicable dates are taken into account in calculating

the extent of arrears due.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick:***

***(a)**How many applications for the following grants have been received since the beginning of***

***2023:***

***1.**Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability.***

***2.**Mobility Aids Grant.***

***3.**Housing Aid for Older People Grant.***

***(b)**How many of these applications have been processed.***

***(c)**How many applicants have been notified of their application being received?***

**REPLY:** (a) How many applications for the following grants have been received since the beginning

of 2023: **266**

1. Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability- **98**

2. Mobility Aids Grant- **27**
---
11

3. Housing Aid for Older People Grant- **141**

(b) How many of these applications have been processed**- 67**

(c) How many applicants have been notified of their application being received-**174**

Please note the balance of applications have been checked and verified and applicants will

be notified once we receive notification of our 2023 allocation from the Department.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if**consultants have been***

***appointed yet for the design of the connector road linking Groody Road to Golf Links Road and if***

***the Council can provide an update on this project.***

**REPLY:** MHL Consultants have been appointed on this scheme and the scheme has developed

through NTA Phase 1 - Scope & Purpose & Phase 2 - Concept Development approval. The

Options report was approved by the NTA in November 2022.

A Natura Impact Statement is being prepared for inclusion with a planning application to

An Bord Pleanála. Active Travel expects to lodge the planning application and associated

CPO documentation with An Bord Pleanála (ABP) in Q2 2023.

The approval of a scheme by ABP is not within the control of the Council and accordingly it

is difficult to determine a decision date and if any planning conditions that may impact on

detailed design development may be conditioned. But the following is the current best

estimate:

Planning & CPO approval:

Q1 2024

Tender for Construction:

Q2 2024

Anticipate Construction Commencement:  Q3 2024

*(note that there is significant amount of fill material requirement, which is weather*

*dependent task and could result in delay of start date.)*

Anticipate Construction Completion:

Q3 2025

**17.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the water***

***testing that has commenced at the Loughmore Canal with details from the water tested so far.***

**REPLY**: An investigation into the water quality in the Loughmore Canal is ongoing.  As part of this

investigation, a sampling programme was initiated on the 7th March 2023 in order to

monitor water quality. This project entails a sample being taken once a month at random

times/dates within the month at the storm discharge point to the Loughmore Canal.  The

Samples will then be tested and compared with the Surface water  standards that are

presently in place in Ireland and are contain in the ‘European Communities Environmental

Objectives (Surface Water) Regulations 2009 – S.I. No. 272 of 2009, as amended’.

The analysis from the first round of sampling has indicated an exceedance in Total

Phosphorus and is consistent with our investigation findings to date. The second round of

sampling for April will happen over the next few days.
---
12

Please also note that a sample was taken on the 30th November 2022 and no exceedances

were identified.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if Limerick Council applied***

***for the additional funding made available to local authorities for additional staff to tackle***

***dereliction, and if not, why not.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council has been extremely proactive and successful in activating

vacant and derelict properties in the town and village settlements and the city district. A

full dedicated unit is in place to engage with owners of derelict sites, vacant sites, and vacant

homes, and has been resourced by the Council.

The Vacant Homes Officer is a funded position through the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage since 2018. With the addition of the Croi Conaithe (Towns) Fund

in 2022, an additional administrative staff members has been funded through the scheme

to support the return of vacant and derelict property back into residential use.

A third round of funding, to the value of €150 million nationally, was announced in January

2023 under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF). Limerick City and

County Council has made an application for funding under this project. This support will

address long-term vacancy and dereliction with an objective to accelerate the provision of

residential accommodation, with a possibility of tackling some multi use (part residential /

part commercial) projects in the Metropolitan area.

It is hoped that consideration will be given for additional staff resourcing as part of this

application.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of Metropolitan District of Limerick for the number of animal***

***welfare complaints that have been logged in the Metropolitan District over the last two years.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council has no authority to enforce the Animal, Health & Welfare

Act 2013. Animal welfare is not a primary service of the Council, therefore we do not accept

animal welfare complaints. Complainants are advised to contact An Garda Síochána or The

Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine, who are authorised under the Animal,

Health and Welfare Act 2013.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***completion of the City Centre Traffic Management Plan for which the NTA have committed***

***funding for since 2020.***

**REPLY**: Preliminary work has been carried out on a Limerick City Traffic Management Plan but this

work is still in its early stages.  It could not be completed until the Transport Strategy

(LSMATS) was finalised at the end of 2022 and Limerick BusConnects was sufficiently

advanced to identify with confidence the displacement/diversion options for traffic.  The

first public consultation on BusConnects has just finished and the selected routes for bus

provision will be finalised in the coming months.

The NTA has then committed to leading a Transport Plan for the city centre.  The Transport

Plan will identify the optimal displacement/diversion routes for traffic, as well as related

supporting measures.  The Transport Plan will also incorporate a Delivery Plan for the city,

which will consider business requirements in a sustainable manner. It is expected that the

city centre Transport Plan will be significantly advanced in the current year but is likely to

extend into 2024 for substantive completion.

**23.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the work***

***Limerick City and County Council have carried out in relation to the provision of affordable***

**24.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***masterplan for traffic management on the Singland Road, Bloodmill Road given the increasing***

***population with new housing developments and traffic volumes. With special emphasis on***

***Castletroy View and the needs of residents exiting the estate and the problems it poses. A***

***commitment had been given previously and no update has been forthcoming.***

**REPLY**: In the draft Limerick BusConnects proposals, Old Singland/Bloodmill Road has been

identified as a priority bus corridor.  The first public consultation on BusConnects has just

finished and a decision on the final selected bus corridors will follow.  Assuming this road is

confirmed as a priority bus corridor at that stage, the NTA will develop a scheme to upgrade

the infrastructure to accommodate increased active and public transport requirements in

this area. The scheme will incorporate an appropriate traffic management plan for the

Castletroy View estate and other housing developments in the area. The existing traffic

movements in the vicinity will continue to be monitored by the Council and interim

measures put in place if deemed necessary.  However, it should be noted that some peak

time delays for traffic accessing busy urban roads are to be expected.

Note that preliminary design work has already commenced in improving the lower section

of Bloodmill Road (realigned culvert section) to accommodate increased sustainable travel

usage.

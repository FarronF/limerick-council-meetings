At the outset of the Meeting the Meetings Administrator invited those present to notify

any declaration of interest in any item due for discussion at the Meeting. No such interests

were declared.

The following issues were raised by Members, prior to the adoption of the Minutes with

the consent of the Cathaoirleach.

Councillor Sheahan referred to an item he raised on the sale of houses in Rathkeale, which

had been discussed at a private workshop, however he felt as there were no minutes to

reflect the discussion that took place in this forum and requested the item be revisited

and discussed at a public meeting. Councillor Teskey agreed with these sentiments stating

there are no records kept of decisions made at private meetings and requested that all

meetings should be held publically going forward.

Councillor Sheahan proposed to call on the Mayor to convene a Special Meeting of the

Full Council to discuss Planning issues in relation to rural Ireland. This was seconded by

Councillor Teskey and agreed. Councillor Teskey added the Minister for the Department

of Environment, Heritage and Local Government as well as the Planning Regulator should

also be in attendance at this Special Meeting.

Councillor O’Brien proposed we correspond with the Editor of the Limerick Post

newspaper that Journalist Alan Jacques be invited to attend future meetings of the Adare-

Rathkeale Municipal District. This was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue.

Following discussion between Members the proposal was put to a vote. The results of

the voting was as follows:

**Against the proposal:**

Councillor Sheahan

The Meetings Administrator declared the proposal agreed.

Councillor Teskey referred to a Motion passed recently at the Full Council Meeting for the

proposal to use the Bank of Ireland premises in Askeaton as a facility to house 22 no.

Ukrainian refugees. Councillor Teskey felt the money to transfer the bank premises to

temporary housing units would be better spent on bringing derelict properties in the

District back into housing stock and the bank be left as a community building. Councillor

Sheahan proposed Members support him to have the library in Askeaton upgraded and

transferred to part of the bank building. This was seconded by Councillor Teskey and

agreed.

**Deputation from Kilteery Pier Group**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Kilteery Pier Group to the Meeting.

Meeting and also thanked Limerick City and County Council for the considerable

improvements they have made to Kilteery Pier to date. He proceeded to outline the main

areas which need further enhancement at the pier and its environs.

These include:

1. Safety measures at the junction entrance road off the N69.

2. Relocation of the barrier from the entrance of the pier to the entrance from the

N69.

3. Create more laybys to enable the traffic flow more easily and make it safer for

motorists.

4. The removal of an embankment at the entrance to the pier.

5. Inspection of the eroding road surface near the barrier due to tidal flooding.

6. The erection of dog foul bins at the pier.

7. As the Lifeguard hut is only available during the Summer months could changing

facilities be provided at the pier for members who swim all year round, similar to

facilities at Glin Pier.

The Cathaoirleach thanked the Deputation for their presentation and advised a response

to their request would be provided in due course. The Deputation then withdrew from

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**7.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council start the process**

**of linking Croom National School to the distributor road at the rear of the school.**

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor

Sheahan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Donoghue referred to the huge investment in

excess of €2.5 million provided for the upgrade of the school, however, vehicle access is

limited and advised the landowner has agreed to provide the land to make the

connection.

**Reply:**

The applicant has yet to identify the footprint, and associated landholdings

involved, for a potential link at the rear of the National School to the

existing distributor road.

In principle, the Council favours the development of such an access. In

order to progress the planning process for the new school access,

permission will be required from the landowners involved.

The Department of Transport has indicated that they are not in a position

to fund any further sections of the distributor road.

As the link to the school is to facilitate school development, the applicant

should make an approach to the Department of Education to fund/part

fund the road construction.

The Council will also seek a funding contribution from the National

Transport Authority under the Safe Routes to School programme.

Once the above funding possibilities have been investigated, the Council

will then review the matter.

Note the indicative cost of building a road of this nature is on the order of

€1m per 200m length. (Exact length required for the new connection to the

National School is to be identified by the applicant.)

The members requested that the Council investigate further the possible funding streams

for this project.

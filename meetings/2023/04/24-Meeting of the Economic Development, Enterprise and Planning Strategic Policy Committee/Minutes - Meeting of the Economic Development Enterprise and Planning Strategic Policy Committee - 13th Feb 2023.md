While the motion was broadly welcomed, Councillors urged caution on the introduction of

additional development levies in the future to fund a compensation scheme.

Councillor Kiely reworded the proposal:

The motion wasproposed by Cllr Sasa Novak Uí Chonchúir and seconded by Cllr Olivia O’Sullivan

Street project and the delays which ensued.

Councillor S. Keary proposed that:

**Item 4**

**Update on Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) by Eileen Humphreys, Administrative**

**Officer Urban & Rural Community Development**

Ms Humphreys gave a presentation and stated that the purpose of the LECP, as provided for in the

Local Government Reform Act 2014, is to set out a six-year plan detailing the objectives and actions

needed to promote and support the economic development and the local and community

development of the relevant Local Authority area.

Ms Humphreys stated that the LECP process is currently at the beginning of stage 1, “Preparation by

Advisory Group”, at which stage sign off by SPC and LCDC members is required.

On the proposal of Councillor S. Keary, seconded by Councillor J. Pond, it was unanimously agreed

that the draft LECP framework proceed to the next stage - “Public Consultation”.

**Item 5**

**Presentation from Simply Blue Group on Renewable Energy by Marie Gleeson, External Affairs &**

**Stakeholder Liaison and Brian Fitzgerald, Director of External Affairs.**

Simply Blue are a Cork headquartered company focused on replacing fossil fuels with clean ocean

energy and developing sustainable sources of energy. Their business is focused on four key markets;

Floating wind, e-Fuels, Wave Energy and Aquaculture

The company currently have projects operating in Ireland, Spain, Norway, the UK and the US

Ms Gleeson explained to members that they are in the early stages of developing the “Western Star”

project off the west coast of Co Clare, which will consist of a floating windfarm.

The proposed Western Star Project will be located at least 35km from the shoreline. The innovative

floating technology proposed for this project will allow the turbines to be located far from shore and

in waters over 100m deep, where traditional fixed bottom turbine foundations would be

uneconomical.
---
Ms Gleeson outlined the economic opportunity, which this project presents, and the job and supply

chain potential, which will come with it. She concluded that if the region wants to maximise the

opportunity which this project presents, then we have to be able to unlock it.

Members queried the costs associated with this project and which government department deals

with licencing applications. Mr Fitzgerald explained that a new authority has been formed called

MARA (Maritime Area Regulatory Authority), however it is under resourced, predominantly because

of a lack of skilled resource in this field. He said a “crisis response” to the resourcing of MARA is

what is required from government.

Members thanked Ms Gleeson for her presentation and offered to help with the unlocking of the

opportunity and to give their support where possible. They requested that Simply Blue Group write

a letter to the members of this SPC to outline what they could do in that regard.

On the proposal of Cllr. Galvin, seconded by Cllr. O’Sullivan, it was unanimously agreed to suspend

Standing Orders in order to allow the completion of the meeting and members of the full council

attend the section dealing with ‘taking in charge of private residential extates’.

**Item 6**

**Briefing on Protocol for Taking in Charge of Private Residential Estates. Presented by Nuala**

**O’Connell, Planning Environment & Place-Making**

Ms O’Connell’s presentation outlined Limerick City and County Council’s protocol in relation to

Taking in Charge (TIC) of private housing developments under Section 11 of the Roads Act 1993.

Where pre-planning meetings are held, the applicants are requested to outline the area to be taken

in charge on a site layout map to be submitted with the planning application.

Ms O’Connell informed members that her department are in the process of compiling a multi annual

programme for taking in charge. This will feed into a prioritisation list of developments, which will

be taken in charge over a multi annual period. Elected representatives will be briefed on a biannual

basis on progress of this programme, through municipal district meetings.

**Item 7**

**Any Other Business**

No other issues were raised.

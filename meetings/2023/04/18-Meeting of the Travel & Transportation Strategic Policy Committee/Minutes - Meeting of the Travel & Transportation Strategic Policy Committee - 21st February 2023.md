**Item 3: - Park and Ride**

Ms. N. McGarry delivered a presentation on Park and Ride. The members thanked Ms. McGarry

and the Chair opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Leddin stated that Park and Ride is a key piece of infrastructure and it is very important that

sites are identified. He added that Limerick is a growing city and an increase in staff in the Raheen

Business Park will demand an efficient Park and Ride infrastructure with a bus service every 5

minutes.

Cllr. McSweeney agreed with Cllr. Leddin and referred to the Park and Ride at the Red Cow. He

asked if there was a timeline and if there are any issues with zoning in relation to the high-tech

companies in Raheen Business Park.

Mr. Kennedy confirmed that BusConnects was going to public consultation and will be launched

tomorrow, the 22nd February in Limerick. He added that this is a very important step and the

Executive is also working with the NTA to identify sites. With regard to the timeline, the NTA is

hoping to progress and it is one of their key projects. Lands at Raheen Business Park are zoned

high-tech/manufacturing in the Limerick Development Plan 2022 – 2028. With regard to

Castletroy, Junction 28 will have to go through the planning process. The NTA wants to advance

the scheme and is a very positive step.

Cllr. Secas stated that for Park & Ride to work a holistic approach is required. She referred to

Park & Ride at the University Hospital which is not efficient. Staff have to wait for a shuttle bus

in the evenings and are stuck in traffic. She suggested that infrastructure needs to be in place like

bike facilities etc.

Mr. Gallagher stated that Park & Ride will be very important in Limerick but only if people have

confidence in it. BusConnects will propose higher frequency for bus routes. The 304 service from

Raheen to UL operating at 15minute intervals is very successful in the current climate. By the

time this is approved and in place, the infrastructure will be improved. LSMATS says future Road

Park and Ride will take account of dual rail and bus travel in future. In relation to a holistic

approach, he added that there is an alternative, there is a dockless bike system in place in the

Castletroy area and there will be various different models in the coming years.

Cllr. Teefy asked if Park & Ride is identified in Ballysimon and what is the timeframe. She added

that there is large volume of traffic on the N24 and R512.---

Mr. Kennedy confirmed that Ballysimon is identified in the Transport Strategy. As there is a train

station in the area, Irish Rail is looking at dual tracking from Limerick junction to Colbert station.

As an environmental assessment and design is required, there is currently no timeframe but the

NTA is looking at different sites. Mr. Gallagher added that the rail at Ballysimon has been

identified as one of the short-term aspects, therefore will not take long.

Cllr. Leddin queried the timeframe and asked if sites are state owned or will CPO be required.

Mr. Kennedy advised that the sites are in private ownership and a funding model will have to be

identified.

The Chair recognised that it is a complex process and asked about the train station in Moyross

and if there is a proposal to do Park & Ride there. Mr. Gallagher advised that there are constraints

in the Moyross site but main parking is at the Coonagh site. Mr. Gallagher confirmed that Road

Park & Ride is being examined in that area and in vicinity of Coonagh. Its aim will be to develop

and serve the community. The Chair added that it might make it more viable if we look at

alternatives.

**Item 3: - Dockless and TFI Bike Schemes**

Ms. K. McDonnell delivered a presentation on Dockless and TFI Bike Schemes. The members

thanked Ms. McDonnell and the Chair opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. O’Donovan observed that TFI station maintenance in Limerick is very poor and unreliable;

and this should be communicated back to TFI Bikes**.** She added that it is positive that there is a

new campus on Sarsfield Street, however the closest site is on Henry Street, which is unsafe and

can be dangerous to park. She suggested relocating to the city campus. She added that Dockless

Bike going ahead is positive but disappointing that it is a pilot in Castletroy. It would run a lot

better in the city and the nature of city living would benefit. She added that €5 fee is excessive

for a student. She raised two questions as follows:

1. What is the outcome of the pilot

2. Will we see Dockless scheme in city

The Chair added that it is great to see the pilot and see students using them. She agreed in

relation to the €5 fee and that it is too high for a student and referenced an annual charge of €3

in Europe.

Mr. Harper was pleased that TFI Bike Scheme is going to UL. He raised concerns regarding the

€5 fee and suggested the need to put in extra bike stands as they can fill up.---

Ms. McDonnell advised that it is intended to extend to the city centre with agreement with the

NTA. The pricing is an indicative price ‘pay as you go’ price and there will be subsidies available

for students. It is usually €1 to unlock and a fee per minute. In relation to parking for dockless

bikes, the team is currently looking at key locations, Castletroy, Annacotty, NTP, shopping centres

& playgrounds.

**Item 3: - Safe Routes to School Programme**

Ms. K. McDonnell delivered a presentation on Safe Routes to School. The Chair opened the floor

to questions.

Cllr. Leddin acknowledged the work by Ms. McDonnell and team. He raised concerns of the

proximity of S.C.R. scheme to local schools.

Cllr. Teefy was pleased to see schools included in her area. She advised that there are a lot of

new footpaths in Caherconlish and hopes this will continue. She added that Hospital secondary

school has 1,200 students and traffic is very congested and some could walk to school if

infrastructure was in place. She asked about the timeline.

The Chair complimented the excellent work and added it is life-changing for children. 37 schools

showed expressions of interest and 8 schools selected in Round 1 with 5 more now added is very

positive. She would like to see it expand and asked if scheme is going to re-open.

In response to Cllr. Leddin regarding S.C.R., Mr. Gallagher advised that is will have to be re-

examined. Regarding timeline, Ms. McDonnell advised that there will be consultation in the late

spring with schools and parents.

In response to the Chair, Ms. McDonnell advised that it is anticipated that Round 3 will be

announced in the autumn nationally. She added that the SRTS has advised that they will not be

reopening for new applications in the short term.

**Item 3: - EV Strategy**

Mr. John O’Leary delivered a presentation on EV Strategy. The members welcomed the strategy

and thanked Mr. O’Leary.

Cllr. Teefy was very pleased to see extra charging points in the county and city area and 4 in her

area. Mr. O’Leary added that the draft EV Strategy is to be issued for consideration during Q1

2023 and the final strategy is expected Q2 2023. An implementation plan will follow on from this.---

It was agreed to circulate the presentations as requested by Cllr. Secas.

The Chair asked if the stations listed in the presentation are part of the national strategy. Mr.

O’Leary advised that the sites listed are part of the pilot project. He added that civil works

(ducting and cabling) will commence in the coming weeks and it is intended to be completed by

the end of the summer. It is then intended to procure and appoint an operator by end of the

year.

**Item 3: - Bike Week**

Ms. K. McDonnell delivered a presentation on Bike Week 2023, which will run from Saturday 13th

to Sunday 21st May.

Cllr. Teefy asked who can apply and will there be notification of grants. Ms. McDonnell advised

that it will be advertised on the LCCC website and is open to community groups. Ms. McDonnell

confirmed that it is usually €500 per group with a guideline of €10 per person participating in the

event.

Mr. Harper asked how the grant process works and if funding can be obtained ahead of event.

In response Ms. McDonnell confirmed that receipts need to be submitted before funding can be

processed.

**Wayfinding Project**

Mr. Shane Farrell delivered a presentation on the Wayfinding Project.

The Chair welcomed the Place Making & Public Realm team to the meeting. She asked about

future proofing of project from 2 aspects –

1. Marketing campaign – will signage be dated in future years

2. As there is more and more information on line are we cluttering our outdoor areas with

signage.

Mr. Harper asked that when decluttering of signs commences, if tree cages can also be

examined. Cllr. Secas commended the work on this project from an aesthetics point of view.

In response to the Chair Mr. Farrell advised that certain future proofing can be built into signs as

the city changes. Signs can be easily printed and updated. The green branding sign of Limerick

has a right to stand as sculpture and is attractive. Mr. Hanrahan advised that the brand should

have longevity and referenced the recent branding of Adare, which is built into the County & City

Development Plan. Mr. Farrell also added that tree cages will be examined.---

**Item 4: Review of Budget Allocations for 2023:**

Ms. N. McGarry delivered a presentation on Budget Allocations for 2023 from the Department of

Transport, the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

Mr. Harper welcomed the grant allocations. He referred to a previous SPC meeting at which it

was agreed to circulate a detailed list of Active Travel schemes showing progress and completion

date.Mr. Kennedy agreed that an update will be circulated to all members by email.

Mr. O’Shea asked if there was an update on the Traffic Management Plan and a timeline for the

works at the Mackey Roundabout.

Mr. Kennedy confirmed that the Transport Plan will run in parallel with BusConnects, which will

be launched tomorrow, the 22nd February. Once the routes are approved as part of BusConnects,

the Transport Plan will follow.

In regard to Junction 28, €50k was the allocation for this year. It is hoped to appoint consultants

this year to advance design. There is a lot of work to be done and the crossing of the Mulcair will

require an EIAR. A timeline is not currently available.

Cllr. Teefy enquired about the local and regional roads allocation for the county compared to last

year. Mr. Kennedy advised that the DoT allocation is similar to last year and confirmed that

Municipal meetings will be scheduled over the next month or so. He advised that the NTA

committed to a number of Active Travel schemes in excess of €900k in each district and the

Directorate will continue to work with the NTA during the year.

The Chair thanked the presenters and members for their contribution. The meeting then

concluded.---

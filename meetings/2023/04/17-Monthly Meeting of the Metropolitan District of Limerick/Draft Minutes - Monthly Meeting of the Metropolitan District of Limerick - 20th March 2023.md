**QUESTIONS**

**6.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council would***

***plaques.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Road’s Department has consulted with the Council’s

Conservation Officer on this query, who has advised that it is not standard normal practise

to clean historical plaques on bridges or monuments. In some cases, there may be a

separate plaque with an inscription located adjacent to the monument that is legible for

the public to read which can be easily maintained and cleaned when required. Each

monument is dealt on a case-by-case basis and any request to upgrade or clean is reviewed

with the Council’s Conservation Officer. A funding source such as a conservation grant

would also need to be determined before any specialist monument upgrade or cleaning

works can take place.

***and resources is being allocated to street cleansing division to ensure streets, residential estates***

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**13.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council change their policy when it comes to payment of grants such as Housing***

***Adaptation grants for people with a disability, Housing Aid for Older People and Mobility Aids***

***Grants and instead of lodging the grant that has been approved to the applicants bank account***

***the grant should be paid directly to the contractor bank account who has completed the job.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted the difficulties for builders, in particular

small contractors, when payments were not received.

**REPLY**:

 The Housing Adaptation Grant for Persons with a Disability, Housing Aid for Older People

and the Mobility Aid Grants are grants which are available to private householders. The

housing aid grants are works carried out to private houses, where the householder &

approved grant applicant engages directly with the contractor. The Council administers

the scheme and approves an applicant for a grant but does not recommend or engage

contractors to carry out works to the approved applicant’s property, as this is the

responsibility of the householder.

 Once an applicant is approved for a grant, it is the decision of the householder to engage

a contractor to carry out the works. Applicants are advised at the time of approval that

payment of the grant will be made directly to them. If there are future issues with

workmanship or payment queries this is between the contractor and the applicant and

Limerick City and County Council has no liability.

 Under the Revenue Guidance Notes for Government Payments, Local Authorities are

required to file an annual return of payments made in the previous year, which includes

the Tax Reference details of those receiving payment. The payments made to approved

applicants for the housing aid grants noted above would also be included in this report.

Any contractor employed directly by the Council to carry out what would be deemed

construction works is subject to Relevant Contractor Retention Tax and details of the

contract must be filed with ROS by the Council. Local Authorities are deemed principal

contractors and if the practice of paying contractors instead of the approved housing

grant applicants for works under the Housing grant scheme, it could be deemed that

the RCT system would apply.

 In exceptional circumstances, we do authorise payment to contractors where an

applicant does not have a bank account. These are considered on a case-by-case basis.

The Members noted the response received in relation to the Motion and agreed that it was vital

that the Council should be flexible and ensure that small contractors are supported with regard to

these works and builders should be notified when grant payments are being made to approved

applicants.

**14.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council write to the CEO of Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board and ask him***

The Cathaoirleach confirmed that this Notice of Motion had been withdrawn.

**15.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council appoint***

***a full time traffic warden specifically for the housing estates adjacent to the University of Limerick***

***to tackle the huge parking issues in those estates.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Pond and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the difficulties for residents and the damage

caused by illegal parking in the housing estates surrounding University of Limerick. Members also

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council will examine the possibility of providing additional

resources for areas outside the city centre as needs arise.

The Members noted the response received in relation to the Motion and agreed that additional

resources should be provided where parking issues were arising across the Metropolitan District.

They also agreed the importance of consistency in approach to the problem and that common

sense prevail when imposing fines on people in relation to parking. They also agreed that where

planning permission applications were being considered by the local authority, that adequate

parking provision be a factor as part of the decision making process.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to the***

***Minister for Education and ask her:***

***1.**to confirm if the funding for the expansion of Monaleen N.S. is in place, and***

2. ***to approve Stage 2B submitted to the Department in December last year, without any further***

***delay so that the project can proceed to the official tendering process.***

agreed.

Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board.

It was agreed to write to both the Minister for Education and the Limerick and Clare Education and

Training Board.

**17.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the practice of***

***planning temporary railings around derelict sites, as seen on Parnell Street and Hartstonge***

***Street, be stopped as it causes accessibility issues on footpaths.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Butler and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan highlighted the accessibility issues for wheelchair

users when temporary railings were erected on footpaths, in particular in Parnell Street.

**REPLY**: Safety fencing has been erected by Limerick City and County Council around some

dangerous structures sites in accordance with Section 3 of the Local Government Sanitary

Services Act 1964. Temporary safety fencing is sometimes required to minimise the health

and safety risks posed by these dangerous structures to the passing public. Installed safety

fencing can only be removed once the risks have been resolved but we aim to ensure that

it's duration on site is minimised to ensure minimal disruption where possible.

Members requested a more detailed response and it was agreed to include the item on the agenda

for further discussion at the April Local Electoral Area Briefings.

Members thanked Nuala Gallagher, Director of Service for her work on the project and wished her

well in her new role with Liverpool City Council.

**REPLY**: The Council has appointed a contractor to deliver the new playground for People’s Park.

The contractor’s programme has identified a potential start on site in June, which takes into

QUESTIONS

9.  Question submitted by Councillors Carey and Mitchell

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore /Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on Cllr. William O Donnell’s motion from 18th of January 2018 regarding investigations on

the 15 car-park spaces proposed for Sycamore Drive, Bruff.”

**Reply:**

Following the motion put down in January 2018, it was proposed to install 15 new parking

spaces utilising the green/playing area in Sycamore Drive. This proposal would significantly

reduce the only green area in the estate. The Cappamore/Kilmallock MD office have

identified alternative areas within the estate for the provision of these spaces. The final

design is currently being prepared and will be available before the April Municipal District

meeting. It should be noted that the installation of these additional spaces is estimated to

cost €35,000 and there is no budget available at present to deliver these works.

10. Question submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the proposed footpath [design, funding applications etc...] that would connect

Garrienderk and Charleville.”

**Reply:**

The footpath requested between Garrienderk and Charleville was put forward to the

Limerick Active Travel Office for submission to the NTA to consider the project for funding.

The scheme has not been approved for funding under the current NTA allocations for 2023.

11. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District if a review of

the Disability Parking Spaces in the Municipal District has taken place and if the statutory

process is completed for these spaces.”

**Reply:**

The review of disability spaces across the Municipal District is ongoing. A report should be

available for the May meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock MD

12. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District what progress

has been made on the design/refurbishment of the Bank of Ireland building in Bruff and for

a timescale when the building will be ready for use.”

**Reply:**

Responsibility for the delivery of the new Innovation/Hub Facility at the old Bank of Ireland

building in Bruff now rests with Innovate Limerick. Innovate Limerick has commenced the

procurement process to appoint a Design Team for the refurbishment of the building and it

is expected that this Team will be appointed around the middle of this year.

The exact timescale for when the project will be ready for use cannot be confirmed at this

time as the program will be agreed when the design team is appointed and delivery will be

subject to planning consent to change of use and grant funding been secured to deliver the

entire project. However at this time I would estimate the time frame been in the range of 12

to 18 months.

13. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on the Oola wastewater treatment plant.”

**Reply:**

I have received an update from the Asset Management Department advising that Uisce Eireann have

issued a work order to a contractor for the design of a new inlet screen, storm tank and sludge

management facilities at Oola Wastewater Treatment Plant, Co. Limerick under the inlet works,

storm tank and storm tank programme.

Design works are currently ongoing and a planning application is expected to be lodged this year.

Subject to continued budget availability and statutory approvals, a construction work order is then

expected to be issued to our contractor in 2024. The works will improve the performance of the

wastewater treatment plant but will not result in an increase in the loading capacity of the plant.
---
14. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District to get the

capacity and load of the wastewater treatment plant in Kilmallock.”

**Reply:**

“We publish waste water treatment capacity registers annually for each county. These

registers give an indication of available capacity at Uisce Éireann’s waste water treatment

plants in the county. The capacity available at treatment plants changes regularly based

upon the loads received from existing customers. Our registers are only an indication of

available capacity.

The register for County Limerick is available here

(https://www.water.ie/connections/developer-services/capacity-registers/wastewater-

treatment-capacity-register/limerick/) and indicates spare capacity is available in Kilmallock

WWTP.

It is envisaged there is adequate capacity available at Kilmallock WWTP to cater for the

projected population growth set out in the Limerick Development Plan. In all instances, if

you are considering to progress a development, you should contact our Connections team

who will provide a greater level of detail in relation to the availability of waste water

treatment capacity.

Learn more about the pre connection enquiry and waste water connections process in the

Connections section of this site, https://www.water.ie/connections/.”

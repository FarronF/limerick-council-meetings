***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Trade and***

***Investment Unit provide an update on activities and plans to maintain our competitiveness and***

***attractiveness for new business to establish in the city centre.***

**REPLY**: Thank you for your inquiry into the measures that are being implemented to maintain the

recognise the critical role of fostering a thriving business environment in the heart of the

city, and we are committed to the Limerick 2030 Economic and Special Plan and the Limerick---
4

Development Plan 2022-2028 to meet this objective.

**Retail Economic Incentive Scheme**

Operated by the Trade & Investment Team, the Retail Economic Incentive Scheme was

Preference will be given to applicants that support the production and retail of arts, crafts

and creative / cultural enterprises; and which incentivise the community of Kings Island to

showcase their production methods as well as selling products.

Additionally, Limerick City and County Council are pursuing the following initiatives to

maintain, attract and improve competitiveness for new businesses to establish in the---
5

city centre:

 **Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC** continue to help deliver on initiatives set out in the Limerick

2030 Economic and Spatial Plan. It is involved in two large-scale city centre strategic

infrastructure projects, Opera Square and the Cleeves Riverside Quarter, which when

complete will provide high spec modern office and retail space and residential

accommodation which will make the city centre a more attractive place to live and do

business.

 **Investment in Infrastructure**: The substantial investment in the redevelopment of

O’Connell Street will enhance the appeal of the city centre, improve accessibility and

promote business activities.

 **Innovate Limerick** continues to facilitate the growth of small and medium-sized

enterprises in the city centre, as well as supporting multi national companies with

establishing a presence in the region.

 **Engine Hubs** are providing comfortable and secure remote working hubs for

professionals in the city centre.

 **Sustainability Initiatives**: There have been steps towards making Limerick a ‘smart city’

with sustainable, eco-friendly initiatives, specifically through the CityXchange project,

which is attracting like-minded businesses.

 **Local Enterprise Office**: Grants and other business supports are available through the

Local Enterprise Office to attract and retain business in the city centre, as well as the

wider county.

 **Street Cleaning Service**: Our enhanced street cleaning services aim to create a cleaner,

more appealing city centre. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but

also creates an inviting atmosphere for businesses and shoppers alike.

 **Public Consultations and Partnerships**: Engagement with local businesses and the

public to understand their needs and concerns is ongoing and has led to initiatives such

as the Limerick Laneways Project and the future of the Arthurs Quay area of the city.

We trust that this comprehensive approach will meet the needs of a dynamic business

environment and make Limerick city centre a compelling place for new ventures.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick who is contracted to collect***

***and maintain dog fouling bins and what is the frequency of collection times.***

**REPLY**: The Domestic Waste & Litter Team manage three dog bins located at Dooradoyle Road,

Church Road, Raheen and Father Russell Road. Each bin is serviced weekly by an authorised

waste collector, Whites Skip Hire. Any of the general waste litter bins provided by Limerick

City and County Council’s Cleansing Team may be used for disposing of dog waste.

Limerick City and County Council promotes the ‘Any Bag, Any Bin’ approach and request

dog owners to take responsibility for the removal of their pets' waste from public places

and dispose of it in a proper manner.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many applications have***---
6

***been submitted, the number approved and refused for a Local Authority Home Loan over the last***

***year.***

**REPLY**: Since August 2022 to date we have received

68 Local Authority Home Loan Applications

26 Applications were approved

21 Applications were refused

Remainder of application were returned as incomplete/ineligible.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a breakdown of***

***quantities of glyphosate and any other pesticides used both by Limerick City and County Council***

***staff and contractors over the last 3 years and what efforts have been made to reduce or***

***eliminate the use of toxic chemical pesticides.***

**REPLY:** Parks Department

The Council wishes to advise that weed spraying is no longer permitted in the annual grass

cutting contract. Strimming is the method of weed removal for this contract. This has been

in place for the last two years. The Council also wishes to advise that weed spraying is not

carried out in the Council’s various Parks throughout the city and county. Every possible

effort has been made to minimise the use of glyphosate.

Cleansing Section

The Cleansing Section manage a weed spraying contract which covers public roads and

adjacent footpaths in Limerick City. The following quantities of pesticide containing 360

grams per litre of glyphosate were used in recent years:

2023: works ongoing, estimated 600 litres

2022: approximately 600 litres

2020: 596 litres

2019: 530 litres

The contractor employed by the Council uses specialised equipment consisting of a compact

tractor mounted sprayer which uses photosynthetic detectors. The use of these

photosynthetic detectors ensures that the pesticide is only applied where plant life is

present to ensure the usage of pesticide usage is minimised and to avoid blanket spraying

of surfaces.

Metropolitan District Roads Operations use 65 litres per year approximately, for localised

weed problems. We hope to reduce this usage by expanding the programme of works

currently contracted out by the Council to minimise use (as outlined above).

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the taking***

***in charge process for Danesfort estate in Corbally.***

**REPLY**: Danesfort estate is on our taking in charge work programme. The Roads Department are

undertaking a review of the road report on file, along with a current costing breakdown. A

CCTV survey of the foul and storm network has been arranged, and will be conducted in

the coming weeks.

Once this information has been submitted we will be in a position to finalise a cost

associated with taking the estate in charge.

**13.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***progress of the widening of Golf Links Road by O'Shea's Pub.***

**REPLY**: A Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) for the acquisition of lands to deliver this project was

submitted to An Bord Pleanála in July 2023. An Bord Pleanála have indicated that the case

is due to be decided by 23rd January 2024. The detailed design for the scheme will progress

following confirmation of the CPO by An Bord Pleanála.

**14.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***progress on the distributor road connecting Groody Road to Golf Links Road/Old School House***

***Road junction.***

**REPLY**: MHL Consultants have been appointed on this scheme and the scheme has developed

through to NTA Phase 3 – Preliminary Design.

To Progress to Phase 4 – Statutory Approvals, a Natura Impact Statement has been prepared

for inclusion with a planning application to An Bord Pleanála. The NIS is currently going

through final reviews and the timelines to complete the NIS have been longer than initially

expected. The Consultant has attributed this delay to having to include for recently

published legislation on Climate Impact and on delays with the production of

photomontages.

Active Travel now expects to lodge the planning application and associated CPO

documentation with An Bord Pleanála (ABP) early in Q4 2023. The approval of a scheme by

ABP is not within the control of the Council and accordingly it is difficult to determine a

decision date and if any planning conditions that may impact on detailed design

development may be conditioned.

But the following is the current best estimate:

Planning & CPO approval: Q3 2024

Tender for Construction: Q4 2024---
9

Anticipate Construction Commencement: Q1 2025 (note that there is significant amount of

fill material requirement, which is weather dependent task and could result in delay of start

date.)

Anticipate Construction Completion: Late Q4 2025 / Q1 2026.

procurement of Consultants for the preparation of the detailed design and tender

documents. The project will progress to this stage towards the latter end of 2023.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress has been***

***made on the taking in charge of the road at the back of the Dochas Mid-West premises at Parnell***

***Street.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Roads department have completed a taking in charge

survey of this road at the back of the Dochas Mid-West premises at Parnell Street. The Roads

***the construction program for the proposed new distributor road linking the Golf Links Road with***

***the Kilbane Roundabout on the Groody Road. The construction of this Link Road is extremely***

***urgent as the new secondary school is near completion and about to open.***

**REPLY**: MHL Consultants have been appointed on this scheme and the scheme has developed

To Progress to Phase 4 – Statutory Approvals, a Natura Impact Statement has been prepared---
11

for inclusion with a planning application to An Bord Pleanála. The NIS is currently going

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for progress update on the***

***approved Road Widening and Bridge Upgrade Works at the Junction of the Golf Links Road L1116***

***and the Old Ballysimon Road L1171. I am requesting an update of when improvements work will***

is due to be decided by 23rd January 2024. The detailed design for the scheme will progress

following confirmation of the CPO by An Bord Pleanála.

**22.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that the Chief Executive,***

***commences the variation process to amend existing policies in the Limerick Development Plan***

***and the Limerick housing strategy in relation to social and affordable housing provision to enable***

***the inclusion of a new policy in these same plans that would seek to ensure all new housing***

***developments (excluding single apartment block developments in the city centre) of greater than***

***25 residential units, that at least 50% of these residential units will be allocated for private***

***market sale through one of the following.***

***1 Private Purchase***

***2 Affordable Purchase.***

***The reason for this is to ensure a balanced tenure mix in all developments that will contribute to***

***settled and sustainable communities.***

**REPLY**: The Limerick City and County Housing Strategy and Housing Need Demand Assessment

2022 – 2028, which is incorporated into Volume 6 of the Limerick Development Plan was

developed based on a robust methodology to inform decision making on current and future---
12

housing supply.

Policy P012 in the Housing Strategy seeks to promote an appropriate social and tenure mix

for large scale turnkey housing built for the Council or Approved Housing Bodies. Amending

the policy as suggested would result in an inflexible policy that would not account for

prevailing market circumstances.

It is recommended that the implementation of the current policy is discussed at a Housing

Strategic Policy Committee in advance of any decision taken to vary the Development Plan

policy.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, it was agreed to take this question as a Notice of Motion.

Senior Planner, Forward Planning, noted that this is related to a variation of the Limerick

Development Plan 2022-2028 which can only be discussed at Full Council. Following discussions

on the matter, the Cathaoirleach agreed to refer this item to the Special Meeting of Limerick City

and County Council in relation to the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028.

**23.**

**REPLY**: There would be considerable additional funding required to open the scheme to applicants

in receipt of current qualifying payments and half rate Carers to the Bin Waiver Scheme for

2024.

**24.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to the Housing***

***Aid for Older People why are upgrades of existing double glazed PVC windows not approved on***

windows are not eligible, but repairs or replacement glazing may be considered on a case

by case basis if they are end of life.---

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress has been***

***made on the Turner Vinery, what initial grant was allocated and to who was the initial funds***

***given. How much has been spent to date and where is the vinery currently.***

**REPLY:** In 2022 the Council undertook to lead on the restoration and reinstatement of Turner

Vinery, a 19th century brick, wrought and cast iron glasshouse, designed by renowned

ironmaster Richard Turner. The project involves three distinct phases:

Phase A: The Restoration & Partial Reconstruction of the Masonry Structure

Phase B: Historic Ironwork Conservation Works and Reconstruction of Original Frame on

Site

Phase C: Re-Glazing of Repaired and Reconstructed Frame.

Prior to the Council taking the lead on this project Tait House Community Enterprise

obtained €153,000 in funding in relation to the restoration of Turner Vinery. €29,413 of this

funding has been spent to date on Turner Vinery rehabilitation works however further

works were paused due to insufficient level of funding available. The balance €123,587 has

been transferred to the Council as project lead on this development.

During 2022 the preparation of a Condition Survey, Conservation Strategy and specification

was successfully completed under the Heritage Councils Community Heritage Grant Scheme

2022.

In March 2023, based on the output of the Community Heritage Grant and alongside a

committed contribution from Tait House Community Enterprise of the 2017 funding

provision balance, the Council were successful in obtaining a Historic Structures Fund grant

allocation of €160,000: €80,000 in 2023 and €80,000 in 2024.

The Council have commenced the procurement process for the appointment of a Grade 1

Conservation Architect as per condition of the Historic Structures Fund grant allocation with

an expected appointment in Q4, 2023 subject to agreement from the DHLGH to the

appointment.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the status***

***committed to in 2020 under Active Travel proposals.***

**REPLY**: The road between the Clonmacken and Coonagh roundabouts is included in the Limerick

**Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***roundabout maintenance plan and sponsorship scheme with particular reference to the Coonagh***

***and Clondrinagh roundabouts and the upkeep of same.***

**REPLY**: The Council has a Roundabout Sponsorship Scheme, which is advertised annually. A

number of roundabouts have been successfully sponsored in recent years with Kilmallock

roundabout due to be completed by the end of this year. There are a number of other

roundabouts where interest has been expressed and the Council is progressing these

particular roundabouts.

In relation to the Coonagh and Clondrinagh roundabouts, the Council has been proactive in

trying to secure sponsorship for these two particular roundabouts as they are located on

the main approach roads to Limerick. The Council has emailed a number of companies to

garner interest in the scheme and provide details of the sponsorship, highlighting the

availability of the Coonagh and Clondrinagh roundabouts. In the interim, these

roundabouts are maintained by Council employees and a contractor in the case of the

Clondrinagh roundabout. The Council are due to carryout maintenance on the Coonagh

roundabout in the next two weeks.

The Council would also like to advise that there is a dedicated page on www.limerick.ie with

details on the Roundabout Sponsorship Scheme. An advert is due to be placed in the

Limerick Post and Limerick Leader this Autumn, highlighting the scheme.

and dispose of it in a proper manner.

Any of the general waste litter bins provided by Limerick City and County Council’s Cleansing

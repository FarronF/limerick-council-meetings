**Disposal of Land**

(a)

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Officer, Housing Support Services dated

31st July, 2023 setting out proposals for disposal of Freehold Interest of premises

consisting of a dwelling house situate at Knockboheen, Kilcolman, Ardagh, Co.

Limerick and the intention to bring the Section 183 Notice to Full Council for

approval.

The report, as circulated, was noted by Members.

(b)

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development,

Enterprise and Tourism dated 1st September, 2023 setting out proposals for

disposal of Adare Heritage Centre to Discover Limerick DAC and the intention to

bring the Section 183 Notice to Full Council for approval.

Councillor Teskey expressed his opposition to this disposal and questioned if current

contractual arrangements with existing tenants would be forfeited with the proposed

upgrade of the centre and was adamant the Library and carpark not form part of the

disposal. Councillor Teskey requested the present Management Company be invited to

attend a future Meeting to discuss the matter further.

The Senior Executive Officer, Economic Development, Enterprise and Tourism advised

Members the current Management Company will no longer be running the Adare

Heritage Centre from 1st November, 2023 and the proposal is only to dispose of the

original leasehold to Discover Limerick DAC, who are a wholly owned subsidiary

company of Limerick City and County Council. Discover Limerick DAC will apply for

funding to modernise the Heritage Centre and the Library and carpark spaces will remain

owned and operated by Limerick City and County Council.

Discussion ensued and Members were in agreement the disposal of the Adare Heritage

Centre should be adjourned for 12 months to enable a feasibility study to take place and

for Discover Limerick DAC to provide audited accounts.

Service to the Meeting.

active responders. He outlined the types of emergency calls the volunteers attend as

well as the issues they face due to lack of funding.

Ambulance Service.

12th September, 2023 outlining details of proposed works, projects and future projects

planned for the District.

Following discussion the following issues were raised by Members:

Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing advised he would convey this to Traffic

Infrastructure Ireland.

 Councillor Collins stated diversion routes around Adare village from the N21 are

not adequate to accommodate traffic in the event of a road traffic collision

occurring. Councillor Keary fully supported this observation and requested An

Garda Síochána provide suitable traffic management plans to avoid traffic from

each side of the N21 at Adare being diverted on to the same route when an

incident occurs.

**6.**

**Library Services**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Limerick City and County Librarian to the Meeting.

Councillor Sheahan requested Item 10 would be taken in connection with this Item.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the County Librarian be invited to prepare a**

**detailed plan of action for the future of Askeaton Library.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Collins and

agreed.

Councillor Collins added the Library is valuable service in the community and requested

a presentation be provided to Members on services and events within the libraries.

Councillor O’Donoghue further requested a presentation on the operation of the mobile

library and the cost of running libraries within the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District.

Limerick City and County Librarian stated he would be happy to provide a presentation

at a future Meeting.

**Reply:**

We have three requests in relation to the Carnegie Library building in

Askeaton:

1. A request to provide an enhanced library offer in Askeaton

2. A request from “Deel Art Group” to acquire the top floor of the

building for use as an arts space.

3. A request from Askeaton Contemporary Arts that they be included in

any proposals.

Feeney McMahon Architects were appointed to produce a design

proposal for the building and they submitted the following key

recommendations in September 2022:

1. The building is not suitable for dual-function use.

2. The use of the building as a Public Library only will not yield any

increase or improvement in usable space as universal public access is

not possible to the upper floor.

3. The most optimal solution is to configure the building to accommodate

an arts facility only.

In parallel, in May 2022 we had a new request to give consideration to use

the recently purchased Bank of Ireland building in the square for library

purposes and possibly arts purposes. In response, library staff visited the

building and found that in terms of location, size and accessibility the bank

site has greater potential to offer an enhanced library and arts service.

However, in recent months a call to provide accommodation for Ukrainian

refugees led to the designation for the moment of this building for this

use.

It is also noted that Askeaton Library is currently up and running and will

continue to be for the future.

**8.**

**General Municipal Allocation (GMA)**

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Teskey, it was agreed to

allocate the following:

 €3,000 to Askeaton Tennis Club.

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor K. Sheahan**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council make a submission to Central**

**Government to have funding provided to address the tidal flooding that takes place in**

**Askeaton town every year.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue

and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheahan raised the issue of the sewerage holding tank

in Askeaton overflowing recently and sludge being blown up the river through the town.

Councillor Sheahan asked if this holding tank can be emptied more frequently and if an

alarm could be put on the tank that would alert the contractor charged with emptying the

tank to attend and prevent further occurrences of this nature being inflicted on the

population of Askeaton town.

**Draft Adare Local Area Plan**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Special Meeting to discuss the Draft Adare

Local Area Plan.

At the outset of the Meeting, Councillor Teskey expressed his disappointment at the lack

of engagement with Councillors from the Council Executives prior to the joining of the

Adare Local Area Plan with the Adare Public Realm Plan. He stated that he had originally

requested both plans be linked, not married together. Councillor Sheahan further added

that as the two plans were now joined into one statutory plan that as Councillors their

authority to adopt the Adare Local Area Plan has now been relinquished.

The Senior Planner, Forward Planning, Public Realm & Heritage advised that the

adoption of the Local Area Plan remains a function of the elected members. She further

stated the Plan is currently on public display and anyone can make submissions in

relation to the draft plan. A Chief Executive Report will then be prepared based on the

submissions received on the draft plan and will be brought before the Adare-Rathkeale

Municipal District Elected Members to consider or amend it.

Executive Planner, Ms. O’Connell then proceeded to go through the content of the Draft

Plan which was prepared in consultation with the local community of Adare.

Discussion ensued in relation to the contents of the Plan. Members expressed concern

in relation to the proposed expansion of pedestrian areas and cycle lanes as well as the

replacement of on-street parking with off-street parking. The Senior Executive
---
Architect, Forward Planning, Public Realm & Heritage assured Members the new

proposals for cycle lanes will not affect the width of the road through the village and

also added car parking spaces cannot be removed without identifying another

alternative parking site.

Councillor O’Brien queried if provisions have been made for car parking spaces in the

area where the new rail network will reopen. The Senior Planner, advised that there are

no plans for a passenger train in the lifetime of this Local Area Plan.

Councillor Keary stated the issue of local people from Adare building one off houses also

needs to be addressed. Ms. O’Connell advised there are currently 139 units with

planning permission and also land zoned for the provision of another 156 units to

accommodate this issue.

Councillor Collins stated that contrary to early statements by members, the Forward

Planning Team had been instructed by the Members to include the Adare Public Realm

Plan within the Adare Local Area Plan.

Councillor Collins further stated that the Village Hall is the centre of Adare village and

plans to upgrade this community facility should be included in the Plan. She also

encouraged people to attend the public information evening due to be held on the 7th

September in the Village Hall and to forward any submission they may have before then.

This concluded the Meeting.

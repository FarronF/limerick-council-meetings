Several members of the committee commended the HAT team and their dedication. The committee

members welcomed the various initiatives such as “DIAL” house and future plans for young adults

who may be a risk of homelessness.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Sarah Kiely asked if there any plans to roll out Novas DIAL House service

further. In response Ms. O’Connor confirmed that there is demand for the DIAL service and that

there are plans to roll the service out further in Q2 2024 in line with the new “Youth Homelessness

Strategy 2023-2025". Ms. O’Connor confirmed that Novas are currently the only provider to run the

DIAL model.

Cllr. Kiely asked if HAT get many referrals from the HSE. Ms. O’Connor advised that there are several

referral pathways mainly from the HSE and Tulsa and that the HAT team work closely with Voluntary

Organisations and Approved Housing Bodies depending on client needs.

Cllr. Sharon Benson enquired how family disputes are resolved. Ms. O’Connor advised that a holistic

needs assessment is undertaken and in some circumstances mediation services may be required.

Ms. Una Burns, Sectoral Representative for Social Inclusion advised that research was commissioned

on the impact of DIAL House entitled “A Social Return on Investment Analysis on the Impact of DIAL

House”. Ms. Burns added that the key findings of the evaluation highlighted the significant benefits

of DIAL for young people who are transitioning from care to living on their own and that the

innovative service creates positive outcomes for stakeholders working alongside DIAL house.

Ms. Mary Hayes, Senior Executive Officer, Housing informed the SPC that there is a Steering group

established under the auspices of the National Homelessness Action Committee (NHAC) to drive the

Ms. Hayes advised that the group meet on a regular basis and are reviewing Limericks experience of

**Item 4: Presentation on the Affordable Housing Launch**

Ms. Martina Frawley, Administrative Officer, Housing presented on the Affordable Housing Launch

for the Brú na Gruadán, Affordable Home Purchase Scheme. The presentation was well received by

the committee who complimented the comprehensive information available on the website.

A discussion on the Affordable Home Scheme took place. Cllr. Sharon Benson welcomed the

Affordable Housing Scheme in Limerick but commented that the scheme is not affordable and that

many applicants will find that their income and additional savings required will make these units out

of reach for them. Cllr. Benson stated that a new Affordable Scheme needs to be considered by the

Government.

Cllr. Tom Ruddle enquired if the banks are willing to work with his, how the equity share is paid back

and what interest is charged? Ms. Martina Frawley replied that there are priority lending

agreements in place with the main banks AIB, Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland.

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary enquired if there was indexation on redemption repayments

on the equity share.

Ms. Frawley explained that the information on equity share and obligations of the purchaser and the

Council are set out in the legal contract “Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangement”.

Tracy Mc Elligott, Sectoral Representative, Community/Voluntary enquired about the example on

slide 8 of the presentation and the price the purchaser has to pay. Cllr. Seán Hartigan asked about

minimum income and deposit required. An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary enquired about the

figures presented and asked if they were only applicable to the Brú na Gruadán, Affordable Home

Purchase Scheme. Ms. Frawley advised that it is not necessary for applicants to calculate how much

they will contribute to the cost of an affordable home. LCCC will do this for each successful

applicant. There is also an income calculator for each home type included in the Eligibility Criteria

and FAQ document for the scheme (available on the Affordable Housing website).

Cllr. Conor Sheehan also welcomed the first Affordable Housing Scheme in Limerick and stated that

the scheme is not affordable as it’s a market discount scheme and applicants will be taking on too

much debt. Cllr. Sheehan enquired when data on applicants would be available, what impact

inflation would have on the scheme and if the Council can advise on the affordable price of units

built on Council land.

Ms. Frawley responded that the online portal opens on the 20th June and that the affordable

applicant data would be analysed in due course.

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary enquired if Limerick City and County Council would consider

making land available for new modular homes similar to which Cork City Council have provided for

Ukrainian refugees.

Ms. Frawley added that the Council have some local authority land that we have looked for AHF

funding, including Curragower Lands for 9 affordable purchase units and Toppins Lands for 28

affordable purchase units. Ms. Sarah Newell stated that Toppins Field is a pilot scheme for Modular

Build and that Mr. Mick Forde-Bradley gave a workshop on Modern Methods of Construction earlier

this year.

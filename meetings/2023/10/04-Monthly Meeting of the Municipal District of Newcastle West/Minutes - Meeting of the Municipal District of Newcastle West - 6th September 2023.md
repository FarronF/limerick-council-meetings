Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed update on the Programme of Works for***

***Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan and Dates.***

REPLY:

Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) are undertaking a pavement improvement scheme on

N21 from Mountmahon to Church in Abbeyfeale. Tenders were returned in mid-August 2023

and are currently being assessed. This project involves pavement improvement works and a

section of watermain replacement. This project may be complete by end of year or extend

into February 2024.

The Abbeyfeale Public Realm Scheme has an advance works contract on site for demolition

of O’Riordan’s pub. Tender documents are being finalised for Phase 1 of the scheme involving

400 metres on Killarney Road from Cellar Bar to doctor’s surgery and upgrading of Grove

Crescent car park. The timing of the TII pavement improvement scheme and Phase 1 scheme

are being coordinated as it is not permitted for two contactors to work on N21 in close

proximity to each other at the same time, due to the level of traffic disruption.

Phase 1 will commence upon completion of TII pavement improvement scheme and will take

approximately eight months to complete. Phase 2 of Abbeyfeale Public Realm Scheme

***School into a safe and usable condition for the people using it.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY:

This laneway is likely in the ownership of the Department of Education currently even though

it is deemed unregistered on the Land Registry database.

I will check initially the possibility of this laneway being acceptable for funding under an LIS

Scheme with the Department of Transport.

In replying, Councillor Collins referred to the taking in charge of the laneway and stated that

this laneway is a vital link from Gortboy to the Desmond Complex and that this laneway is

being used by parents and children to access creche facilities. The issue of stagnant water on

the laneway was also raised. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that he has

liaised with Central Services on this matter and that this laneway may not qualify for a Local

Improvement Scheme. He also stated that a Local Improvement Scheme will only guarantee
---
12

a once off treatment whereas this laneway requires ongoing maintenance. The Senior

Executive Engineer agreed to liaise with the Department of Education with a view to taking

this laneway in charge.

The following items were also raised.

The Members expressed dissatisfaction on the various street lights currently not operational

in the District and it was agreed that as the Director of Transportation and Mobility was being

Cemetery to the rear of the Church in Templeglantine and in replying, the Meetings

Administrator agreed to seek a further update from the relevant Directorate on this matter.

An update was sought on traffic calming measures at Knockaderry village and in replying the

Senior Executive Engineer stated that the NTA Programme is aiding traffic calming measures

in the following villages over the past number of years including Newcastle West, Abbeyfeale,

Athea, Glin, Tournafulla, Dromcollogher and this year works are ongoing in Ardagh, Athea,

Monagea, Feenagh and Kilmeedy. He also stated that going forward the NTA Programme will

be extended to cover other villages including Broadford, Castlemahon, Knockaderry and

Carrickerry.

village at present. He stated that there are a number of gullies in Knockaderry but are placed

in poor locations and are not taking surface waters into the drainage system. He also stated

that Limerick City and County Council have placed a dozen gullies at locations that will have a

positive impact in Knockaderry village.

late Dolores O’Riordan, lead singer with the Cranberries, following her untimely passing. The

Members paid tribute to her musical talent and her huge achievements with the Cranberries

on the world stage, which brought huge pride to all in her native Limerick. A minute’s

Deputation

The Cathaoirleach welcomed a Deputation to the Meeting from Kilfinane Coshlea

Historical Society comprising of Angela Hennessy, Patsy McGrath, Robert O’Sullivan and

Dermot O’Shaughnessy.

The Deputation addressed the Meeting and explained that they were formed in 1999

with the aim of researching and collecting local and family history within the Barony of

Coshlea. The Society’s headquarters was at Ballinvreena Community Hall and they had

undertaken several projects.

They informed the Members that their current project was titled “Where did your

ancestors live in 1911,” which had begun over two years ago. This project involved

procuring a 1911 map of each townland and identifying the families living in the townland

and their homes on these maps. To date, they had completed 27 townland maps, including

the town of Kilfinane, listing 2,130 people and 472 houses in total.

They outlined that they had explored the feasibility of developing a website to carry

all the project data in a user-friendly and easily searchable manner, which would enable

families to identify the actual field/street in which they lived in 1911, and this might prompt

them to visit the area. However, they were finding the cost of this beyond their resources

and were appealing to the District for financial support for this worthwhile project.

Members commended the group on their presentation and acknowledged the work

of the Kilfinane Coshlea Historical Society.

The Deputation thanked the Members and then withdrew.

QUESTION

4.

Question submitted by Councillor W. O’Donnell

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***for an update on investigations into the parking issues which***

***exist at Sycamore Drive, Bruff.***

**REPLY:**

An initial design has been prepared to address the parking issue at Sycamore

Drive, Bruff. This design will provide an additional 15 car parking spaces.

However, there will be a significant reduction to the size of the public

green space. A public consultation meeting will be necessary to ensure the

design meets the approval of the Sycamore Drive residents. Once agreement

is reached on the proposed design, funding will be sought.

NOTICE OF MOTION

5.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on Irish Rail to reopen Kilmallock***

***Railway Station which would be serviced by passing trains; I will also move that this***

***District write to Irish Rail to invite them to attend a future Meeting of the District to***

***discuss this proposal.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy and seconded by Councillor

Donegan.

It was agreed that a meeting between Irish Rail, the Council and Community

Stakeholders would be organised to discuss this proposal.

Other Matters Raised

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the

following items were raised:

•

Condition of Roads

The Members expressed their concerns over the condition of the roads at present.

They highlighted that there were numerous lorries pulling heavy loads of timber during the

winter months when the roads were more vulnerable to damage. They acknowledged that

there had been a lot of rainfall recently blocking inlets and gullies, which did not help the

condition of the roads either. Some Members felt that a provision for an allocation to

purchase a grader should be considered which would help alleviate the problem.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer agreed with the Members that the roads were in a

bad condition at present. He stated that they had been trying to improve drainage where

possible. He added that there was a lot more development taking place which resulted in

greater volumes of traffic on the roads and due to the recent weather conditions and lack of

funding, they did not have the resources to maintain the standard of some roads.

•

Irish Walled Towns Network Kilmallock

The Members expressed concern about the possibility that there would be no

funding nationally for the Irish Walled Towns Network in 2018. This would have a major

impact on some projects in the Municipal District area, which were currently being assisted

by the Irish Walled Towns Network. The Members agreed that it was vital that the Heritage

Council would continue funding of the Irish Walled Towns Network in 2018.

•

Vote of Sympathy

A Vote of Sympathy was extended to Councillor Donegan on the death of his uncle,

John Donegan, Ardkilmartin, Kilmallock, Co. Limerick.

This concluded the Meeting.

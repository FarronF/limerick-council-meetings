**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***had been used in events which were not official Council duties or events and the reason why***

***the Chain of the Metropolitan Mayor was used at same.***

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the current status of any plans to address the***

***road maintenance issues raised by residents of Ahane.***

**REPLY:**

This query refers to an issue raised by a resident of the LP1122 who lives on the

Left Hand Side of road between the railway bridge and Ahane Church. There is an

old masonry wall along this stretch of road that is maintained by the---
5

residents and the wall is kept in good condition. The boundary ditch opposite this

wall is overgrown but also includes an old dry stone wall that is in poor condition.

The length of this wall is 600 m approximately and a scheme is requested to

remove the ditch and the remains of the existing wall and build a new masonry

wall and foundation.

The budget required for such a scheme would be large and it would not

be possible to drawn from the funding sources available to the Roads Operations

Section. Heritage or Conservation grants could be sought but the costs associated

with this proposal is likely to be excessive. The views of the Conservation Officer

would have to be sought as part of the consideration of any works.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

***I will ask at the next meeting if the Council has given recent consideration to a pedestrian***

***crossing being installed opposite entrance to Merchant’s Quay. Many tour buses park in the***

***area to the front of the Civic Offices and visitors frequently need to get safe access to local***

***facilities for food/refreshments.***

**REPLY:**

The Council has applied for funding under the Low Cost Safety Scheme to install a

pedestrian crossing at this location.

It is likely that grants for such works in 2018 will be notified to local authorities

towards the end of January/early February.

The Council will carry out safety improvement works at this location should its

application for funding be successful.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan (to be referred to the Local**

**Electoral Area Briefings)**

***I will move at the next meeting that,*** ***at the start of the new financial year, the Council restore***

***and upgrade the Baggott Estate off Ballinacurra. It became overgrown in recent times and***

***while some remedial work has been done it now needs to be regularly included in the***

***maintenance calendar of the Council.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Local Electoral Area Briefings.

Councillor Hogan expressed disappointment with the decision to refer this item to the Local

Electoral Area Briefings.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District write to the Minister for Health urging him to***

***re-open the 1,500 hospital beds cut from hospitals over the last decade and reverse the other***

***austerity cuts imposed on our health services to pay for the bank bailouts.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville highlighted the ongoing issues with overcrowding

in UL Hospital’s A&E Department and the impact of bed closures over the last number of years

as well as the need to reopen these beds and to provide the staff and support as necessary.

The Members supported the motion and highlighted the ongoing issue regarding waiting time

for patients on trolleys in UL Hospital’s Accident and Emergency Department. Issues noted

included pressures following the downsizing of the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh and St. Johns

Hospital, as well as the ongoing problems with treating private patients in public hospitals.

The investment in the new facilities at the Accident and Emergency Unit was noted by some

Members as well as the increased expenditure on public health.

Following further discussion it was agreed to invite the CEO of UL Hospitals to the February

Metropolitan Meeting in order to outline the measures that UL Hospital Management have

identified to deal with the overcrowding issues in accident and emergency and to outline

progress to date in implementing these measures.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that, in light of the consistent breaches by landlords of***

***minimum standards for rental accommodation and other basic rights of tenants, the Council***

***makes sure to include information about tenants rights in the packs sent to HAP and RAS***

***tenants as part of any housing needs assessment.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville outlined the lack of protection afforded to

tenants and the absence of strict regulatory control over landlords providing unsuitable

standards of accommodation. Members supported the motion and stressed the importance of

tenants being informed of their statutory rights.

**REPLY:**

RAS: The responsibilities of landlords regarding their rights, obligations and

duties concerning compliance with minimum standards are contained in

documentation which is forwarded to landlords considering RAS as part of an

expression of interest being submitted. All RAS properties are inspected prior to

their entering in to the scheme to ensure compliance with relevant standards. In

addition, the rights, obligations and duties of landlords are contained in the RAS

agreement and are explained to landlords during the sign up phase. Each new

RAS tenant and each existing RAS tenant whose contract is being renewed

receive a copy of the Residential Tenancies Board “Good Tenant Guide” which

advises tenants of the duties and responsibilities of both parties as regards the

condition and maintenance of private rented properties. A copy of this

document can be found at the following link: https://www.rtb.ie/tenants/rights-

responsibilities-obligations/good-tenant-guide.

HAP: Each HAP pack contains an information booklet for landlords and

prospective tenants which contain a section regarding minimum standards. In

addition, a copy of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government

“Guide to Minimum Standards in Rented Accommodation (Sept 2017)” is---
7

included in the pack. A copy of this document can be found at the following link:

http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/guide\_to\_minim

um\_standards\_in\_rented\_accommodation\_sept\_2017.pdf.

It should be noted that housing applicants in receipt of social housing assistance

under the RAS and HAP schemes are not included in the housing needs

assessment. This has previously been advised to the elected members by email

on 2nd January 2018.

Following queries in relation to the annual housing needs assessment, the Senior Executive

Officer outlined that Limerick City and County Council, in preparing an assessment of applicants

on the housing waiting list, follows criteria set out by the Department of Housing, Planning,

Community and Local Government. In accordance with this criteria all HAP tenants and RAS

tenants are excluded from this process.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District write to the Minister for Housing urging him***

***to introduce real rent controls in Limerick City, to reverse the rampant profiteering that has***

***taken place over recent years and bring rents down to affordable levels.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller highlighted the issues with rent increases in Limerick

which are ahead of the national average while Limerick remains the only city without rent

pressure zones.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the need for longer leases to provide security

of tenure and also the need to increase the housing supply as well as bringing vacant units back

into use particularly in the Georgian Quarter.

Following further discussion it was agreed to write to the Minister for Housing requesting him to

introduce real rent controls in Limerick City, to reverse the rampant profiteering that has taken

place over recent years and bring rents down to affordable levels.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley (to be referred to the Local**

**Electoral Area Briefings)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that immediate consideration be given to extending the***

***footpath from the traffic lights at the entrance to the Cappamore junction on the R445 to***

***Annacotty Business Park.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Local Electoral Area Briefings.

Councillor Hurley expressed disappointment with the decision to refer this item to the Local

Electoral Area Briefings.---

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley (to be referred to the Local**

**Electoral Area Briefings)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that immediate consideration be given to the widening of the***

***Golf Links Road in Castletroy from the traffic lights to entrance to Castletroy Heights. This is***

***now a public bus route and has become a dangerous stretch of road for passing traffic.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Local Electoral Area Briefings.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council publishes a list of all derelict and undeveloped***

***sites in the District together with the names of the owners and what actions are planned to***

***develop these sites or buildings.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Loftus.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin requested that an update be given to Members on

specific sites in the city, many of these were now vacant for a number of years. In the discussion

that followed Members also asked that the Members be informed of major acquisitions and

expressed disappointment at not being made aware of the purchase of the Salesians School at

an earlier stage.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council maintains and makes available a Derelict Sites

Register for its functional area, which contains the names and addresses of

derelict sites owners.

Limerick City and County Council is in the process of populating the Vacant Site

Register it established in January 2017. Under the requirements of the Urban

Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, the Council can provide notice of intention

to site owners of proposed entry onto the register from 1 January 2018. This

process is currently underway.

There is an appeal process open to potential vacant site owners, which has a

statutory timeframe. Until such a time as this statutory process is completed a list

of ‘undeveloped sites’ is considered premature.

The Senior Executive Officer informed the Members that a new Urban and Village Renewal

Department was recently established. This Department will enable the Council to provide an

enhanced response to dealing with vacant sites/property and to derelict sites. This department

will deal with obligations on vacant sites arising from the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act

2015.

It was agreed that Rosie Webb, Senior Architect in the Urban and Village Renewal Department

would be invited to update Members on the role of this Department and on progress regarding

vacant sites in the Metropolitan District.

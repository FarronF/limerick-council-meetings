QUESTIONS

7**.**

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting; (a) what state agencies are responsible for the River***

***Feale flowing at the back of New Street, Abbeyfeale? (b) who is responsible for dredging***

***that river at the same location? (c) who completed and paid for the repair works at Dan***

***Murphy’s property (RIP) near the bridge on the Allaghaun river Abbeyfeale a**pproximately***

***four years ago and at what cost? (d) what state agencies are responsible for the Allaghaun***

***river at that location? (e) why/how was the Roche property granted planning permission***
---

***along the river bank? (f) can the recent report and design of works carried out at the***

***affected properties on New Street be made available to the Councillors? (g) can the River***

***Feale be dredged immediately along the affected properties on New Street?***

REPLY:

**A. What state agencies are responsible for the River Feale flowing at the**

**back of New St., Abbeyfeale?**

In terms of the erosion that is occurring at this location, the Office of Public

Works has advised the Council that no state agency has legal responsibility for

this part of the river.

**B. Who is responsible for dredging that river at the same location?**

The responsibility for the condition of the channel and riverbanks typically

rests with the riparian owner.

**C. Who completed and paid for the repair works at Dan Murphy’s property**

**(RIP) near the bridge on the Allaghaun River, Abbeyfeale approximately**

**four years ago and at what cost?**

I have been informed that the works on the bridge in Abbeyfeale on the

Allaghaun River were carried out in 2010 and follow up works were carried out

in 2011.

The works were repair works to the bridge and in-stream works to prevent the

bridge supports from being undercut. In addition the traffic flow system over

the bridge was modified in the interest of safety.

The works were carried out as part of the Roads Work Programme and I have

requested that relevant files be examined to determine the cost of the works.

**D. What state agencies are responsible for the Allaghaun River at that**

**location?**

I understand that no state agency has legal responsibility for this part of the

river.

**E. Why/how was the Roche property granted planning permission without**

**a condition of planning that a properly designed/engineered wall be put in**

**place along the river bank?**

I have referred the Question to our Planning and Environmental Services

section who will reply directly on the matter.

**F. Can the recent report and design of works carried out at the affected**

**properties on New St., be made available to the Councillors?**
---
I attach herewith, for your information and consideration, copy of the

Engineering Report from Dennany Reidy Associates Consulting Civil &

Structural Engineers.

**G. Can the River Feale be dredged immediately along the affected**

**properties on New Street?**

Neither the Office of Public Works (OPW) nor Limerick City & County Council

have a statutory responsibility in relation to the drainage/dredging of the River

Feale at this location. The issue of drainage/dredging is a matter for the

riparian land owner.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting if any state agencies had ownership at any time of***

***the Roche site at New St**., Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

In 1970 land of approximately 1/10th of an acre (Folio numbers 26062 and

18970F) at New Street, Abbeyfeale was purchased by Limerick County

Council.

On 25th January 1999 a S183 Disposal Notice was approved by Limerick County

Council and the land in question was consequently disposed of to Nautic

Building Company Ltd, completed in April 1999.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a second costing to be carried out to do the necessary***

***works on the river bank at New St., Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

The Engineering Report in relation to the property at 5 Riverbrook, New

Street, Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick, was carried out by Dennany Reidy

Associates Consulting Civil & Structural Engineers.

This report costed the works required to safeguard this property at

€454,861.10. In addition there will be the costs of professional fees incurred.

The Council is satisfied that this report and estimated cost of works offer a

realistic appraisal of the likely cost of the works of repair.

The Council is also satisfied that commissioning a second report would not

result in a situation whereby the final report from another appropriately

qualified consultancy firm would significantly differ from the original Dennany

Reidy Associates report.
---
Members must also have regard to the fact that commissioning a second

report is likely to require expenditure in the region of €20,000. This financial

resource has not been provided in the 2018 Budget and the Members would

be required to identify a source of funding if they considered it necessary to

commission a second report.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for*** ***an update on necessary traffic flow safety measures***

***a**long Boherbui, Newcastle West between the Secondary School and Church entrances.***

REPLY:

Funding has been allocated from the Development Fund to appoint

consultants to conduct a Transport Study for Newcastle West. The Boherbui

area will form part of this study.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***when safety bollards will be put in place at**(a)* ***Lynch's Corner***

NOTICES OF MOTION

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that our Council review its scheme of Local Authority***

***Housing Rental charges for this Municipality so as to bring local charges in line with rental***

***levels that apply in the Metropolitan area and that this change apply with immediate***

***effect from January 2018.***
---
In proposing the Motion, CouncillorScanlan stated weekly rents within the metro area

were lower than in some rural areas and there should be parity between the two areas.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

REPLY**:**

The rent of local authority tenants in Ireland is calculated in accordance with

the provisions of what is known as a Differential Rents Scheme. Each local

authority adopts, by executive order, its own such Scheme, but they all share

similar characteristics. The rent is calculated as a proportion of the assessable

income of the principal earner, together with a contribution from any

subsidiary earners in the household. The significant advantage that this

confers on local authority tenants over their counterparts in the private

sector is that the rent is based solely on the income of the household and is

not linked to prevailing market forces. The amount payable will vary up or

down in line with income changes of the occupants. At the moment, the

average rent payable by tenants across the entire administrative area of

Limerick City & County Council is just over €50 per week.

While all Differential Rent Schemes are broadly similar in terms of the general

principles outlined above, each local authority would have customised its

Scheme to best suit its circumstances and needs. When the new local authority

was created for Limerick in June 2014, the Schemes for both Limerick City

Council and Limerick County Council were carried forward and continued to

apply. It would clearly have been desirable to design and adopt one uniform

Scheme for the entire administrative area. However, it was decided not to

proceed with this on the basis that the Department was clearly indicating that

the Minister intended to roll out a Scheme which would apply nationally and

would replace any existing local Schemes. Despite such indications continuing,

there are still no concrete proposals emerging for such a step. Having regard

to this, and the need to remove any anomalies in the existing Scheme in this

Authority, it is proposed to consider looking at the possibility of designing the

uniform Scheme referred to above in the current year. Members will, of

course, be consulted in relation to same.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council repair the river bank erosion at the***

***affected properties along New St., Abbeyfeale since the Department of the OPW have***

***refused to do so.***

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin also referred to his questions on New St.

Abbeyfeale. He stated that responses were required with regard to the works near the

Alaughaun Bridge, and the funding of same. He referred to the question on planning

permission at the Roche site, previous Council ownership of the site and the wall built by

the Developer along the riverbank. He asked if the Roche family could be relocated and

highlighted the effects of river erosion at other properties along New St. Abbeyfeale. He
---
proposed that the OPW take ownership of the section of the Rivers Feale and Alaughaun

which flow through Abbeyfeale and that the Minister of State with responsibility for the

OPW be written to in this regard.

*The Members referred the prohibition on the removal of gravel from the River Feale and that*

*river erosion issues require a National solution similar to flooding issues.*

*The Director, Physical Development Directorate, stated the responsibility for flooding issues is*

*vested in the OPW and he referred to the OPW Minor Works Scheme, under which the Council*

*had made an application with regard to New St. Abbeyfeale. It was noted that the application*

*was deemed ineligible as the issues at New St. Abbeyfeale relate to river erosion and not*

*flooding. He stated that further requests for funding had also been denied. He referred to the*

*assistance the Council had given within the resources available and to riparian ownership*

*responsibilities.*

The Director, Service Operations, stated that planning permission was granted in 1999 for the

site at New St. Abbeyfeale. He noted from the planning file there was no commentary on

erosion issues at this location and therefore it appeared erosion was not a known or

anticipated issue at the time.

The Members disagreed with some of the responses but concurred that the Roche family be

relocated. It was *proposed by Cllr. Sheahan and seconded by Cllr. Collins, that the Council's*

*Chief Executive make contact with the OPW and request a derogation under*

*the OPW's Relocation Scheme for the purchase of a house. The Director, Physical*

*Development Directorate agreed to follow up on this request.*

The Executive Engineer stated works with regard to issues with surface water have been

carried out at Templeglantine National School and the location will be monitored to ensure

that these works have resolved the surface water drainage issue.

The Director stated that a plan for the overall management of graveyards within the district

is being developed and community graveyard proposals would be considered as part of this

review.

The issue of fencing at the Waste Water Treatment Plant, Tournafulla, was also raised and

this matter will be forwarded to the Water Services Section for response.

It was agreed to hold the February Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 7th February, 2018,

at 10.00 a.m., at Áras William Smith OBrien.

This concluded the Meeting.

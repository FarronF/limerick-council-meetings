Members wished former Chief Superintendent, Dave Sheahan every success and happiness in his new post

in Dublin and thanked him for all his hard work in Limerick during a very difficult time, especially in relation

to his success in tackling gangland crime.

Members voiced their concerns regarding the following issues :



Security staff in shops and businesses getting threatened on a regular basis and suggested that a

strategy be drawn up to address this serious issue and in doing so to work with security staff;



The use of high powered vehicles driving around thereby generating increased noise levels

especially in close proximity to residential areas;



Anti social behaviour in Mungret Park and Playground and asked that it be closely monitored

especially between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. each evening and during weekends and term

times ;



Anti social behaviour at Regional United Grounds;



Assaults taking place at night on Robert Street/Cruises Street/Market area and down near Penney’s

on O’Connell Street, drug use an issue;



Begging in the city centre becoming an increasing issue;



Widespread burglaries and in particular in Raheen/Dooradoyle area. Request update re application

for CCTV cameras for these areas;



Sulky racing in Mungret, Clarina and on Ballysimon Road;



Increasing problem of underage drinking;



Horse found dead next to halting site in Rhebogue. Request that the law re tagging of horses be

reinforced and a Guard appointed to liaise with the Council in relation to the horse situation in

Limerick;
---


Enforce the law re requirement for front and back lights on bicycles and cyclists wearing high viz

jackets;

Superintendant Smart replied as follows :



Five Gardai assigned to new operation to tackle criminal activity in the city centre and Cornmarket

Row, thefts, begging and assaults and a temporary security camera being installed at Cornmarket

Row. He also informed Members that he would increase patrols and have dogs on the street in the

Old Quarter area;



The new custody suite at Henry Street Garda Station not yet opened so when arrests are made they

have to be taken to Mayorstone Garda Station which is more time consuming. However, once the

new custody suite was opened it would speed up response times by Gardai when called to an

incident;



The Gardai actively targeting anti social behaviour and issuing ASBOS;



The Gardai would address the issue of high powered vehicles driving around especially near

residential areas;



He agreed to follow up on the issue of anti social behaviour at Regional United Club;



The problem of anti social behaviour in Mungret Park was the same as the problem experienced in

Thomondgate with young people who are under 18 years of age being dropped off by their parents

at the Park resulting in anti social behaviour and underage drinking. He confirmed that the Gardai

would monitor the situation;



He confirmed that burglaries increased at the turn of the year and in alot of cases the thieves were

from the area. The big issue was that people should ensure that their properties are locked up

properly and alarms turned on etc. when leaving the property;



Once a complaint was received by the Gardai in relation to sulky driving/racing the matter would

be followed up immediately;



Undercover operations take place on a regular basis to check that off licenses are not selling

alcohol to underage individuals. The Gardai actively target older teenagers buying alcohol for

younger children. He added that there was a huge parenting issue around this problem and agreed

to submit figures regarding same for the next meeting;



He confirmed that the Gardai liaise with the Council regarding the ongoing issue of horses and a lot

of work in relation to this matter was being carried out at night;



The Gardai stop cyclists who have no front or rear lights or a high vizz jacket and issue them with a

ticket fine;

Members also brought up the following issues :



Children kicking balls at cars at Springfield Shopping Centre;



Sulky riding in the middle of the road thereby slowing up traffic especially during rush hours and

referred specifically to the fact that sulky riding takes place every evening at 4.30 p.m. on Childers

Road;
---


The newly resurfaced Bloodmill Road now being used as a ‘rat run’ and drivers do not slow down at

the pedestrian crossing near the shops on Bloodmill Road and requested that the Go Safe Vans be

put into this area from time to time;



The sale of drugs on the Canal Bank to University of Limerick becoming a major issue with drug

dealers living locally and booking into the local hotel to do their business;



CCTV cameras in Gloster Lane had helped in addressing anti social behaviour in the Thomondgate

area however, would like to see the closure of Gloster Lane altogether ;



Illegal dumping of rubbish on Quarry Road despite CCTV cameras there;



The horse issue needs to be policed more and a tougher approach taken in addressing this

problem. Horses had been found in terrible condition and the Childers Road is being used as a

sulky track. Despite the allocation of half a million euro by the Council to address this problem the

situation is not improving. Would like to see how the issue is dealt with in other urban areas;



Problems experienced by the residents of Milford and Elm Park during Rag Week which is due to

commence in a weeks time and asked for increased police patrols during this period;

Superintendant Smart replied to the above issues raised by Members as follows :



The Gardai would look into the issue of anti social behaviour at Springfield shopping centre and the

problem of The Bloodmill Road being used as a rate run.



He confirmed that a Community Guard had been assigned to the halting site in Childers Road so

would ask him to follow up on the problem of sulky riding every evening on the Childers Road at

4.30 p.m;



He agreed to look at the issue of illegal dumping on Quarry Road;



He informed Members that An Garda Siochana run a Transition Programme in Henry Street for

teenagers showing them the consequence of crime and it was hoped that this would result in a

reduction in crime by teenagers and young people;



He confirmed that the Gardai meet with landlords and work with the University of Limerick in the

lead up to Rag Week and the Gardai specifically target housing estates where students are living

during Rag Week. He pointed out that there had been a decrease in the number of complaints over

the last year or two;

The Chairman, Councillor Sean Lynch stated that the next Metropolitan Joint Policing Sub Committee

Meeting would take place on 21st May, 2018 at 10.00 a.m. and if councillors had any questions or concerns

to submit same in advance of the meeting so that the Gardai would have answers to same for the meeting.

He added that the Head of CAB would be coming to Meeting and he said all councillors would be invited to

attend the meeting.

This concluded the meeting.

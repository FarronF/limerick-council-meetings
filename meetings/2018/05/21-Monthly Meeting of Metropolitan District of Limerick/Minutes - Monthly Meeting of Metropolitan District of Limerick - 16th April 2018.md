**QUESTIONS**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Hogan**

***I will ask at the*** ***next Meeting for an update on the extension of the Boardwalk from Arthur’s***

***Quay Park to King John’s Castle. The locked gates along the route at present mean that nobody***

***can enjoy the panoramic view of the Shannon River and Limerick City at certain hours.***

**REPLY:**

In 2007 the Transport Department of the Council produced The Limerick Riverside

Strategy and work commenced on upgrading the riverside walks and parks in the

City Centre. Projects completed include:

• Clancy Strand Riverside Upgrades and Robert Byrne Park

• New Clancy Strand Boardwalk

• O’Callaghan Strand Riverside Upgrades

• Condell road Riverside Walkway

• Upgrade of lighting and Standards on Sarsfield bridge

• The City Quays Riverside Upgrade and Boardwalk

At present there remains two important sections of the City Centre Riverside

upgrades to be completed and these include:

• The riverside from Sarsfield Bridge to King Johns Castle---
5

• Footpaths on the Three City Centre Bridges

Preliminary Plans for the upgrade of the riverside between Sarsfield Bridge and

King John’s Castle were prepared in 2013 but there was no funding available to

proceed with any works due to the economic downturn. These plans included

proposals to open up the Custom House Park at the rear of Sarsfield House and

The Hunt Museum with upgraded access routes to the riverside walk at the

western end of Sarsfield House, from Rutland Street and from the Milk Market.

These plans were largely overtaken in 2014 by proposals by the Council to develop

an iconic pedestrian Bridge in this area.

The Office of the Collector General and Sarsfield House operate the locked gates

at Sarsfield House. These gates, when locked restrict access to Custom House Park.

The Market Trustees (represented by the elected members of the Council under

the aegis of the Limerick Chamber of Commerce) operate the locked gates at The

Potato Market.

It was envisaged that these restrictions would be removed when the proposed new

works were undertaken.

As present, the Council has no short term plans to make any changes in this area.

The Council will review proposals to upgrade this riverside area and improving

access, security and enjoyment of the riverside.

As this is a riverside location these proposals will also be dependent on CFRAMS

proposals to upgrade flood protection and at this time the Council is awaiting

approval of the Limerick CFRAMS by the Minister for the OPW.

Works to upgrade the riverside walkways will have to be co-ordinated with the

provision of new flood protection measures to minimise disruption. Plans on these

matters should be developed over the next year or so.

Subject to funding being made available to the Council there are a number of short

term measures that could be considered, in consultation with relevant

stakeholders, to open up Custom House Park in advance of major upgrade works

and these include:

• Provide new LED Public Lighting and CCTV to Custom House Park

• Subject to agreement with Sarsfield House leave gateway at western end

permanently open

• Open up lane way between Rutland Street and Custom House Park in

agreement with Hunt Museum.

• Open up access from the Potato market end in agreement with the Market

Trustees

The Council will advance the longer-term plans for the upgrade of the riverside

public realm in this location and flood protection. It is hoped that this and other

worthy civic projects can be funded from the new Urban Regeneration Fund

announced by Government in the new National Development Plan 2018 to 2027.---

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the*** ***next Meeting if Limerick Fire Service has the appropriate, modern and up-to-***

***date fire fighting and rescue equipment, so as to safely rescue people that may become trapped***

***in a burning high rise buildings such as the 17 storey city hotel and the two 15 storey city centre***

***apartments.***

**REPLY:**

The fire strategy including evacuation for high rise buildings is mainly based on

robust fire safety design and construction methods. The primary emphasis on high

rise building design is to enable occupants to self rescue and firefighters to access

the fire floors to extinguish fires internally. High rise building design does not place

a dependence on the availability of fire service high reach platforms for firefighting

and rescue purposes.

Limerick Fire & Rescue Service has access to three number high reach appliances

in its own fleet and can also mobilise high reach appliances from neighbouring

brigades. The use of high reach appliances at an incident is weather dependent,

e.g. they cannot be used where cage wind speeds exceed 40km/h.

It is proposed that a targeted programme of fire safety inspections of high rise

buildings in Limerick City will be carried out before the end of 2018.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the*** ***next Meeting that this District considers identifying suitable development sites***

***for the construction of rapid build modular homes to help ease the pressures on our housing***

***lists now that a new manufacturing facility is being established in the City.***

**REPLY:**

LCCC have identified a number of sites that are suitable for Rapid Building

construction. Five sites with a potential housing delivery of 92 units are currently

being progressed. All of these sites have received approval from the Department

of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

LCCC welcome the establishment of a company in Limerick City specialising in off-

site construction. It is anticipated that this company will be successful and will

deliver housing nationally.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the*** ***next Meeting what contractor was appointed to carry out the Smarter Travel***

***works in Rhebogue, was it the same contractor as in Castletroy's Smarter Travel works, and was***

***a snag list done by Council staff before the contract was completed.***

**REPLY:**

The Limerick Smarter Travel – Rhebogue Neighbourhood Greenway project

involved the construction of tabletops at junctions, speed ramps, pavement and

footpath improvements, drainage works and additional lighting.

The tender was advertised nationally through the e-Tenders website. The

Procurement Regulations (and relevant EU Directives) were used to inform the

procurement process, including the development of Selection and Award criteria.---
7

Twelve tenders were received and the tender submitted by TBEB Ltd was the most

economically advantageous tender. On that basis, TBEB Ltd were appointed as

contractor for the Rhebogue project. A snag list was compiled by LCCC for the

works and the actions on this were completed by the contractor TBEB Ltd prior to

completion of the contract.

Wills Brothers Ltd were the contractors appointed to the Limerick Smarter Travel

Route 4 Castletroy and Newtown.

Following the junction improvements, a speed reduction of 23% was recorded on

the 85th percentile speed.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting at what stage is the Council at in developing a detailed plan for***

***promoting cycling and providing cycle lanes throughout the city, and can a report on this be***

***circulated to Elected Members.***

**REPLY:**

The Council are currently working with the National Transport Authority to develop

a Limerick Transport Strategy, which will be an integrated transport management

program for Limerick City and environs and will address current and future

transport requirements. This transport strategy will facilitate Limerick with an

opportunity to grow both physically and economically, offering better transport

choices and creating a public realm to be enjoyed by residents and visitors alike.

In relation to cycling, one of the main objectives in the strategy will be to provide

a safe and comfortable environment for cyclists in the city and surrounding area,

in turn increasing the number of cyclists and encouraging a greater model shift.

The strategy is intended to maximise the provision of high quality dedicated cycling

facilities, make cycling a priority and also extensive promotion of cycling as a

transport choice will be carried out to encourage an uptake in cycling both for

community and as a leisure activity.

The Limerick Transport Strategy will build on the good work already done by

Limerick Smarter Travel through the Limerick Metropolitan Cycle Network Study

and the Limerick Metropolitan Movement Framework Study. Funding for the

implementation of projects and promotions arising out of the Limerick Transport

Strategy is provided for in Project Ireland 2040, National Development Plan 2018-

2027 under sustainable mobility. As the development of the strategy progresses I

will arrange for presentations to be made to the Metropolitan District Council and

Transport SPC and inputs will be sought from elected members on the

development of this strategy.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a response to the following enquiry.***

***(i) Can you confirm that Limerick City and County Council are, or were in discussions, or***

***negotiations with the present owners of the Horizon Mall site, with regards it’s future plans and***

***use.***

***(ii) If the discussions have concluded, and a satisfactory conclusion was not agreed, when are***

***the owners of the site obliged to pay the Derelict Site Levies, now that the March 2018 deadline***

***has expired.***

***(iii) Are, or were the Derelict Site Levies suspended until the discussions reached a conclusion.***---
8

***(iv) Is the Horizon Mall site still on the Derelict Site list.***

**REPLY:**

A. Limerick City & County Council is currently having ongoing discussions with the

promoter to develop the site.

B. A Section 11 notice was issued under the Derelict Site Act in September 2017

requesting the owners to carry out necessary works. If the necessary works are not

carried out the next available option open under the Derelict Site Act 1990 is for

Limerick City & County Council to issue a Section 8(2) which states that it is our

intention to enter the property into the Derelict Sites Register.

C. The Derelict Site Levies are not applicable as the Horizon Mall site is not on the

Derelict Site Register at present.

D. The Horizon Mall site is still being dealt with under the Derelict Sites Legislation

but the site has not yet been progressed to the Derelict Site Register.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on Limerick City and County Council to***

***provide funding for artistic vision for the numerous utility and electricity boxes in the city and***

***suburbs in line with past funding for artistic enhancement of the electricity boxes in Upper***

***William Street and other areas around the city.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hogan and seconded by Councillor Hourigan.

Councillor Hogan outlined the background to this motion in relation to decorating the grey/green

boxes around the City.

**REPLY**:

This initiative was administered via the Property Department. Consultation with

stakeholders took place; the businesses, shops and premises near the relevant

utility and electricity boxes. The cost was €200 per box and materials, including an

anti-graffiti coating. This initiative would be possible; however, funding would have

to be identified, including the resources to manage it.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

Councillor Hurley outlined the background to the notice of motion and concerns regarding the

decrease in the fish stock and also the erosion of the river bank and the problems this is causing

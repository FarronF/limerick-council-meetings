The Deputy Chief Executive and Director, Economic Development, outlined the

statutory planning process that commenced in January 2018 and advised that, in making a

decision, Members must have due consideration to the report in relation to the planning

matters raised during the period of the consultation. He further stated that the Council must

focus, in making its decision, on the proper planning and development of the area and that,

without the adoption of the Variation of the Plan, the Limerick-Foynes Road, including the

by-pass of Adare, could not proceed to the detailed design and preparation for planning.

The A/ Senior Planner outlined the purpose of the Variation as follows:

 Update Chapter 8 of the County Development Plan to enable the design and

construction of the Foynes to Limerick Road.

 Amend the Objective in relation to the Adare By-Pass - the Plan currently referred to a

by-pass to the South (need to remove SOUTH – Adare Local Area Plan already had

similar Objective).

 Insert Objective for new road between N21 at Rathkeale and the N69 at Foynes.

 Insert Objective relating to enhanced connectivity between the N69 and Limerick

amended to include for the construction of the road, as Plan currently just referred to

examining sustainable route options.

The A/Senior Planner further stated that it was Important to note that there was no

road line in the Plan – the Variation only ensured policy support.

Members stated that they were In favour of Adare By-Pass but expressed

disappointment that following the Special Council Meeting held on 8th January, 2018, while

it was agreed that the economic impact on the Woodlands House Hotel would be

considered, this did not appear to have happened and there had been little interaction with

the Fitzgerald family in the interim. Members proposed that a decision on the Variation be

adjourned to allow engagement and discussion in relation to the issues raised.

The Director, Physical Development, confirmed that an Economist was appointed

and, as agreed at the Special Meeting, communications would be through the Consultants

and, following this, a number of emails had issued. However a reply was only received on 3rd

March.

Following further discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J), and

seconded by Councillor Galvin, that a Special Meeting would be held on Tuesday, 10th April,

2018, at 3pm, to further consider the matter. As not all Members were in favour of this

proposal, the Deputy Mayor directed that a vote be taken. It was agreed that the vote

would take the form of a show of hands. Following the vote, the Deputy Mayor declared

the proposal to hold a Special Meeting on 10th April, 2018, at 3pm, as carried.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many street signs, and Council road signs, have been**

there are signs in place, including estate nameplates and directional signs,

that do not fully conform with the Council’s policy on the use of Irish. An

developed for their replacement.

older signs which have been in place for a long number of years and do not

require their immediate replacement. They should, however, if being

replaced, meet the requirements as set out in the policy.

Condition 2 of the standard Letting Agreement signed by tenants provides as

follows:

"2. (A) The Tenant(s) shall furnish the Council with full particulars of present

income and the income of each person residing in the rented house and, in

addition, immediately notify the Council of any change in the income of any

resident in this house as soon as such changes occur and also furnish the

Council with all proofs which it may require in respect of any statement

made, and give the Council any authority which it may require to seek and

receive information regarding same from employers or from any other

source.

(B) In the event of the Tenant(s) failing to furnish the Council with the

information required, or to produce the proofs, or to give the authority

referred to, the Tenant(s) shall immediately become liable for and will pay

the full economic rent applicable to such house, or such rent as shall be fixed

by the Council at its discretion, from the next date that the rent is due

following the date upon which such change of circumstances occurred."

Periodically, the practice has been to send out rent assessment forms to all

tenants in order to get an accurate picture at a particular point in time of the

household income and composition, and calculate and implement any rent

changes arising therefrom. The last such general exercise took place in 2011.

It is accepted that it is desirable to do this on a more regular basis. Given the

scale of the project, involving circa 5000 households, it is not possible to

commit to undertake this exercise on an annual basis. It is the intention of

Limerick City and County Council that all households would be assessed at

least once every two years. However, it is important to emphasise that the

tenants are required, under the letting agreement, to notify the Council of

any change to their income status.

NOTICES OF MOTION

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan

**I will move at the next Meeting that, as Limerick Twenty Thirtyis a solely owned company**

**of this Council, (a) no contracts be entered into, and no land or property be acquired,**

**without the expressed permission of the Council; (b) the company make a presentation to**

**the Council at least twice a year; and (c) a statement of accounts be issued in conjunction**

**with the Budget every year.**

Councillor Gilligan, in proposing the Motion, outlined the background and stated

that his understanding was that Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC was set up to assist with the

commercial development of the City. However, it appeared to him that the purchase of the

land on the North Circular Road now made the Company a property developer. He also

expressed disappointment that the Members learned of this purchase in the local press.

The Motion was seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

The Chief Executive informed the Meeting that the former Salesian Secondary School

and Convent Site at Fernbank, North Circular Road, Limerick, was purchased by the Council

and not Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC, in accordance with normal protocols for acquisition of

property. The Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Economic Development added that

the Company acted in the interest of the Council and was tasked with delivering projects

identified in Limerick 2030 - an Economic and Spatial Plan for Limerick. The Chief Executive

stated that the first part of the Motion was not legally possible as Limerick Twenty Thirty

DAC is a separate legal entity.

**REPLY:**

Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC (100% owned by Council) is a separate legal

entity and a distinct body in law, which is tasked to undertake strategic

development activity on behalf of the Council as part of the Limerick 2030

Economic and Spatial Strategy. In relation to any property owned by the

Council, any disposal by the Council, or Lease for a period in excess of twelve

(12) months, requires a resolution to be passed, pursuant to Section 183 of

the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended. The acquisition of a property

by the Council or Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC does not require any such

Resolution.

The Council Members have approved the funding for the Opera Site as a

Reserved Function pursuant to Section 106 of the Local Government Act. In

relation to future funding provided by the Council to Limerick Twenty Thirty,

on receipt of same they may expend the monies received as they decide,

subject to the qualification that they must use the funds in general terms for

the purpose for which they were advanced by the Council. The details of how

they actually use the funding, within the confines of the previous

qualification, are a matter for Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC. In addition, the

company adheres to a strict governance regime and is subject to all auditing

requirements to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Council.

Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC will provide regular updates to the Council and a

summary of all Limerick City and County Council Associated Companies’ most

recent financial statements are included under Appendix 8 of the Annual

Financial Statements.

In the absence of Councillor Scanlan, this Motion was deferred.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

**I will Move at the next Meeting that a visual inspection is carried out on the streetscapes**

**of all our county towns, in the critical interest of public health and safety, by Limerick City**

**and County Council Engineers, to establish the condition of the buildings that make up our**

**towns. Many of the buildings in our towns are derelict, vacant, and in poor states of**

**repair.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donoghue referred to the buildings in towns

and villages that had been vacant over a long period and were now becoming derelict, and

the need to take action to prevent the ongoing deterioration of many towns and villages in

the county. He further suggested that one of the barriers to redevelopment was restrictions

in relation to conservation and consideration should be given to carrying out conversation

reports on many of these buildings in order to identify what needed to be done to bring

them back into use.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Donegan.

Members referred to existing schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal

Scheme, Green Towns and painting schemes and also the establishment of the Urban and

Village Renewal Department as measures that could assist in dealing with vacant and

derelict buildings in towns and villages. Members welcomed the establishment of this Unit

and also referred to the need to look at streets in the City Centre, as well as in the towns

and village. Recent schemes such as the Gaol Lane Development were welcomed. However,

concern was expressed in relation to anti-social behaviour around Johnsgate Village.

The A/Director, Social Development, stated that the fabric of the towns and villages

was very important and he outlined a number of housing schemes aimed at vacant

property, including ‘Buy and Renew’ and ‘Repair and Lease.’  He further advised that public

notices advertising these schemes and seeking suitable properties had been placed in local

newspapers that week.

**REPLY:**

A new Urban and Village Renewal Department was established within the

Service Operations Directorate in October 2017. There are now five

staff members carrying out inspections across Limerick City and County in

order to identify vacant sites, vacant homes, vacant commercial property and

derelict sites.

The objective is to achieve a significant reduction in vacancy and dereliction

through working with the owners of these properties and/or exercising the

various legislative powers available to the Council.

In instances where a dangerous building is identified as part of this inspection

process, these cases are dealt with by engineers within the Planning and

Environmental Services Department under the Local Government Sanitary

Service Act, 1964.

It is intended to organise a briefing for Elected Members in each District in

the near future to outline progress to date on derelict and vacant property.

Following further discussion, Members noted the Reply and welcomed the fact that

the new Urban and Village Renewal Department would be briefing Elected Members in each

District in the near future.

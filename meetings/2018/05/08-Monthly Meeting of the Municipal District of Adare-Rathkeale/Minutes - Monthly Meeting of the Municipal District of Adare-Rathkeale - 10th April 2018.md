which have been severly damaged as a result of the severe weather conditions. This

was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

Councillor O’Brien referred to the ongoing issue of the construction of a new slipway at

Ringmoylan pier and informed Members that a grant had been received from the

Department of Agruiculture, Food & Marine to carry out this work.

Pallaskenry raised at the March Meeting of the District. Members were all in agreement

this work should not be the responsibility of the landowner to carry out necessary

repairs as this is a shared boundary wall between the Council and landowner and

requested a report on same for next Meeting.

Councillor Teskey was anxious more funding should be made available to farmers in

West Limerick due to the fodder crisis and farmers should also be made aware they can

contact their local representatives for assistance on this matter.

briefing session to discuss current actions as regards social and Affordable Housing

and also the various aspects of the Housing programme.

 Councillor Teskey expressed his thanks to all volunteers involved in the recent Team

Limerick Cleanup (TLC). He also raised the issue of the alarming amount of household

rubbish that is dumped on the roadsides and wondered if instead of a standard fine

being issued could the perpetrators be persued through the judicial system.

can only be brought if evidence of the illegal dumping is provided.

Members discussed the possibility of employing temporary Litter Wardens to focus

their attention on dumping black spots and also wondered if a programme could be

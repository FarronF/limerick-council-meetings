NOTICES OF MOTION

6. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell

! will move at the next Meeting that an Overseer investigate blocked gulleys, shores,
manholes and potholes and disrepair, along with any other risks, including trees and litter,
which may be a danger to traffic and all road users, along with mapping of all future and
past gulleys, culverts and shores; this work to be carried out on an ongoing basis so as to
notify and alert the Local Authority and the Elected Members of any impending danger.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Mitchell and seconded by Councillor
O’Donnell

REPLY: Routine roads maintenance in the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock
is divided into two operational areas - Operations North, based in the
Annacotty Depot, and Operations South, based in Kilmallock. Each operational
area has a Roads Engineer who is responsible for the maintenance of the road
network, including the investigation and resolution of blocked gullies, repair of
potholes and other roads-related problems. The Roads Engineers are also
assisted by 4 Roads Supervisors in investigating and resolving routine drainage
problems and repair of potholes.

The Sugar CRM system is increasingly being used by Elected Members and the
public to report potholes and blocked gullies and the Sugar CRM system
provides a mechanism for updating the Elected Members and public of
progress in resolving roads-related problems. All of the information garnered
from the various sources is then used to assist in the response to issues arising
and in the preparation of a planned roads programme for the Municipal
District.

Members expressed their concern that local knowledge could be lost and it was
considered that a system was required in order to maintain same.
7. Notice of Motion submitted by Co W. O’Donnell

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council carry out a review of
the Bruff Local Area Plan to include re-zoning of lands for residential development which

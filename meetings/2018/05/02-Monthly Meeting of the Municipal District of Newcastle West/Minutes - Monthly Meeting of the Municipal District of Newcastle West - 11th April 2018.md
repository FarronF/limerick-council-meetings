Deputation

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Tournafulla/Mountcollins Parish Finance

Committee, and noted the procedures for receiving delegations. The Deputation consisted of

Fr. Denis Mullane, Ms. Eileen Moroney, and Mr. Johnny Walsh.

Fr. Denis Mullane addressed the Meeting and stated in 2014 a piece of ground for a graveyard

became available for purchase but it was felt at the time that this site was too expensive. He

stated that another site of 1.7 acres had now become available and the cost involved is

reasonable. He also stated that the landowner in question is willing to provide a right of way

for the graveyard and Mr. Walsh outlined that the proposed site is adjacent to the Old

Cemetery. Fr. Mullane asked if the Council could assist with determining if the site is suitable

for a graveyard.

In response, the Director of Services stated that this matter was raised previously and that

the proposed new site would have to be tested. Also a more detailed survey of the existing

graveyard would be required to ascertain the number of sites remaining. He also stated that

the best way to progress this matter would be to have a Meeting with the Parish Finance

Committee and the Council and this is to be arranged.

The Members thanked Fr. Mullane and the delegation for their attendance.

QUESTIONS

5.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the junctions on the N21.***

REPLY:

Following a presentation to the Newcastle West Municipal District Meeting

last December, it was agreed that six of the 15 junctions between the Killarney

Pole to the County boundary would be prioritised with respect to a submission

for funding to TII. The six junctions are:

N21/L7091 Wards Cross
---
4

N21/L7056 Tullig/Forge Cross

N21/L7055 Glantine GAA

N21/L7058 Dunakenna

N21/R576 Brosna-Rock

N21/L7093 Dromtrasna

A letter was issued to TII in January requesting a funding allocation to carry out

more detailed surveys and designs for the introduction of right turn lanes at

the junctions listed above.

TII replied to the Council’s request for funding on the 16th March. A copy of

their correspondence is attached.

In summary, they have indicated that there is one junction that merits further

investigation based on their most recent analysis of High Collision locations.

The junction that they are referring to is the N21/L7091 Junction Wards Cross.

They will be requesting Limerick City and County Council to design an

appropriate scheme to deal with safety issues at Wards Cross, carry out an

economic appraisal of any proposed works, fully cost the scheme and submit

it to them for approval.

They have also indicated that while the other junctions have not been

identified in their most recent list of High Collision Locations, it does not

preclude the Council from submitting a feasibility report for safety

improvements at other locations. The preparation of these other feasibility

reports would not be funded by TII. To progress with more detailed surveys

and designs for the introduction of right turn lanes at the other locations would

require significant resources to be invested on the Council’s part. These

resources are not available at present. The Council’s technical staff will

however work with TII on developing safety improvements at Wards Cross.

beginning to change its course. It was also raised that trees along the course of the river could

be dislodged and potentially damage the Feale Bridge. They also referred to the works carried

out by Irish Water near the Water Treatment Plant. Reference was also made to the OPW

Voluntary Home Relocation Scheme, which only dealt with householders who experienced

flooding and not erosion issues. It was also noted that Members should contact local TDs

At the outset of the Meeting Councillor Sheahan proposed standing orders be amended

in order to discuss suitable dates and times for the holding of a civic reception for the

District to honour local sports people for their recent achievements in sport in the

County. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Teskey.

It was also proposed should there be no reception in Merchants Quay to honour the

players of the Limerick team on their success in the All Ireland hurling final one should

be held in Rathkeale. It was agreed to follow this up with Corporate staff in City Hall to

ascertain whether or not a reception was being held for the team.

**Kilscannell Graveyard**

Councillor Teskey outlined the position with Kilscannell Burial Ground saying

correspondence had been issued from the Council to the owners of burial plots at

Kilscannell Burial Ground. He went on to say this is a very sensitive matter and

distressing to all involved. He enquired if the Senior Executive Technician had liaised

with the Church of Ireland body for the Limerick region with a view to taking over the

burial ground at Kilscannell. Councillor Teskey asked if the Council did take over the

Burial Ground what they proposed to do with it? Comparisons were made by the

elected Members with Kilscannell and similar issues that have arisen with Clonshire

Burial Ground. The Senior Executive Technician circulated a report to Members which

stated the Church structure which is in a derelict state and in 2010 it was deemed a

matter of health and safety with temporary constraints being erected on site. In June

2018 a letter was sent to people who have burial plots in the fenced off area of

Kilscannell Graveyard stating that if Limerick City and County Council had not heard from

them by the end of the month an alternative burial plot would be reassigned to them.

Councillor Teskey felt because this is such a delicate situation Limerick City and County

Council should consider this when writing to people who own the grave spaces.

The Senior Executive Technician informed Members that the Church of Ireland are

willing to transfer the burial ground to Limerick City and County Council and he

circulated a report from Malachy Walsh and Partners Consulting Engineers dated 18th

June, 2010 outlining the details of works to be carried out on site and an estimated cost

which would make the site safe. The Senior Executive Technician informed members

these costs would be considerably more now in 2018. Funding was applied for at the

time from the Department of Heritage to carry out these works, however, this was not

forthcoming. Limerick City and County Council had in the interest of health and safety

to erect scaffolding to carry out works to make the pinnacles of the structure safe.

Following discussion Members agreed the money used to hire scaffolding at that time

should have been put towards the hire of a crane to remove the pinnacles. Members

also requested the costing of the scaffolding erected in 2010 be made available for the

October Monthly Meeting.

From the report Members noted there were a number of unoccupied burial plots in

Kilscannell. The Senior Executive Technician informed Members this was only realised

when they were carrying out a survey of the burial ground. At present there are three

plots together and two single plots available. Councillor Teskey asked if Limerick City

and County Council could write to the families affected at the present time and offer

them first refusal of these unoccupied burial plots. All Members expressed concern

given the number of “live graves” in Kilscannell and the fact that people are being

prevented from using same. Members agreed a common sense approach was needed to

carry out the necessary repair works until funding becomes available to complete all the

work required at Kilscannell.

This concluded the Meeting.

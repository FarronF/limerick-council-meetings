QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting what is the remaining sewerage capacity in the Waste Water***

***Treatment Plants in each of the following villages (a) Athea (b) Tournafulla (c) Mountcollins***

***(d) Templeglantine (e) Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

Councillor

Galvin’s

question

was

referred

to

Irish

Water

on

localrepsupport@water.ie. See below the response received.

Mountcollins, Templeglantine and Tournafulla are all Certificate of

Authorisation sites. The capacity and performance of the 500+ Certificate of

Authorisation sites across the county are being assessed by Irish Water. Based

on available information the loads and capacities of the 3 COA sites in question

are shown below:

**Waste**

**Water**

**Treatment**

**Plant (WWTP)**

**Comment**

Athea

Athea is a Wastewater Discharge Authorisation site.

Athea WWTP receives a load of 490 PE and the WWTP is

currently being upgraded from primary treatment to a 600

PE secondary treatment WWTP with the provision of a

future extension to 900 PE. Based on the current loading

the upgraded WWTP will have 110 PE space capacity when

upgrade completed.

Tournafulla

Tournafulla is serviced by 2 no. separate WWTPs. WWTP

No. 1 at the western end of the village and WWTP No. 2 at

the eastern end of the village. Based on the 2016 Census

the total connected residential population is 85 PE and the

potential load including the school is higher. The design---
4

capacity of the individual WWTPs and load split between

both is not known at this time. However based on effluent

sampling results WWTP No. 1 may be overloaded.

Mountcollins

Mountcollins WWTP has a reported design capacity of 453

PE and receives a load of 300 PE leaving 153 PE spare

capacity available.

Templeglantine Templeglantine WWTP has a reported design capacity of

112 PE. Based on the 2016 Census the connected

residential population is 67 PE.

Abbeyfeale

Abbeyfeale is a Wastewater Discharge Authorisation Site.

The 2,860 PE design capacity Abbeyfeale Waste Water

Treatment Plant (WWTP) currently receives a load of

2,793 PE leaving 67 PE spare capacity available.

Please note anyone who wishes to enquire about the feasibility of connecting to the Irish

Water networks can submit a pre-connection enquiry to Irish Water; on receipt of a

submission, we will complete an assessment and issue a response. For more information, see

www.water.ie/connections.

Councillor Galvin queried the above response and stated that difficulty had arisen in obtaining

planning permission in the villages of Tournafulla and Mountcollins as there is no capacity in

the existing waste water treatment plants to cater for additional connections. Following

further discussion, it was agreed that a Meeting be requested with Irish Water regarding this

matter.

5.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed report on upgrade works for Wards Cross and***

***Devon Cross on the N21.***

REPLY:

Wards Cross has been identified as a HD15 site by the TII in 2018. HD15 is a

Network Safety Ranking system, which is the process of using collision data to

rank the safety of the national road network and to identify high collision

locations. Currently the TII are completing works on HD15 sites identified in

2017 and will then commence works on the 2018 sites.

Devon Cross has been identified as a HD17 site by the TII following a road

safety inspection on the N21. HD17 inspections are road safety inspections

which are performed on existing national roads to identify safety issues and

defects that require maintenance. This junction along with other hazards

identified on the N21 and indeed on all other National roads within Limerick

will be assessed for suitable improvement works over the next few months.---

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

any subsequent work on the refurbishment of the property cannot take place

until the house has been transferred to the Council.

REPLY**:**

The Notice of Motion as submitted by Councillor Michael Collins was referred

to Irish Water at localrepsupport@water.ie. Please see response from Irish

Water:

Irish Water & Limerick City & County Council have investigated this issue at

length. The source of the hydrocarbons that are present at low levels in the

water in O’Connor Park has not been found to date, however, it is suspected

to be entering the pipework from contaminated ground, possibly within the

Park itself. The water leaving Irish Water’s treatment plant does not contain

these hydrocarbons.

Further flushing of the mains and analysis of the water will be undertaken in

the coming weeks.

Cllr. Collins stated that he was unhappy with the response and requested that a meeting be

arranged with Irish Water regarding the water quality at O’Connor Park, Ardagh.---

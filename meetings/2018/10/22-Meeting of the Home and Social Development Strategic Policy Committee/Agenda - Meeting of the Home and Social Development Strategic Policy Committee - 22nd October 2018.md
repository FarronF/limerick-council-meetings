I will move at the next meeting that, Limerick City and County Council provide additional

maintenance funding to facilitate the immediate response to outstanding requests from

tenants of Council owned houses. Repairs considered essential have been left

unresolved for a number of years due to lack of funding allocation. This is specifically

highlighted in the number of houses awaiting window and door replacement.

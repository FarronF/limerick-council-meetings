**Proposed Castletroy Local Area Plan 2019 - 2025**

In relation to the submissions number 38 & 45 Councillor M. Sheahan requested clarification on

the legal proposal in relation to the zoning of these lands. The Acting Senior Planner indicated

that following receipt of legal advice that the proposal to extend the planned boundary beyond

that which had gone on public display would be a contravention of Section 19 of the Planning and

Development Act 2000 (as Amended) and the legal requirement for the Local Area Plan to be

consistent with the County Development Plan. The Acting Senior Planner confirmed that this

change would represent a fundamental change rather than a material alteration and would

undermine the process.

On the proposal of Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor M. Sheahan, it was agreed to make

the Castletroy Local Area Plan in accordance with the Draft Local Area Plan, the Chief Executive’s

recommendations and the following amendments;

(1) That Tom O’Connor’s land listed as submission no 51 to the Draft Plan is zoned for residential

use Phase 2 and changes are made to the land use zoning map to amend this zoning from---
2

agricultural to residential phase 2 use.

Reason given: The site sits within the plan boundary for Castletroy and will consolidate the

development of the area. The development of the site is considered necessary as a response

to meeting housing need in the current climate of housing shortage.

On the proposal of Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor Crowley, the following amendment

was proposed:

(2) To include an objective for the provision of a burial ground in the Castletroy area.

Reason given: In the interest of sustainable development and to support the needs of a

growing community in Castletroy.

On the proposal of Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Crowley the following amendment

was proposed:

(3) That the Transport and Amenity Map C-19/25-03 is amended to reflect the existing and

proposed network of walkways and cycleways in Castletroy and takes into account recent

upgrade works to the network. This includes works on Walkers Road, networks through lands

adjacent to Walkers Road, the L1121, Golf Links Road and the L1171.

Reason given: In the interest of clarity and to ensure permeability throughout the plan area.

A map outlining the changes was submitted.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O’Dea the following amendment

was proposed:

(4) Proposed that objective PV04 residential development, is amended to provide for 48% of the

site area for residential development rather than 15%. Chapters 3, 4 & 11 shall also be

amended to reflect this change in terms of the amount of land zoned, densities and associated

population growth. Text in section 10.4.3 shall also be amended as follows:

Omit *“an element of residential use in this employment zoned area maybe considered” and*

*replace with “The principal use of this site shall be for employment creation with associated*

*residential use”.*

Reason given: The Parkway Valley site is a prime example of a brownfield site as set out in the

National Planning Framework and is unique in the context of Limerick in that it sits at a

strategic location along the regional route corridor within close proximity to the City Centre.

The redevelopment of the site is considered a priority given its inclusion on the derelict sites

register and the fact it has remained vacant and derelict since 2009. Its redevelopment is

considered necessary as a response to meeting housing need in the current climate of housing

shortage. The additional population accommodated at this site will form part of the cities

allocated growth of 28,000 up to 2040.---

On the proposal of Councillor Prendiville, seconded by Councillor Keller the following amendment

was proposed:

(5) Under Objective PV08: Provision of Community Facilities, include the following - Adequate

provisions shall be made for social and community facilities within the site, to accommodate

existing and future residents. Provision shall be made for childcare facilities, playground and

leisure facilities suitable for a range of age groups including walking/jogging paths and

community meeting space.

Reason given: In order to ensure that adequate community facilities are provided to meet the

growing demand.

On the proposal of Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor O’Dea the following amendment was

proposed:

(6) That the proposed pedestrian route from Dublin Road to Caislean na hAbhainn be omitted.

Reason given: Walkways and cycle lanes should be provided where there is greater visibility to

ensure their safety and should not be provided at the back of housing estates.

A map outlining the changes was submitted.

The following resolution was passed.

“That in accordance with Section 20 of the Planning and Development 2000 Act (as amended) the

proposed Local Area Plan is made in accordance with the Draft published on the 19th May, the

Chief Executive’s report and subject to the amendments proposed at this meeting”.

The Acting Senior Planner then indicated that the amendments will be placed on public display

for a 4 week period and submissions can only be made on the amendments. Following this public

display period a second Chief Executive’s report will be brought before the Metropolitan District

meeting for consideration.

The Deputy Mayor requested a show of hands and 14 were in favour and 4 against.

This concluded the Meeting.

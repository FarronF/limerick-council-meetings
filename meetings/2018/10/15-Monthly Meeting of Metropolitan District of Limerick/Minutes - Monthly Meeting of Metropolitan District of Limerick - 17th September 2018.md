***Bloodmill Road will begin and be completed.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is currently in discussions with landowners in the

**8.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting how many houses are due to be knocked, refurbished, or built in***

***each of Limerick's Regeneration areas in 2018 and 2019.***

**REPLY**:

1.

Demolition Programme

The timing of the demolition of each house scheduled for demolition in accordance

with the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) is

determined on a case by case basis as a number are occupied and in private

ownership. Therefore, the number to be demolished to date in 2018 and 2019

cannot be confirmed. Two houses have been demolished to date in 2018 with

thirteen currently scheduled for demolition prior to year-end.

2.

Refurbishment Programme

All houses not scheduled for demolition in the Regeneration areas either have

been or will be refurbished in accordance with the LRFIP. Under the Thermal

Upgrade Programme 1,169 are complete or in progress (783 completed and 386

under construction) and 290 are being advanced. In addition to the Thermal

Upgrade Programme, major refurbishment of local authority unoccupied ‘Voids’

and ‘Derelicts’ has taken place e.g. 1 – 3 Weston Gardens, 8 – 10 Gaol Lane, etc.

3.

New Build Construction Programme

The number of new build homes to be constructed under the LRFIP, approved in

2014, is 593. This number reduced to 549 following a review in 2016 of the

Demolition and Retention Strategy which resulted in a greater number of homes

being retained. The number of new build homes constructed is 250 (as at 12th

September, 2018). Therefore the programme is 45% complete. The overall

completion date is 2023 in line with the 10 year programme set out in the LRFIP

adopted in 2014. The above figure excludes major refurbishment of derelict

houses such as 8 – 10 Gaol Lane, 1-3 Weston Gardens, etc. which while delivering

‘new’ units are classified as ‘Derelicts’/Rebuilds. The number of new build houses

constructed in 2018 to date is 42 with the total projection for 2018 of 61. These

are broken down as follows: 42 – Southill and 19 – St. Mary’s Park.

**REPLY:**

LCCC are very supportive of the establishment of a Company manufacturing rapid

build-type homes in Limerick.

In the context of Rebuilding Ireland there is potential for this company to become

**Item 2**

Metropolitan District of Limerick on the 21st of May 2018.

Notice of motion submitted by Cllr D. Butler

“I call at the next meeting of Limerick City and County Council to develop a database

of information on the reasons behind business closure in the city in order to inform

the development of a more effective policy of supporting city centre business.”

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Cllr Daniel Butler and seconded by Cllr

Seighin O’Ceallaigh.  The members supported the thrust of the motion and were

concerned that the city centre was not performing as it could to support sustainable

business, particularly retail. It was agreed that the motion would be amended to

read as follows;

*“**That Limerick City and County Council conducts consultation and research on the*

*reasons behind business closure in the City and County in order to inform the*

*development of a more effective policy of supporting City centre and County*

*business.”*

It was agreed that the revised motion should be referred back to the full Council for

consideration and ratification.

**Item 3**

**Presentation on Regional Skills.**

Members received a presentation on Regional Skills by the Regional Skills Co-

ordinator, Mr. J. Leddin. The presentation covered the following areas;---
 National Context

 Skills Strategy

 Skills Eco-system

 Work of the Regional Sills Forum

 Why should education and Industry collaborate

 PWC HR Survey 2017

 Implications on future skill needs

 Value Proposition

 Employer Role

 Responding to Skill Needs

 Strategic Initiatives

 Mid-West Apprenticeships App

 Employment Projections 2018

The members welcomed the presentation. Regional skills provide a structure for

employers and the Further Education/Higher Education systems to work together.

Unique selling points for the Mid-West have been identified as quality of life, lack of

congestion, education institutions, and affordable housing. The focus has changed

from catering for those seeking employment to those already in employment. As a

response to skill needs, there is a number of further education opportunities

available in Limerick.

New apprenticeship programmes are being launched following extensive

participation to deliver new skills required to enable companies to remain innovative

and competitive. This is a new model whereby the individual will be an employee of

the company, therefore addressing the issue of employment security.

Currently up to 50% of advertised jobs are in the STEM area. Introduction to STEM

needs to be incorporated into primary school level with particular emphasis on

female participation.

**Item 4**

**Presentation from the Shannon Region Conference and Sports Bureau.**

Members received a presentation from Ms Karen Brosnahan, SRCSB.

The presentation covered the following issues;

 Public Private Partnership Model

 Service Level Agreement with Failte Ireland

 Limerick City Office

 Two full time employees

 Partnership approach to winning business and sports tourism

Members welcomed the presentation. It was stressed by members that Limerick

needed a conference centre/multiuse venue of scale. Currently Limerick cannot bid

for large scale events due to the lack of a large, year round venue. Members also

raised the issue of elected member participation on the board of the Bureau. There

was a consensus that Limerick needed another hotel to meet rising demand.

**Item 5**

**AOB Notice of Motion from Cllr. K. Sheahan**---
With the permission of the Chairperson, the following Notice of Motion was

discussed.

*‘That this Committee would call on the Taoiseach and his government to legislate to*

*ensure that employees who have a recognised degree would be legally entitled to be*

*paid a liveable wage and that their employers would not obstruct these graduates*

*from being in pensionable and unionised jobs, and that this recommendation be*

*circulated for each Local Authority in the country, and to the MGMA and the AILG**’**.*

There was general support for the proposal from the members and after some

discussion, it was agreed to refer it to the full Council for consideration.

This concluded the business of the meeting

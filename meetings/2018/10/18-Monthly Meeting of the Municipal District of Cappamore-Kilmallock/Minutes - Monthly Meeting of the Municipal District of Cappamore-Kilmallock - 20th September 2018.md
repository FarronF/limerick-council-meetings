QUESTIONS
4. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

1 will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the traffic calming measures being
implemented at Lynch’s bend in Ballygibba, Kilmallock.

REPLY: Limerick City & County Council will carry out improvement works to the
existing road surface and white lining at Lynch’s bend. The Council has

location. This will be followed by the renewal of the white lines.

The works are expected to be carried out by 15"" October 2018, subject to
suitable weather conditions.

5. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

| will ask at the next Meeting

¢ How many vacant local authority houses in the Cappamore-Kilmallock
Municipal District;

e How long are they vacant;

¢ Is the funding in place to carry out the required works on these voids?

REPLY: (a) There are currently thirteen vacant Local Authority houses in the
Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District. Two of these houses are receiving
final upgrade renovation works and have tenants allocated to these houses. A
further three of the thirteen houses are currently ready for tenants and are
awaiting acceptance.

(b) Of the thirteen properties in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District,
four have been vacant for less than six months, four have been vacant for
between six and twelve months, and five have been vacant for between
twelve and twenty four months.

(c) Funding has been approved for all valid voids works on the remaining
properties and works will commence without undue delay.

The Members expressed their disappointment that some vacant local authority houses had
still not been repaired and re-allocated, having been vacant for between twelve and twenty
four months. They stressed the importance Of capital funding being made available by the
Department to repair these long term voids, having regard to the housing crisis currently
being experienced nationally.

The Members also agreed that consideration should be given to purchase more houses in
the Municipal District as this would be a quicker way of housing provision in the District.

6. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for an
update on the works to be carried out at the new extension to Caherconlish Graveyard.

REPLY: It was the intention to tender this project out for construction in the spring of
2018. In March 2018, the Electricity Supply Board made contact with Limerick
City & County Council, offering to take down and bury the existing over
ground three-phase power line between the old and new burial grounds, as


---

they were doing works in an adjacent property. By doing so, it would both
visually enhance the boundary between both the existing and new
graveyards and have the potential of providing additional new burial spaces.

The ESB also suggested that they would make contact with the adjacent
church (Our Lady, Mother of the Church, Caherconlish) with the option of
burying the power line that traverses over their property. This has only
recently been resolved between the Church and the ESB.

At present, our Consulting Engineers are amending the tender documents to
incorporate the changes required with the assistance of the ESB. It is
expected the contract will go to tender before the end of 2018 and
construction to commence in spring of 2019, subject to the approval of the
Council.

Te uesti illor O’Donnell

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on current enforcement action taken by
Limerick City & County Council in relation to derelict buildings in the Municipal District.

Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock.

There are 67 open cases on Sugar CRM in relation to derelict properties in the
Cappamore-Kilmallock area. These cases are in progress and the properties

In common with all housing estates in Kilmallock, the Council will erect 30
kph signs at Millmount Estate following approval of the Speed Limit Byelaws
in late 2018.

further measures such as speed ramps are required, and provides a protocol
for assessing and prioritising schemes and includes factors such as:

Accident history
Speed

Vulnerable road users
Traffic Volumes

Local Conditions
Through Road

The provision of traffic calming measures is often a contentious issue with
residents, Consequently, the Policy requires a plebiscite of residents in which
two thirds of the residents on the street affected have indicated that they are
in favour of the proposed measures. Any such plebiscite shall be restricted to
residents living within 100 meters of the location of the proposed traffic
calming measures.

The Members noted the reply to the Question and a general discussion took place in
relation to speed ramps and the appropriate use of same. The A/Senior Executive Engineer,
Cappamore-Kilmallock agreed to do a briefing for the Members on the policy document
‘Limerick City and County Council Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas’ at the next
Municipal District Meeting.

Graveyard, Pallasgreen, where there is water lodging in a section of the graveyard causing
flooding there.

REPLY: On foot of representations received regarding a localised surface water
drainage issue within the burial ground. Limerick City & County Council has
assessed the drainage issue along with the deleterious condition of the

existing footpaths and decided to install new surface water drainage in the

Other Matters Raised:

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the
following items were raised:

¢ Opening of Kilmallock West Wall Walkway and Footbridge

The Members noted that a date had been fixed for the Official Opening but expressed
disappointment that the proposed date and time would clash with another prior engagement
scheduled in Oola later on the same day.

The Director noted that completion of the West Wall Walkway and Footbridge was a welcome
addition to Kilmallock and that it was important to mark the opening of same, but agreed to
work with the Cathaoirleach to see if alternative options could be considered having regard
to the clash of engagements on the day.

The Members complimented Council staff and the contractors who worked on these projects,
and in particular Sarah McCutcheon, Executive Archaeologist for her ongoing work in
Kilmallock on the Walled Town project.

¢ School Bus Scheme

The Members expressed their disappointment at the fact that approximately 25 students of
Hospital Secondary Schoo! were unable to secure places on school buses, which was placing
undue hardship and stress on parents and students, at the start of a new school term.

The Members agreed that the Municipal District would write to both Bus Eireann and Minister
John Halligan, who as Minister for State had school transport as one of his Ministerial

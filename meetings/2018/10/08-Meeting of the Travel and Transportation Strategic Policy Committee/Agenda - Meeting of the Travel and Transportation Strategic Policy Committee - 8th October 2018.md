“I will move at the next meeting that efforts be made to include the refurbishment
and re-opening of the Black Bridge in any plans for a Greenway/Cycleway along the
river Shannon.”

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

“I will move at the next Meeting that the Council install, without delay, traffic
calming measures in all towns and villages in County Limerick where there is a lack of
Garda presence due to the shortage of Gardai and the closure of local stations. In

indicators, ramps and other traffic calming measures are urgently needed as is clear
from the fatalities, near misses and traffic issues in the towns and villages of County
Limerick.”

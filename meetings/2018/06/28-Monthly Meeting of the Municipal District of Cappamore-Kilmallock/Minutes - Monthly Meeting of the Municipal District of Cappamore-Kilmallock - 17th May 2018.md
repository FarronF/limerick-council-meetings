QUESTIONS

3.

Question submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell

***I will ask at the next Meeting what impact the new General Data Protection Regulations***

***(GDPR) will have on CCTV monitoring proposals in the Municipal District of Cappamore-***

***Kilmallock.***

**REPLY:**

We are still awaiting legal advice on this issue. However, we are in the process

of reviewing and updating our Data Protection Policy and the CCTV Policy to

introduce enhanced controls and procedures in line with GDPR. We aim to

have a full report at the next Council meeting.

The Elected Members expressed disappointment at the delay in the introduction of CCTV

cameras in the District because of delays in getting legal advice, especially having regard to

the fact that the new GDPR changes were being introduced on the 25th May, 2018. However

they also noted from the reply that a full report would be presented at the next Council

meeting.

4.

Question submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell

***I will ask at the next Meeting that some green margins be removed on local back and side***

***roads to facilitate pedestrians, walkers, cyclists, vehicles and all road users to make them***

***safer and fit for purpose.***

**REPLY:**

The replacement of existing green margins with a surface capable of facilitating

pedestrians, cyclists and road vehicles is a major undertaking. The extended

verges would need to be constructed to national roads standards and would

require additional sub-base and bituminous surfacing, drainage measures and

white lining. The cost per linear metre of verge improvement would be high in

comparison to full width road reconstruction.

NOTICES OF MOTION

7.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell

***I will move at the next Meeting that any new developments or impending road works,***

***particularly on main strategic routes, should include necessary ducting for CCTV.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Mitchell and seconded by Councillor

Donegan.

**REPLY:**

We have already included in our planning guidelines the need to provide

dedicated communications ducting for any development, road works, footpath

rehabilitation works, city and town renewal programmes, etc. We will also

include this requirement in the City and County Council Development Plan.

Ducting will be beneficial for CCTV and also for broadband and co-location and

co-development of other communications infrastructure.

8.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Donegan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council coordinate an agreed***

***traffic management plan and social area for Deebert Close Estate, Kilmallock.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Donegan and seconded by Councillor

O’Donnell.

**REPLY:**

The Estate Management Unit of the Council has been engaged with the

residents of Deebert Close and Deebert Park over the past two years with a

view to effecting improvements within the area to improve the quality of life

of everybody living there, with a particular emphasis on safety issues. As a

result, some minor improvement works were undertaken, such as fencing,

installation of speed ramps, etc. Further safety measures in the form of signage

will be installed in the very near future.

The biggest issue identified by residents is the car park opposite, and adjacent

to, their houses, as the traffic generated by mourners visiting nearby funeral

home, and callers to Health Centre at top of the estate. Various suggestions

have been put forward by them as to what measures should be taken in

respect of same but it has not been possible to achieve consensus on a

preferred option. As a result, following recent consultation with relevant staff

in the Kilmallock Office, it has been decided that the Council will work on

possible concepts/designs that could then be presented to residents.

Other Matters Raised:

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the

following items were raised:



Provision of Social Housing in the Municipal District

The Elected Members referred to the number of applications on the Housing Waiting List in the

District and while they welcomed the proposed construction of houses at Glenview Drive, Hospital,

they expressed their disappointment at the lack of provision of new social housing elsewhere in the

Municipal District.

The Elected Members agreed that it was important that balanced housing development took place in

both City and County areas of Limerick and the importance of retaining young people and families in

rural areas of the County. Following a general discussion on the issues involved, the Elected Members

agreed to submit the following Notice of Motion to the next full Council meeting:
---
5

**“We will move at the next meeting that due to the lack of construction of local authority**

**housing in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District Area, we the Elected Members**

**request that Limerick City & County Council should review all of its land banks in the**

**Municipal District with a view to providing the resources to construct local authority**

**housing on this land.”**

Proposed by Cllr Noel Gleeson and seconded by Cllr Bridget Teefy and also agreed by Cllrs

Donegan, Mitchell, O’Donnell & Sheehy.



Appointment of Superintendent

Superintendent in Henry Street, Limerick in relation to the appointment of a Superintendent

for the Bruff District. On the proposal of Cllr Teefy, seconded by Cllr O’Donnell, it was agreed

that a further letter be sent to the Chief Superintendent in Henry Street, Limerick outlining

the Elected Members concerns at the delay with this appointment.



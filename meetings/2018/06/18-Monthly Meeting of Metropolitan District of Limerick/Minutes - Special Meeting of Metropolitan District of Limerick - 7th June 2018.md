The Mayor thanked Members for attending the Special Meeting stating that it was

being held to pass a Vote of Sympathy for former Councillor, Seamus Houlihan, who

had passed away suddenly and tragically. Deep sympathy was expressed to his sons,

Kieran and James, who was also a Member of Limerick City Council from 2004 to

2009, his grandchildren, extended family, friends, neighbours and community, for

their great loss.

The Mayor recalled the late Seamus Houlihan was co-opted onto the then Limerick

City Council following the death of Jim Kemmy which demonstrated the esteem he

was held in. He was a well-known champion of rights for the elderly and was very

much respected in the community of Southill. He would be sadly missed by

everyone who knew him but especially his family and his friends and neighbours in

the local community he was living in. He was a good neighbour and friend and was

always available to help and assist everyone.

Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. They recalled Seamus

as being a true and caring gentleman who worked tirelessly for his local community.

Even though his time on the Council was short, he was an excellent public

representative who represented his own community very well and was a passionate

campaigner for senior citizen’s rights. Members specifically remembered his love for

his family, the community and the trade union movement. His involvement in the

Senior Citizens Parliament was also remembered.

The Director, Physical Development paid tribute to Seamus, on his own behalf and

on behalf of the staff, and extended sincere sympathy to his sons James and Kieran,

his extended family, community and friends. He remembered his warm nature and

his dedication to the people he represented.

The Mayor stated that the Funeral Mass for the late Seamus Houlihan would be held

at 1pm in the Dominican Church with burial afterwards in Mount St. Lawrence

Cemetery.

A minute’s silence and reflection was observed as a mark of respect.

This concluded the Meeting.

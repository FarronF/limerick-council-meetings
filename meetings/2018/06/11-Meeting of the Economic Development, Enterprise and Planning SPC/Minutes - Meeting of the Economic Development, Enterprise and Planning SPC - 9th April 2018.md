**Briefing of the National Planning Framework Implications for Limerick**

A presentation on the NPF issues was given to the meeting. The topics covered

included:

 National Planning Framework Proposal - national view

 Location of Ireland’s future homes

 Phased Population Growth

 Limerick City Population Growth (47,000 - 56,000 increase by 2040) and

implications

 Metropolitan Area Strategic Plan (incl Shannon)

 Growth outside the cities

 Residential development in rural areas

 National Regeneration and Development Agency

 Rural and Urban Regeneration Development Fund (€3b competitive fund)

 Next Steps (RSES to be finalised by Q1 2019 & LCCC Development Plan to

commence 2019)

Committee members highlighted the lack of growth in rural areas and the need for

schools and more housing in rural areas. It was stated that future development---
should address this in order to grow rural areas in a way that encourages people to

live there, as young people are currently forced to leave rural towns and go to cities.

Members highlighted that we need to keep people employed locally in Limerick

rather them moving to cities. It was highlighted that land is zoned but there is a lack

of utilities is an issue with people having to leave local areas due to the lack of

availability of services sites. The role of Irish Water in this aspect will be critical. The

need for an alliance on the Western seafront with Cork, Limerick, Clare and Galway

to counterbalance the East Coast was discussed. Now is an important time for

Limerick strategically, and it was stated that Limerick needs to have a transport

strategy ready. The Council needs to be ready with projects for the competitive bid

process for the €3b available under the Rural & Urban Regeneration Development

Fund. A debate took place as to whether the NPF limits Limerick’s population growth

or is a realistic target. It was stated that the NPF is not as ambitious as the Limerick

2030 Plan or the Limerick Docklands Plan. The Council need to encourage more

residential development in the City centre. Members emphasised that resolving the

housing issues needs to be part of the Limerick 2030 Plan including creative ideas to

address the Georgian area of Limerick. Members agreed that the SME sectors also

needs to be a focus, rather than just FDI.

Members stressed the importance of the structure and balance of next LCCC

Development Plan.

**Item 3**

**Update on LIHAF - Mungret:**

The meeting was updated on the current position regarding the LIAF funding for the

residential scheme in Raheen / Mungret. A shortfall in the construction costs of the

distributor road will arise. It is proposed that the shortfall would be met by the

introduction of a Supplementary Development Contribution Scheme for the lands

that will be serviced by the road.

In addition, the line of the proposed road has been altered which will require an

amendment to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan.

Work on the amendment of the LAP and the Supplementary Contribution Scheme is

currently underway and should be completed by mid-June 2018.

Members were advised that Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC has been asked by the

Council to draft a masterplan for the entire site.

Members asked that there be early engagement with the landowners affected by the

road so as to ensure that progress on the scheme is not hindered. The members

acknowledged schools, public amenities, smarter travel routes were being put in

place before residential development of scale begins. Members were also supportive

of a mix of private, social and affordable housing on the lands. Member requested

that they be kept up to date on this issue.

It was agreed to suspend Standing Orders to allow the meeting to continue for

another 45 minutes.

**Item 4**

**Presentation from Innovate Limerick**

Key issues covered in the presentation included:

 Innovate Limerick Team

 On-going Initiatives

 Strategic Partners---
 Rathkeale Enterprise Centre

 Kantoher and Bruree Enterprise Centre

 Troy Studios

 ENGINE

 Plans for 2018

 Action Plan for Jobs

The Members congratulated Mike Cantwell and his team for the achievements of

Innovate Limerick in such a short space of time. In particular, the importance of county-

wide initiatives was highlighted. Members emphasised the importance of the high level

IT sub-committee which has been established to develop an IT Strategy for Limerick.

It was agreed that Innovate Limerick is not just focused on FDI but also on indigenous

business and scaling companies for example Design Pro which has created 70 jobs

to date and announced another 50 jobs. Limerick City and County Council is one of

the first local authorities to have developed a food strategy. The Council and Innovate

were congratulated for their initiative in the establishment of Troy Studios and for their

ongoing support for the project. Members expressed concern regarding slow pace in

resolving the Shareholder issue within the company.

This concluded the business of the meeting

**Policing Issues**

At the outset the Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Eamon O’Neill to the Meeting

and Members agreed Meetings of the JPC be convened on a quarterly basis going forward.

Members raised the following points in relation to crime prevention and detection in the

District:-

 The rampant use of illegal drugs in public houses without the publicans knowledge.

 Unemployed individuals driving expensive cars.

 The number of thefts among travelling gangs in the area.

 The disappointment that the Garda Station in Askeaton is not operation 24 hours

per day and the importance of an increased Garda presence thought the District.

 The increasing number of exaggerated insurance claims.

 The extent of crime that goes unreported by the public specifically in the rural

areas of the District due to fear of recrimination from the individuals involved.

The Superintendent acknowledged the issues raised by Members and responded to each

of their concerns.

 Drug use is on the increase due to more disposable income being available. The

Gardaí have a limited capacity to investigate in Newcastle West District, however,

they continue to monitor and target suspects.

 There is a qualified CAB profiler in the District who is investigating organised

criminality.

 The Superintendet informed Members they have an ongoing operation targeting

travelling gangs and have had a huge success specifically with the theft of

numerous quads in the District over the Christmas period. They also have good

cooperation from scrap yard businesses, however, the Superintendent stressed

that people also need to be more vigilant and take responsibility to ensure their

property is protected and money is not left on the premises.

 The Small Areas Policing (SAP) programme is currently being rolled out and each

sub-district will receive a Community Guard. There are also five new Guards being

appointed to the Newcastle West District with two committed officers dealing with

drug crime.

 Exaggerated claims very hard to investigate and the Gardaí can only deal with the

facts they receive.

 People should feel free to contact the Gardaí in confidence, the Community Guard

will be available to visit the public if needed.

**CCTV Cameras in Askeaton and Rathkeale**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mihai Bilauca, Head of Digital Strategy to the Meeting.

Councillor Sheahan informed Mr. Bilauca that Askeaton Community Council had

requested to attend the July Monthly Meeting as a deputation to discuss the CCTV

installation in Askeaton. Deputation agreed for July Monthly Meeting. Mr. Bilauca agreed

to attend to discuss same with delegation.

Members raised the following queries in relation to the new CCTV cameras:-

 Can the Gardaí track the cameras on their devices, access the CCTV cameras and

use the footage.

 How long is the data retained for.

 What is the extent of the powers in GDPR.

 Phase 1 is now completed, when will phase 2 begin.

 Do cameras have night vision.

The Head of Digital Strategy answered each of the Members queries:-

 It is not legally possible for the Gardai to track the cameras. They can access the

footage to use as evidence for criminal investigations.

 Data is retained for 30 days, if an investigation is pending the data can then be

downloaded by the Gardai.
---
 The CCTV is commissioned under the Garda Siochana Act. The Head of Digital

Strategy informed Members they are currently waiting on legal advise as regards

GDPR privacy laws from their solicitor at present. However, they are ensuring the

monitoring will not effect privacy. Signage to be provided under all cameras.

 Wave 2 completion included the installation of 44 cameras. To commence Wave

2 funding is currently be sought from the Department of Justice.

 The CCTV cameras will work in low light areas and have infra-red installed.

Limerick City and County Council are also currently looking into upgrading existing

public lighting with a view to improving footage quality.

Members thanked the Superintendent and Head of Digital Strategy for their attendance

and contribution to the Meeting.

of Ballyhahill and requested this item go on the Agenda for the next scheduled

workshop of Members with Irish Water to take place in County Hall, Dooradoyle on the

28th May, 2018.

Road Design Office and Mr. Aly Gleeson, PMCE Consultants to the meeting.

The Senior Executive Engineer gave a presentation to Members on the proposed road

improvement works at Court Cross on the N69 near Kildimo.

Following a discussion Members expressed their disappointment that the junction at the

Bog Road Cross, also on the N69, was not included in the proposed road improvement

works. The Senior Executive Engineer informed Members funding is directed by the TII

who are only addressing Court Cross on this occassion as their statistics identify the

number of collisions at this location to be double the national average. Members

expressed concerns that the statistics should not have to go above the national average

before improvement work at any location is considered. The Senior Executive Engineer

advised Members he would convey their concerns back to the TII.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Ger Carey, Senior Executive Engineer, Mid West Road

Members were informed that following discussions with TII regarding the Adare Overlay

it is now envisaged that work on the tenuation tanks and car park will commence in July

with the overlay to follow when the Foynes Limerick road is completed. The

construction of a sewer to service this land will be carried out by the Housing

Department as part of the public land activation plan for Adare and will open up this

land for housing construction. Councillor Keary welcomed this development saying a

common sense approach was being taken in this project and would save the tax payer a

considerable amount of money. All Members were happy at the progress on this

matter.

Senior Executive Engineer, Mid West Road Design Office also informed Members that he

was hopeful funding would be made available by TII in the meantime to address the

poor condition of parts of the N21 between Murphys Cross and Adare Village.

**Social Development Directorate**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Seamus Hanrahan, A/Director of Services, & Ms. Sarah

Newell, Executive Planner, Social Development Directorate to the meeting.

The A/Director of Services proceeded with a presentation on the Directorates current

work including Housing Delivery Programme followed by the Public Land Activation Plan

for Adare. The A/Director of Services also informed Members the current numbers on

the Housing waiting list stands at 3119 which represents a reduction of 39% on the

September 2015 to March 2018 figures and went on to say as at 26th April 2018 242

social housing units have been completed to date by Limerick City and County Council

and it is envisaged 312 units in total will be delivered by 31st December 2018.

Following this discussion, Councillor Sheahan questioned how many apprentices are

currently employed by Limerick City and County Council and proposed a policy be

introduced by Central Government to make it attractive to developers to recruit

apprentices on exit from education. This was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue.

The Executive Planner gave a presentation on the Adare Public Land Activation

Programme. Members expressed concerns at the slow progress of the project to date

and were of the belief that a far more significant number of serviced sites had been

mentioned at the initial presentation on the project to the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal

District in September 2017.

Councillor Sheahan was concerned that a condition to the development of this land at

Adare for housing provision would allow for some serviced sites to be provided to local

people who can’t afford the high cost of buidling sites in the area.

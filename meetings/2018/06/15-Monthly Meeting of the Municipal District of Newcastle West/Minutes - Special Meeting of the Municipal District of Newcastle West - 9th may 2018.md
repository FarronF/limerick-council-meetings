on the plan and also noted the availability of staff to discuss the proposed plan during the

Part VIII process.

Overall, the Members supported the plan and also referred to the community involvement

and feedback given during the public display period. It was noted that the plan will address

ongoing traffic issues within the town and its adoption was a historic day for Abbeyfeale.

It was agreed that the following amendments be included in the plan, which were proposed

by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Collins.

**(a)**

That a detailed working model of the proposed traffic lights be presented to the

Councillors prior to the installation of any traffic lights.

causing traffic problems once installed, that the lights will be removed and parking

spaces put back in their place.

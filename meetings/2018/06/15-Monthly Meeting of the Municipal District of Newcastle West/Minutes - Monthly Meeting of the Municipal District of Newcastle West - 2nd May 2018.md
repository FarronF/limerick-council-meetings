QUESTIONS

7.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting what capacity, if any, is remaining at the Tournafulla***

***sewerage plant.***
---
4

REPLY:

There is no remaining capacity at the waste water treatment plant. Irish Water

has provided an update as outlined below in relation to the plant upgrade:

Tournafulla is included as a candidate on a National Programme to address

smaller WWTPs with a capacity of less than 500 population equivalent.

However, the funding available is not sufficient to address the upgrade all sites

with poor infrastructure. To ensure critical national needs are addressed, a set

of investment priorities will be applied; priority will be given to discharges with

the greatest potential environmental impact. Tournafulla will be considered

for upgrade as part of this Project. Further assessment will be undertaken in

2018 to complete this prioritisation.

Councillor Galvin’s question has been referred to Irish Water on

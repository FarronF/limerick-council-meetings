The Council are awaiting approval of the CFRAM schemes from the Office of

the CFRAM need the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the OPW await approval from

the Minister.

150m embankment on the east bank upstream of the bridge and

approximately 150m wall on the west bank downstream of the bridge. The

estimated costs of the Athea Flood Relief Scheme are €381,747 which falls

within the threshold for Minor Works. It is likely that the Council may be

However, the Council cannot proceed with advancing any of the CFRAM

schemes until approval is received from the Office of Public Works.

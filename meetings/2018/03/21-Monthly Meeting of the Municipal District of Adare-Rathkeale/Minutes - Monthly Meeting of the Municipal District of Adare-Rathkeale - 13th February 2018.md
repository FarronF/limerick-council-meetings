**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary**

**I will move at the February Meeting of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal Area that the**

**Local Authority of Limerick City and County immediately commence the harmonisation**

**of housing rent payable by tenants between City and County.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor S. Keary and seconded by Councillor K. Sheahan.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Keary outlined the large discrepancy between rent

charged in the City compared to in the County and called for the matter to be

addressed. The Director, Regional Services informed members that this would be

addressed when the Minister rolls out a scheme nationally.

**REPLY:**

The rent of Local Authority tenants in Ireland is calculated in accordance

with the provisions of what’s known as a Differential Rents Scheme. Each

Local Authority adopts, by executive order, its own such Scheme, but they

all share similar characteristics. The rent is calculated as a proportion of

the assessable income of the principal earner, together with a

contribution from any subsidiary earners in the household. The significant

advantage that this confers on Local Authority tenants over their

counterparts in the private sector is that the rent is based solely on the

income of the household and is not linked to prevailing market forces.

The amount payable will vary up or down in line with income changes of

the occupants. At the moment, the average rent payable by tenants

across the entire administrative area of Limerick City and County Council is

just over €50 per week.

While all Differential Rent Schemes are broadly similar in terms of the

general principles outlined above, each Local Authority would have

customised its scheme to best suit its circumstances and needs. When the

new Local Authority was created for Limerick in June 2014, the Schemes

for both Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council were carried

forward and continued to apply. It would clearly have been desirable to

design and adopt one uniform Scheme for the entire administrative area.

However, it was decided not proceed with this on the basis that the

Department was clearly indicating that the Minister intended to roll out a

Scheme which would apply nationally and would replace any existing local

schemes. Despite such indications continuing, there are still no concrete

proposals emerging for such a step. Having regard to this, and the need to

remove any anomalies in the existing Scheme in this Authority, it is

proposed to consider looking at the possibility of designing the uniform

Scheme referred to above in the current year. Members will, of course,

be consulted in relation to same.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E.** **O’Brien**

**I will move at the February Meeting of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal Area that the**

**Adare-Rathkeale area repair damage to the structural and/or retaining wall at the**

**Market Lane, Summerville, Pallaskenry recently damaged due to storm damage.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Brien and seconded by Councillor

O’Donoghue.

A/Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division informed Members that

he inspected the wall, there is no structural damage on the wall by the road and that it is

a build up of water behind the wall that is coming from the land which is causing the

damage. Therefore, as this is a private matter for the landowner Limerick City and

County Council would not be carrying out repairs works. Members expressed their

disappointment that this is the landowners responsibility and have asked that further

investigation be carried out to resolve this. Also a report from the Manger of Limerick

City and County Council with regard to this is sought for the next meeting.

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey**

**I will move at the next meeting for a programme to open water tables on our rural**

This Motion was moved to the next meeting.

**20.**

**roads to a roadworthy standard.**

This Motion was proposed by Councillor K. Sheahan and seconded by Councillor S.

Keary.

Members are calling on the Minister to respond promptly to this Motion. Members also

noted that the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) need to recognise the serious

situation of the condition of our roads and need to provide funding for same. It was also

discussed that the Limerick Leader reported that Councillor Sheahan suggested using a

the recent theft members are calling on the Garda Station to be open 24 hours. On the

proposal of Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Keary a special meeting is

requested with regard to the location and quantity of CCTV cameras in Rathkeale and

Askeaton. Members request the presence of Askeaton Community Council, the Chief

Superintendent, the Superintendent Newcastle West and Head of Digital Strategy,

Municipal Allocation (GMA) meeting. Director, Regional Services advised Members this

is not possible and a separate workshop to discuss General Municipal Allocation (GMA)

would have to agreed.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue

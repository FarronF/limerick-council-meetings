**QUESTIONS**

**6.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what the value of the Mayoral Chain which was allegedly***

***stolen is, and for an explanation as to why two very different values were printed in various***

***media.***

**REPLY:**

The Mayoral Chain was valued at €6,000. This figure was given to the press in

a reply to a media query. I am not aware of a different value for the chain being

given to any media outlet.

Concerns were expressed at the use of the word allegedly in the question and following

discussion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh agreed that the question would be amended by the removal

of same.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a binding commitment from Limerick City and County***

***Council as to when works will begin and be completed on the Ferrybridge in Castleconnell,***

***due to the numerous false promises made to local representatives and the people of***

***Castleconnell for over a year.***

**REPLY:**

This wall at Ferrybridge, Castleconnell was originally weakened due to traffic

travelling along the footpath close to the wall to avoid floodwaters on the road

during the Shannon flooding event of 2015/2016. The wall subsequently

collapsed into the woodland behind it during a subsequent weather event in

February 2017. Limerick City and County Council placed fill material at the rear

of the wall to support the footpath and erected hessian fencing to protect the

public. The wall is located in an SAC and consequently permission is required

from the National Parks & Wildlife Service before commencing any remedial

works. The site is described as an Alder Carr Wetland. Currently an Appropriate

Assessment is being prepared for the site. The design of the repair has been

completed and the tender process will commence in March 2018. This site is

subject to flooding throughout the year but the window in which remedial

works could be carried out is May, June and July. It is during these months that

Limerick City and County Council propose to commence works. Partial funding

has been provided by the Physical Directorate and additional funding will be

sought from the GMA.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District:***

***1) how much the consultant engineers Mott McDonald were paid in 2016 to advance the***

***road improvement scheme on the R445 from the Kilmurray Roundabout eastwards and to***

***progress proposals to improve access and traffic safety in the area adjacent to the Gaelscoil.***

***2) why the Council failed to present Members with that draft scheme for discussion***

***purposes early in 2017 and why no formal Part 8 planning submission was lodged in May***

***2017 as planned.***

**REPLY:**

1) The consultants were paid €26,866 plus VAT in 2016 to advance the scheme

development including a preliminary design, consultation with relevant

stakeholders, screening reports, etc.

2) The scheme has been advanced to the point where a Part 8 could be

submitted at relatively short notice. The Council did present the preliminary

design to the Members at an early stage. The draft scheme includes a number

of stakeholders and landowners and the Council obtained the consent of a

number of these to submit the planning proposal but it did not obtain the

consent of all landowners. However, these engagements are continuing and the

Council is committed to progressing a scheme to improve road safety and

connectivity on this section of the R445.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask the Council at the next Meeting how many fines have been issued in relation to***

***dog fouling in 2017 and how many have been paid.***

**REPLY**:

A total of five fines were issued for dog fouling offences in 2017. To date, none

of these fines has been paid. However, further enforcement action is being

taken in two cases.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler (to be referred to the Cultural**

**Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I call at the next Meeting on Limerick City and County Council to develop an inventory of all***

***Limerick's historical and artistic assets to ensure their preservation and to exploit their***

***potential as tourist attractions and encourage civic pride.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Cultural Strategic Policy Committee.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting to call for the monthly Local Area Briefings to be held in***

***public and to become statutory meetings.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

Cmhlr. O Ceallaigh outlined the difficulties in having detailed discussions on operational issues

at Metropolitan meetings and compared this with Municipal districts which had fewer elected

members and consequently the opportunity to raise issues of concern and have them

discussed in public. He stated that in the metropolitan district these were discussed at

monthly local area briefings where which were not held in public and were not statutory

meetings. Some members who spoke in favour of the motion agreed with proposal for the

meetings to be held in public with agenda and minutes circulated. Other members stated that

they are happy with the manner issues are dealt with currently and the briefings provided a

forum to raise issues with staff who are directly responsibility for the service delivery. Others

suggested that consideration should be given to formalising the process.

**REPLY**:

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for the establishment of

Metropolitan Districts and Municipal Districts and sets out the procedures in

relation to the holding of meetings.

The Statutory Meetings of the Council which are required under the Act to be

held include :-

(a) Annual;

(b) Budget;

(c) Such other meetings necessary for the transaction of its business (ordinary

meetings).

The Act does not provide for the holding of any Statutory Meetings other than

Full Council / Metropolitan / Municipal / Strategic Policy Committees, etc.

As the Local Electoral Area Briefings are not statutory meetings, in accordance

with the legislation formal agendas / minutes are not maintained in respect of
---

such briefings.

Following further discussion it was agreed that the Council would write to the Minister to

request legislative change in order to place the local area briefings on a statutory footing .

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that a cross party committee be formed to approve the***

***agenda for the monthly Metropolitan District Meetings.***

The Motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Secas. Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh referred to the process in place for considering the Agenda for full Council Meetings.

He outlined in particular issues with items were referred to Strategic Policy Committees (SPC’s)

for discussion which may not have many Metropolitan Members on its membership.

**REPLY**:

The procedures for the preparation of the agenda for Metropolitan Meetings is

set out under Article 33 of Standing Orders which sets out the items to be taken

into account in the preparation of the agenda.

The decision in relation to the placing of motions on the agenda is a matter for

the Mayor who has absolute discretion to refuse to accept any motion which is

not relevant to the business as set out on the agenda.

Any Notice of Motion which is out of order, or contains unbecoming expressions

may be expunged from the Summons by order of the Mayor. In any case in

which the Notice of Motion, is in her/his opinion, irregular or illegal, the

Meetings Administrator to the Metropolitan District shall communicate that

opinion to the Mayor and to the Councillor submitting that Notice.

The appointment of a cross party committee to advise on the agenda is not

provided for in Standing Orders and there is no provision in legislation for this

proposal.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Pond (to be referred to the**

**Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District that as Kilmurray Cemetery is***

***almost full, Limerick City and County Council would immediately begin the process of***

***acquiring a suitable site in the area for a new Burial Ground.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

**14.**

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the consent of the Mayor the following issue was
---

raised:-

St Patricks Day Parade.

Director, Physical Development raised with the Members a request for the use of funding for

the St Patricks Day parade and suggested that a contribution of €30,000 should be allocated

from Division D of the GMA.

Members expressed concern that the proposal was not listed as an agenda item. Members

also queried why this funding request was not received earlier and also if funding was already

allocated under the general arts or festivals budget. Following discussion and on the proposal

of Councillor Hourigan, seconded by Councillor Hurley it was agreed to approve this funding

request but that in future such requests would be listed as an agenda item.

This concluded the Meeting.

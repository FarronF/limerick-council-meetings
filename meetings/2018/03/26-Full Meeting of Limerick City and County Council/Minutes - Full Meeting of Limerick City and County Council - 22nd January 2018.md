expressed their shock and sadness at her sudden and untimely passing and remembered her

as a proud Limerick woman from Ballybricken who had never forgotten her roots when

reaching international fame as lead singer with The Cranberries. Members noted that while

everyone was saddened following Dolores’ sudden death, the outpouring of sympathy and

support for her family since her passing reflected her popularity and her appeal to everyone.

The Members spoke of how her music both inspired a generation who grew up in the 90s

and also continued to be popular in the present day.

Members also paid tribute to a friend and colleague, Michael (Mike) Collopy, RIP.

Recent Adverse Weather

With the permission of the Mayor, Members raised concerns regarding the impact

the recent unprecedented adverse weather was having on the roads network. They

expressed disappointment at the inadequate roads funds allocations for 2018 and expressed

concern at the current condition of many roads throughout the county following recent

adverse weather conditions. In this regard, they highlighted the urgent need for additional

road funding in order to allow the Council carry out necessary essential roads maintenance.

Tribute was paid to the Council staff who were working during the inclement weather to

ensure as many roads as possible were passable and roads were subsequently repaired.

However, Members expressed concern at the damage to motorists’ cars which occurred on

some of these substandard roads.

The Chief Executive noted the Members’ comments and stated that, as well as the

recent adverse weather conditions, a lack of investment over the last ten years, due to cuts

in capital budgets, had contributed to these issues with the road network.

Following further discussion, it was agreed to write to the relevant Minister

requesting that additional funding be provided in 2018 to allow the Council carry out

necessary essential road maintenance.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt

with:

6.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the Council has been monitoring the response for Limerick***

***City and County on www.vacanthomes.ie and what is the level of response to date.***

**REPLY:**

The *www.vacanthomes.ie* website’s administrative team has brought nine

reported vacant homes to the attention of the Urban and Village Renewal

Department for the period Q3-Q4 2017. These properties are now being

monitored by the Vacant Homes Officers in their respective areas.

7.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

***I will ask at the next Meeting if Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae Luimnigh has a plan in***

***place should hotels, currently being highly paid to house Limerick's homeless, decide to***

***evict them.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has made significant progress in addressing

the reliance and use of B&B/hotel accommodation for homeless families and

individuals in 2017. Our records would demonstrate that families are the

primary users of hotel/B&B accommodation in emergency situations. The

Department of Social Protection fund emergency B&B /hotel accommodation

in Limerick via the Homeless Action Team Office of Limerick City and County

Council.

At its peak in 2017, there were in excess of 70 families who were supported

by the Homeless Action Office of Limerick City and County Council in

emergency accommodation. This support was provided via emergency

accommodation, transitional accommodation and B&B/hotel. Limerick City

and County Council initiated a strategy in 2017 in an effort to address this

issue. The Council’s strategy consisted of a multi-faceted approach

incorporating the allocation of Council housing stock, the provision of

supported tenancies, the provision of family hubs by the Council, the

continuing support by the Council of Approved Housing Bodies in leasing and

acquisition of properties, and the further development of the social rental

model. At the end of December 2017, there were 5 families who continued

to require emergency B&B/hotel accommodation. This represents a 93%

reduction in the use of B&B/hotel as emergency accommodation for families

in 2017 from its peak. The Council’s strategy in this regard is ongoing and will

continue throughout 2018.---
12

The Childers Road Family Initiative opened in December, operated on behalf

of Limerick City and County Council by our partners, Focus Ireland. This

initiative can provide accommodation in self-contained units for up to 30

families. A further 4 families can be accommodated in a family hub at

Phoenix Lodge, which was also completed in December 2017. These facilities,

in conjunction with the Twin Oaks Family Hub operated on behalf of Limerick

City and County Council by Mid West Simon and opened in September 2017,

bring the number of transitional family accommodation units available to the

Council to 44 in Limerick. In addition to this, Limerick City and County Council

made a significant number of social housing allocations in 2017 which

enabled families to be removed from homelessness and into long-term,

sustainable social housing tenancies. A number of these tenancies are

supported by our partners, Sophia Housing and the Peter McVerry Trust. This

model enables the Council to continue to provide the necessary ongoing

support to families who may require same. This occurred in addition to

significant work with homeless families and individuals undertaken by a

number of non-governmental organisations, such as Novas, DePaul, Respond,

Associated Charities Trust and Extern, in partnership with the Council.

8.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on proposals to establish a Garda Kiosk in***

***Limerick City Centre.***

**REPLY:**

This matter was considered previously at a Meeting of the Joint Policing

Committee where it was pointed out that there were no proposals for the

provision of a Garda Kiosk in the City Centre. It was pointed out at that

Meeting by the Garda Superintendent that Henry Street Station was adjacent

to the City Centre and that there were Garda patrols around that area on a

daily/nightly basis.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will ask at the next Meeting if a Finance Service Level Agreement has been agreed with***

***the Limerick Public Participation Network and, if not, what are the remaining issues that***

***need to be resolved.***

**REPLY:**

A Finance Service Level Agreement between Limerick City and County Council

and the Limerick Public Participation Network for 2018 has not been agreed

at this time. A number of issues are outstanding which require further

examination prior to finalisation and the matter will be clarified further in the

near future.---
13

10.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on proposals for the Council to bring into***

***public ownership vacant Georgian buildings in the City Centre and redevelop them. There***

***have been proposals at least for one ‘demonstration block,’ is there a timeline for this.***

**REPLY:**

It is the aim of the Urban and Village Renewal Department to assist owners to

bring derelict and vacant properties back into beneficial use. An intensive

Targeted Vacancy Initiative is being carried out in two demonstration blocks

in the Georgian area of the City to facilitate this aim. The Urban and Village

Renewal Department is in regular communication with property owners in

these demonstration blocks to help them activate their respective properties

to reduce vacancy and dereliction.

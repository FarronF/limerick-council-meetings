**REPLY:**

The Council awarded the contract for the footbridge in December 2017 to

Kenny Civil and Plant Hire Limited, Ballinasloe, Co. Galway. A substantial

section of the works will be fabricated off-site. Procurement and fabrication

of the steel sub-structure is ongoing. Site works are expected to start in April

**9.**

**Quest**ion submitted by Councillor W. O’Donnell

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the Council’s plans for its premises at***

***Crawford Street, Bruff.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council owns a building on Crawford Street, Bruff,

which previously served as a small Council depot. The depot was closed in

2005 and, since then, the condition of the building has deteriorated to a

point where complete demolition is required.

Limerick City and County Council has received quotations to demolish the

building. Demolition is expected to proceed in March 2018.

The Crawford Street depot shares a common gable wall with an adjoining

building. The Council is in negotiation with the owner of the adjoining site

with a view to carrying out the demolition of both buildings at the same time.

If no satisfactory agreement is reached, the Council will proceed with the

demolition of the former depot site and provide support and

weatherproofing to the exposed gable wall.

The Library Service will be happy to facilitate this request. In the coming

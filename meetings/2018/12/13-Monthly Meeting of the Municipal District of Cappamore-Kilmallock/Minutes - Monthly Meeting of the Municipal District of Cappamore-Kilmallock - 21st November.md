The Cathaoirleach welcomed a Deputation to the Meeting from Garrienderk Community
Council. The Deputation addressed the Meeting and explained that they had major concerns
with the speed of traffic passing through Garrienderk and were looking for possible assistance
from the Council to fund the provision of a footpath and other improvements, having regard
to the ongoing traffic issues being encountered.

The Members commended the Community Council on their presentation and the work that
they had carried out to date in their community. They also noted the work done by the
Community Council in getting a detailed estimate of the proposed works required.

The Members agreed that increasing traffic levels and the speed of this traffic was an issue
not only for Garrienderk, but also for many towns and villages across the Municipal District
and that funding was required for many projects for traffic calming measures in order to
address this problem. They confirmed that Garrienderk would be included on the list of
projects in the District requiring funding and that the Council would look at all possible
funding channels in an effort to address requests for funding from across the Municipal
District.

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the
following items were raised:

e Notice of Motion-O’Rourke’s Cross

The Members enquired as to why a Notice of Motion relating to O’Rourke’s Cross was not
included on the Agenda for the Meeting. The Meetings Administrator explained that this
Notice of Motion sought to rescind a decision to approve a Part 8 application for O’Rourke’s
Cross which was originally made by the Members at the October 2017 Municipal District
Meeting. He confirmed that legal advice received from the Councils Legal Advisors had
stated as follows:

“The Members do not have the authority in law to re-consider a decision made in 2017 in

compliance with the provisions of the Planning & Development Act 2000 as amended. The
Members at that time would have been entitled to decide by resolution to vary or modify

the proposal. That entitlement has passed.” He also referred to legal advice received from
Senior Counsel on Part 8’s in general, which stated that a Part 8, which has completed the
statutory process, could not be amended.

Having regard to the Standing Orders and the legal advice obtained, the Meetings
Administrator explained that he was therefore not in a position to include the Notice of
Motion on the Agenda for the Municipal District Meeting.

The Members expressed their disappointment at this and the manner in which the original
Part 8 application had been dealt with at the October 2017 Municipal District Meeting.

The Cathaoirleach confirmed that, in accordance with his powers as Cathaoirleach under
Standing Orders, that he was allowing the Emergency Motion. On the proposal of Councillor
Mitchell, seconded by Councillor O’Donnell, the following Motion was unanimously agreed
by the Elected Members:

“That the Members of Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District call on Limerick City and
County Council to rescind the decision made at previous meeting held on October 2017 in
relation to a proposed roundabout at O’Rourke’s Cross, Bruree, County Limerick on the
grounds that at the said meeting of 19th October 2017, the members were given
incomplete, inaccurate and inadequate information e.g., the members were not advised of
the relevant statutory provisions/ guidelines.”

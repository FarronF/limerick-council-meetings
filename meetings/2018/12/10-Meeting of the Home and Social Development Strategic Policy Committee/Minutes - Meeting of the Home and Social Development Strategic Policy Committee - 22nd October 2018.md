**held Monday 9th** **July 2018.**

The Minutes were proposed by Cllr. Leddin and seconded by Cllr. Keary.

**Item 2: Matters arising from the Minutes**

 Cllr. Leddin raised the issue of voids and in particular a desire that Limerick City and County Council

would become void free. A broad ranging discussion followed on the matter. A number of members

expressed concern regarding the amount of time taken to prepare properties for re-letting,

particularly having regard to the ongoing housing shortage. Cllr. Keary expressed disappointment

that elected members were not informed by the executive that funding had been sanctioned, and

that the works had not commenced sooner. The members requested that a detailed inventory of

vacant, void and derelict properties be provided.

 Cllr Keary requested an update on the Council owned lands in Adare. Mr Seamus Hanrahan Senior

Architect stated that contracts have now been issued.

**Item 3:** **Update on the outcome of the Housing Workshop held on the 17th October 2018:**

A report of the discussions and recommendations from the workshop held on the 17th October 2018 was

circulated. Director of Service Aoife Duke also presented a summary of the main issues covered by the

workshop as follows:
---
Planned Maintenance Programme:

It is proposed that Limerick City and County Council will borrow €15 million to carry out a Planned

Maintenance Programme.

**Issue**

**Recommendation:**

Do you agree with the introduction of a planned

maintenance programme to run in parallel with a

response maintenance programme?

This was endorsed by the workshop

Which areas should be prioritised?

Areas in both City and County should be prioritised

based on the works needed, by BER rating and by

occupancy type

What level of works should be undertaken as part

of the programme?

Prioritise works to dwelling by Health and Safety

Requirements

Single Differential Rent Scheme:

**Issue**

**Recommendation:**

Do you agree with the 7 key objectives of the new

scheme?

Those attending agreed with the aims of a

combined rent scheme

Do you have any suggestions on how schemes

should be rebalanced to ensure fairness and protect

the most vulnerable?

Support for balance on harmonisation with weekly

rent based on weekly net income

Do you agree in principle that the new rent scheme

provides a funding scheme for the planned

preventative maintenance programme?

There was general agreement that the new rent

scheme income should be a funding scheme for a

planned preventative maintenance programme.

Choice Based Letting:

**Issue**

**Recommendation:**

What housing types/areas should a choice based

letting pilot apply to?

No clear consensus emerged at the meeting. Other

local authorities will be contacted to obtain

feedback from their experience

How should households bid under CBL?

Consideration should be given to all communication

channels. Possibility of using different terminology

should be considered e.g. expression of interest

Simplifying Areas of Choice:

**Issue**

**Recommendation:**

Currently nineteen areas of choice in the

Metropolitan Area, the aim of the exercise to

simplify the number of areas by expanding the

geographical boundaries.

There was general agreement with this objective
---
A discussion took place as follows:

 Planned Maintenance:

The members of the SPC expressed a general welcome for the proposed planned maintenance programme.

Cllr. Keary questioned if an audit of the housing stock is planned, which will assist in determining how best

to allocate the funding. In reply, Mr. Seamus Hanrahan advised that it was not feasible to audit each house

and it is intended to carry out a sample audit of houses broken up into different bands based on age and

type. A number of members spoke in favour of a Housing Inspector to check compliance by tenants of their

obligations.

Mr. R. Lowth A/Senior Executive Officer stated that while the local authority has powers available, resources

are needed to ensure adequate supports are available. He confirmed that a future workshop would include

the topic of tenant deposits.

 Single Differential Rent Scheme:

A number of the members requested that the single rent scheme should be prioritised for implementation

as a matter of urgency. The view was expressed that the current system of separate legacy rent schemes for

the City and County leads to some people paying significantly more than others with similar incomes. In

reply, the Director of Services advised that significant work is required in order to design, implement and

communicate a new scheme to tenants to ensure balance and fairness. It is anticipated that this work will

be completed during the second half of 2019.

The Director of Service stated that it is intended to have a second workshop for Councillors and Sectoral

Interests during December where the planned maintenance programme and the single differential rent

scheme will form the agenda, and that the members would be fully consulted prior to any decision regarding

the allocation of resources under the planned maintenance programme.

The Chairperson Cllr. O’Donnell asked for the committee to endorse the recommendations of the workshop

and forward them to the full Council.

The members expressed a general welcome for the additional housing these proposed developments will

provide. Cllr Galvin expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed Abbeyfeale development with regard to the

scheme’s density and traffic management issues. Cllr O’Donnell advised that the matter will come before

the Municipal District of Newcastle West and that all members would get a chance to express their views at

that point. A number of members requested for more consultation in preparation of Part VIII applications. A

commitment was given by Aoife Duke, Director of Service that going forward members would be consulted.

**Item 5 Notice of Motion**

 **Notice of Motion submitted by Cllr. M. McCreesh** (referred from the September 2018 meeting of

the Metropolitan District of Limerick):

**I will move at the next meeting that, Limerick City and County Council provide additional maintenance**

**funding to facilitate the immediate response to outstanding requests from tenants of Council owned**

**houses. Repairs considered essential have been left unresolved for a number of years due to lack of**

**funding allocation. This is specifically highlighted in the number of houses awaiting window and door**

**replacement.**

Cllr. McCreesh welcomed the provision of extra resources outlined in the proposed planned maintenance

programme and informed the meeting that it is important that sufficient resources are invested in the

Operations and Maintenance Department as lack of funding prevents necessary works from being carried

out.

Cllr. O’Donnell suggested that the motion had been dealt with as part of the earlier recommendation to

approve the planned maintenance programme. Cllr. McCreesh accepted this proposal.

**Item 6 Any Other Business**

Cllr. Keary enquired as to the progress of the site in Mungret. In reply, Mr. Hanrahan advised that roadworks

have commenced on the site.

Cllr Keller asked for an update on the progress of the Tenants Handbook. In reply Mr. R Lowth advised that

it is currently being proofed and it as anticipated that it will be finalised in the near future.

The meeting concluded.

**Date of next meeting**: Monday 10th December 2018 at 3.00pm, Corporate Building, Dooradoyle

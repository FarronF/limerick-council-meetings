At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Meeting.

The Senior Architect, Social Development, commenced the presentation by giving an

overview of housing developments and social housing availability within the Newcastle

West Municipal District. He noted the overall strategy for housing development along with

the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government targets for delivery. He noted

that the District has 11.6% of the Council housing stock and stated that there are 834

applicants on the housing waiting list for the District. He also noted the activity within the

District for the provision of housing under the headings of build, buy, lease, public land

activation and Approved Housing Bodies activity.

The Members welcomed the presentation and requested a monthly progress report on

housing development to include the number of vacant/void houses within the District, the

number of houses where works are complete along with the number of houses purchased

and leased as well as the number of houses allocated. The holding of workshops at District

level with the Elected Members on housing matters was also proposed.---

The Members also queried the length of time taken to upgrade houses for letting and the

need to place more emphasis on developing smaller estates of 5 – 10 houses within town

and villages outside of the main urban centres of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.

Discussion also took place on casual vacancies, which require minor upgrades and are not

part of the void scheme. The use of local builders and trades people along with the tender

process for minor works was also raised.

The Members referred to the Department response for a proposed development in

Mountcollins and the need to have housing policy re-examined for rural areas as many

housing applicants would prefer to stay within their local communities but are forced to the

larger urban areas due to lack of social housing within small towns and villages. It was also

noted that some housing applicants are refusing offers of Council housing.

The SEAI Deep Retrofit Scheme was noted and it was queried why the Council had not

applied for funding under this initiative. The request to have a dedicated allocations team at

local level and the number of staff working on housing development and maintenance was

raised. Anti-social behaviour within estates and the need for more engagement and support

for communities was also highlighted.

In response, the Senior Architect, stated that the Council are purchasing vacant houses

within smaller towns and villages and refurbishing them in order to make properties

available within these areas. He also noted that the Council has spent €3m on the

retrofitting of older properties.

The Director, Housing Development, noted the €15m loan, which was approved during the

Budget process for planned maintenance works. She also referred to the conditional survey

on Council property, as this would target works under the planned maintenance

programme. Choice based letting was also discussed along with the estate management

team who assist tenants as well as dealing with anti-social behaviour within estates. It was

noted that additional Tenancy Enforcement Officers would be available in 2019.

The Director, Social Development, stated that the Social Directorate was working closely

with the Housing Development Directorate, with regard to Urban and Village renewal. He

also noted that more engagement would take place with Irish Water regarding having

adequate wastewater facilities in place within the smaller towns and villages in order to

allow for housing developments.

This concluded the Meeting.

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next meeting can the process of tracking offset arrangements for development***

***contributions be outlined with regard to ensuring the implementation of agreed offsets.***

**REPLY**:

Offsets refer to works which a developer does over and above what is required by

the term of the planning permission and which benefit the local authority and for

which the developer seeks a reduction on the contributions due to the value of the

works done.

There are a number of aspects of the offset process, which have to be managed to

ensure satisfactory outcome to any offset proposal.

The cost of works which are to be offset against development contributions to be

agreed by parties prior to those works commencing. This offset agreement

between the Council and the developer should be given effect by signing of a legal

agreement between both parties. This agreement to cover cost of works,

arbitration (if needed) and Council access to works during construction.

No new offset proposals have been received since the inception of Planning and

Environmental Services in early 2016 and no offset proposals are currently being

monitored by the department.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan (deferred from the October Meeting**

**of the Metropolitan District of Limerick)**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council appoint a named official to have the “Wild***

***Geese” fountain at City Hall repaired.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor O’Dea.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Gilligan highlighted the importance of restoring this feature

to its original design and the significance of the Wild Geese Associations around the world.

Members supported the motion and emphasised the importance of maintaining our historical

culture in Limerick.

The pumping mechanism of the Wild Geese Fountain at City Hall was out of order

for the past few weeks awaiting a new electrical part. This has now been received

and installed. The fountain is again operational.

The maintenance and repair of the Wild Geese fountain is the responsibility of the

Facilities Section of the Property Services Department. Any queries in this regard

should be addressed to Jayne Leahy, Head of Property Services.

The Head of Property Services stated that, through the Culture and Arts Department, an email

has been issued to the designer William H Turner. Ms Leahy also stated that if Elected Members

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Gilligan**

***I will move at the next meeting that this Council clean what remains of the historic Walls of***

***Limerick of all vegetation and repair same to recognised standards.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Hogan.

The Acting Senior Executive Officer, Capital Investments stated that funding would need to be

sourced and applied for to carry out this work as full stabilisation works are expensive. The Acting

Senior Executive Officer stated that a programme of works of vegetation removal is being co-

ordinated by the Executive Archaeologist that will assist in maintaining these structures and a

Steering Group has been formed within the Council representing Archaeology, Roads, Architects

and Parks. It is the intention in 2019 to focus on the Island Road stretch and to continue with

works at the Linear Park. Ms Donoghue assured the Members that the City Walls are recognised

as an integral and unique part of the City’s heritage and it is the intention of all departments to

maintain and care for them subject to funding.

The Acting Senior Executive Officer agreed with the Members in respect of enhancing and

promoting the medieval heritage and stated that this is an objective in the Draft Tourism Strategy.

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan referred to the importance of maintaining the historic

walls of Limerick and that these walls should be restored to recognised standards. Cllr Gilligan

expressed disappointment with the response and indicated that he will be requesting further

updates on progress.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Loftus**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the Government,***

***to give back control and operation of all water services to City and County Councils throughout***

***the State.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Loftus and seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.

Following discussion by the Members, the Director, Service Operations briefed the Members on

the rationale for the establishment of Irish Water and the emphasis on greater focus and

investment. He also referred to the upgrading of Waste Water Treatment Plants in line with EU

Standards for Discharge. The Director, Service Operations referred to the Workshop held by Irish

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Hurley**

***I will move at the November meeting of the Metropolitan District that this Local Authority***

***participates in the WiFi4Eu Scheme to promote access to wireless connectivity in public places***

***between 2018 and 2020, commencing with this District.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Hurley welcomed the initiative and encouraged Local

Authorities to get on board as the voucher system is operated on a first come, first served basis.

Head of Digital Strategy, Mihai Bilauca, informed the Members that the WiFi4EU initiative

promotes free access to Wi-Fi connectivity for citizens in public spaces including parks, squares,

public buildings, libraries, health centres and museums in municipalities throughout Europe.

Mr Bilauca stated that the WiFi4EU initiative provides municipalities with the opportunity to apply

for vouchers to the value EUR 15 000. The vouchers are to be used to install Wi-Fi equipment in

public spaces within the municipality that are not already equipped with a free Wi-Fi hotspot.

The call for applications was launched on November 7th. The Council has applied through our ICT

Department for 4 vouchers under the WiFi4EU scheme, one for each metro/municipal council.

Mr Bilauca suggested that the installation of Public WiFi will be prioritised based on two criteria:

• the town population

• the technical feasibility of the installation. In some locations it could be easier

and faster to access existing communications infrastructure (e.g. the Council

WAN Network or the Smart CCTV infrastructure).

Mr Bilauca assured Members that they will be notified in due course how many vouchers will be

assigned to Limerick City and County Council and will continue to apply in the subsequent calls, if

needed.

Committee.

**17.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted.

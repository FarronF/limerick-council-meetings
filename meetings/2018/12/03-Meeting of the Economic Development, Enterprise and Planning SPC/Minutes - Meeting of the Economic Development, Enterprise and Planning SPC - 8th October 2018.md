**Item 3.**

**Notice of Motion from Cmhlr Ó Ceallaigh referred from the full Council meeting**

**held on 24th** **September 2018.**

*‘I will move at the next meeting that this Council invite the Minister for Tourism and*

*Fáilte Ireland to the Council Chamber in order to give a briefing as to the reasons for*

*the lack of tourism support and inclusion that Limerick has received in recent years.**’*

Concern was expressed that Limerick was not featuring in Failte Irelands brand

products of the Wild Atlantic Way, Irelands Ancient East or Irelands Hidden

Heartlands. Members felt that Limerick was being overlooked when it came to

marketing of tourism projects nationally and internationally and thus losing out on

visitors to the region. Members felt that Limerick City & County Council has invested

heavily in tourism products in recent years and it should be supported by the national

tourism bodies. Tourism products outside the metropolitan area also need to be

high-lighted and promoted. It was stated that Limerick has no high profile state

supported festival in its calendar of events.

Even though visitor numbers were increasing in Limerick but it was felt that with

greater levels of support from Failte Ireland visitor tourist numbers could rise

dramatically.

The Council was commended in its work on the Tourism Strategy and in the

investment in various projects such as the Great Southern Greenway, Lough Gur,

various festivals and events, etc.

Details of FI’s Festival Innovation Programme were outlined to the meeting.

It was agreed that Failte Ireland would be invited to the next SPC Meeting to brief the

members on their plans for the promotion and investment in Limerick.

**Item 4.**

**Update on the Urban and Rural Regeneration and Development Fund**

**Applications**.

Members received presentation on the projects submitted under both funding calls.

The submissions were made on 27th /28th September 2018 respectfully.

Twelve applications were submitted under the URDF to the value of €20.5m. Ten of

the projects are being led by the Council while the remaining two focussed on the

Limerick Docklands and the International Rugby Museum. Council projects included;

the Opera Project, O’Connell Street Revitalisation, Great Streets, Living Georgian

City, World Class Waterfront, Mungret Residential Initiative, Digital Collaboration and

VR Centre, etc.

Seven projects were submitted for funding under the RRDF. Five are Council led

(Regional Athletics Hub, Great Southern Greenway, Croom Distributor Road, West

Limerick Tourism Gateway, and Glin Public Realm Project). The value of the Council

led projects is €9.3m

Members were also briefed on other projects submitted by other state agencies and

community led Organisations. Decisions on the applications are expected in

November 2018.

Members expressed a huge gratitude to all associated with the preparation and

submission of the applications. The applications showed that the Council and other
---
agencies are hugely ambitious for the Limerick. The City region requires investment

on this scale if it is to act as a counterbalance to the east coast. Members supported

all applications but were conscious of the absence of the Patrickswell and Kildimo

initiatives. Officials address the issues surrounding both initiatives

Members will be kept updated on the applications as they progress through the

selection process.

**Item 5.**

**Update on EU Projects and Initiatives**

It was agreed to defer this item to a future meeting.

This concluded the business of the meeting

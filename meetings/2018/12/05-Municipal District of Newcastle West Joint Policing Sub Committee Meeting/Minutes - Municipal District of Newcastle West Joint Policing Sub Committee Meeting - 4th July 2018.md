lifting particularly high end goods from pharmacies in particular and criminal damage. He

ceased. He also referred to rural burglaries but these have also decreased due to arrests

being made.---

Inspector Cullen stated that incidents of criminal damage is on the increase with incidents

taking place at night and tying in with antisocial behaviour and public order offences. He

stated that on the spot fines can be issued for public order offences and this is a proving to

be a deterrent. He also stated that a number of behaviour warnings have been issued to

young people and this has reduced complaints of anti social behaviour. He said that a

Community Guard has been assigned to Abbeyfeale and this is having a positive effect in the

town.

He confirmed that the area of roads policing is taking place in conjunction with the Road

Safety Authority. A number of operations have been carried out on a weekly basis targeting

speeding, use of mobile phones, drink driving and the non-wearing of safety belts. He also

confirmed the number of checkpoints carried out in the district increased by 10% and the

need to have Garda visibility on the ground is of critical importance.

He referred to the new Community Policing Policy Model where by a Guard would be assigned

to each area within the District and stated that the Draft Plan for the District was submitted

to the Chief Superintendent for consideration. It is envisaged that the plan will be presented

to the Council in the coming months.

He referred to a number of multi-agency operations, which took place during the year with

Department of Social Welfare, Road Safety Authority and Customs and Excise. He also stated

that a personnel carrier has been allocated to the district and there is a commitment of having

five extra gardai assigned to the district but this is dependent on new recruits.

The Cathaoirleach and Members complimented the Inspector on the very comprehensive

report of the current situation within the district. The Members referred to a number of other

items including cctv cameras and their monitoring, the availability of drugs within the district,

illegal dumping and the locations of Go Safe Vans. The possible re-use of vacant Garda houses

was also raised but in many cases it is cost prohibitive to upgrade these properties. On a query

from the Members regarding the provision of a new Garda Station for Newcastle West, the

Inspector confirmed that meetings have taken place with the OPW and the Department of

Justice and the matter is ongoing.

This concluded the Meeting.

At the suggestion of the Chair, and with the agreement of the Members, this item was
brought forward on the agenda.

Ms Sadbh Hanley, Smarter Travel Co-ordinator, delivered a presentation to the Members on
Limerick Smarter Travel (LST) Mobility Management Plans. Ms Hanley explained that LST
engages with employees that are seeking to diversify work commuting patterns to identify
actions which could facilitate alternative travel options. LST then supports the employer to
implement the actions by way of a Mobility Management Plan. Plans are reviewed on a
regular basis. There are currently 12 participating in the initiative.

In welcoming the presentation the Members raised a number of issues relating to safe
cycling, quality of footpaths, rural bus services, crossing points and transportation policy. In
response Mr Kennedy advised the Members that the Limerick Transport Strategy, which is
scheduled to commence in October/November 2018, will look at transport issues in the city.
The Strategy will form a major policy document for transportation in Limerick. He agreed
that a presentation on the Strategy would be made at a future Committee meeting.

Item 3: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Galvin (deferred from June 2018
Meeting)

“will move at the next Meeting that the Government review the locations of the 'Go Safe’
vans within Co. Limerick”.

In proposing the Motion, Clir Galvin called for a review of the locations and purpose of the Go
Safe Vans. He argued that the service had become a source of income for the operating
company, and suggested that the local authority, the Garda, the public and Go Safe needed
to re-examine the locations of the vans.

In seconding the Motion, Cmhir 6 Ceallaigh said that the location of the vans was well known
and therefore the service was not meeting its function. He stated that speed limits should be
enforcing by the Garda and not be private companies. Other Members lent their support to
the Motion.

In responding, Mr Murray advised that the Council had ongoing discussions with the Garda
and with Go Safe regarding the locations of the Go Safe Vans. He noted that the locations
were places of work as defined by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.
Therefore, the locations of the vans had to comply with the legislation. He agreed to bring
the Members comments to the next meeting of the Road Safety Committee.

Item 4: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Galvin (deferred from June 2018
Meeting)

“| will move at the next Meeting that a programme be put in place to number all the local
roads within this Municipal District”.

In proposing the Motion, Cllr Galvin said that the proper numbering of all roads was
important for the reporting of littering, crime, or road quality issues. He acknowledged that
regional and some local roads already had road number signs in place, but called for number
signage for all local roads.

In responding, Mr Murray stated that Physical Development Directorate would undertake a
study, to establish the cost and resource requirements of providing number signs on all local
roads not already signed, and will revert to the Strategic Policy Committee with the
outcome of the study.

Cllr Galvin welcomed Mr Murray's response. The Motion was seconded by Cllr Lynch, and
approved by the Members.

Item 5: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (deferred from June

2018 Meeting)

“1 will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council review the current
use of the Rosbrien Road to Edward Street by Bus Eireann in view of the speed and
frequency of buses and the growing danger to both elderly and young children living on
this road.”

In proposing the Motion, Cllr. Leddin raised the issue of Bus Eireann InterCity using the
Rosbrien Road/Lord Edward Street route as a short cut to accessing the Colbert Station
terminus. He noted that there was a three tonne weight restriction on this road.

In response, Mr Murray advised that Physical Development officials had been in contact
with Bus Eireann regarding this matter and that Bus Eireann had given an undertaking to
instruct its drivers not to use this short cut. Mr Murray pointed out that the enforcement of
the weight restriction was a matter for the Garda. He advised that there was provision to
allow for exceptions to the weight restrictions where vehicles required access to a particular
area, for example, trucks delivering home heating oil or emergency service vehicles.

Cllr Leddin thanked the officials for engaging with Bus Eireann to resolve this matter, and
the Motion was approved by the Members.

Item 6: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin

“| will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council prepare a submission
as part of the NDP2040 to upgrade the existing disused rail lines in the city into new cycle
routes under the €2 billion urban regeneration fund.”

In proposing the Motion, Clir. Leddin stated that there are a number of disused railway lines
in the Limerick area, and there is currently funding available for greenway type proposals,
and suggested that the Council should link with Irish Rail to explore the possibilities for
development of the lines.

In seconding the Motion, Clir Lynch suggested that Irish Rail should be invited to make a
presentation on its plans for the rail lines in Limerick to a future SPC meeting.

In responding, Mr Kennedy said that the Council would be very interested in exploring the
possibility of expanding the greenway network in Limerick with Irish Rail, and that it was the
Directorate’s intention to apply for funding for greenways as and when it became available.
He advised that the infrastructure remains in the ownership of Irish Rail and its future plans
for the lines needed to be considered. He advised that possible future greenways would
also be considered as part of the Limerick Transport Strategy.

The Members were supportive of the Motion and called on the Rathkeale to Limerick City
element of the former rail line to be progressed as a greenway route. Members stated that
there were examples of rail lines being used as greenways on a short to medium term basis.

Cllr Leddin thanked the Director of Service for his response and welcomed the commitment
to the development of greenways. The Motion was approved by the Members.

item 7: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin

“twill move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council examine the
feasibility of constructing a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the river Shannon from
O’Callaghan Strand to Bishops Quay using the original funds allocated for a footbridge.”

In proposing the Motion, Cllr. Leddin said that having recently taken up cycling he had
experience of the dangers of cycling on the roadway, and believed that a proposal for a
pedestrian and cycling bridge would engender widespread support. Mr B Leddin
commented that in his opinion the solution for cyclists on the Shannon Bridge was a
dedicated cycle-lane that could be facilitated by removing the existing centre lane.

In responding, Mr Kennedy informed the Members that a proposal for a footbridge across
the river Shannon has been included in a recently submitted application for funding under
the Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF). He advised that pedestrian and cycling
movement and mobility will be examined under the Limerick Transport Strategy. Mr
Murray confirmed that the Strategy will take between 9 to 12 months to complete. He
advised that the DTTAS element of the funding for the previous footbridge proposal is still
available, but that he was not aware of the status of the philanthropic element of the
funding.

Cllr Leddin welcomed the application for URDF funding, and the Members approved the
Motion.

Item 8: Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhir. S. 6 Ceallaigh

“| will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council introduces
designated parking spaces for motorbikes and mopeds in Limerick City centre and that
these will be monitored to view the viability of their expansion at a later time.”

In proposing the Motion, Cmhir O Ceallaigh said that there was a need to trial a number of
secure parking spaces for motorcycles in the City, suggesting that the area around the Milk
Market might be a suitable location. He argued that motorcycles are more fuel-efficient and
were a more environmentally-friendly mode of transport.

The Motion was seconded by Cllr S Browne and approved by the Members.

Item 9: Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhir. S. 6 Ceallaigh

“twill move at the next meeting that efforts be made to include the refurbishment and re-
opening of the Black Bridge in any plans for a Greenway/Cycleway along the river
Shannon.”

In proposing the Motion, Cmhir © Ceallaigh said that the Black Bridge was a well-used
amenity until its closure some years ago. He acknowledged that Councillors had contributed
to the cost of carrying out a study on the Bridge which had identified a cost of
approximately €1 million to re-instate it. He was now seeking national funding to redevelop
the Bridge.

The Motion was seconded by Cllr S Browne. Members pointed out that there was another
bridge with pedestrian and cycling facilities in UL, a short distance from the Black Bridge,
and that €1 million was a lot of money to be spending on a similar facility. Cmhir O Ceallaigh
noted that there would also be a cost in removing the Black Bridge, cited the historical
significance of the Bridge, and stated that he had received numerous requests from
constituents to re-open it.

Mr Murray provided the Members with the background to how the Bridge came to be
closed, and advised that this was as a result of damage to the wooden piles supporting the
Bridge in flooding events. A consultant’s report estimated the cost of repair to be €1M.

In responding, Mr Kennedy advised that there may be an opportunity to seek funding for
the Bridge in greenway or future URDF applications.

The Motion was approved by Members.

Item 10: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

“twill move at the next Meeting that the Council install, without delay, traffic calming
measures in all towns and villages in County Limerick where there is a lack of Garda
presence due to the shortage of Gardai and the closure of local stations. In the interest of
the health and safety of residents — both young and old — speed indicators, ramps and
other traffic calming measures are urgently needed as is clear from the fatalities, near
misses and traffic issues in the towns and villages of County Limerick.”

In proposing the Motion, Cllr O’Donoghue referred to the recent tragic fatality in Ballingarry
and called on traffic calming measures to be installed in all towns and villages in County
Limerick. He stated that speed ramps were the only effective way to reduce speeding.

In seconding the Motion, Clir Lynch referred to the speed limit at Clarina and to three
fatalities in that area. Other Members supported the Motion calling on a number of traffic
calming solutions to be installed at various points throughout the County.

In responding, Mr Murray referred to the Council's Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas.
He advised that the Council would initially have to consult with An Garda Siochana to
identify speeding blackspots. The Council would then carry out speeding surveys, and
where it is established that traffic calming is warranted, the area office would have to seek
grant funding, or provide a budget, for the proposed scheme. As per the approved Traffic
Calming Policy for Urban Areas a prioritisation of schemes will have to be established and
implemented on a phased basis as funding allows.

Mr Murray stated that Physical Development Directorate would work with the area offices
to identify speeding blackspots and request the area offices to proceed with the traffic
calming warrants.

He noted that speed limits were being addressed under the review of the Speed Limits Bye-
Laws, which will be coming before the Districts shortly. He advised that DMURS provisions
had been included in the Council's Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas.

Item 11: Make Way Day

Ms M Browne advised the Meeting that Make Way Day events were held nationwide on
26" September. Events were held in Limerick in association with the Council's Disability
Officer. The Step Forward Group in Hospital undertook walkability surveys in Ballylanders,
Galbally, Bruff, Hospital, Kilmallock and Kilfinane. She raised concerns regarding issues for
people with disabilities and older people with obstructions on footpaths, in particular cars
parking on footpaths. She invited a representative of the Council to attend a Step Forward
Group meeting.

Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the Council has worked with many disability groups and
would continue to do so. He offered to meet with Ms Browne to discuss specific issues and
to link with the Area Engineer regarding same.

The Meeting then concluded.

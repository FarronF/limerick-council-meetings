The Mayor stated that the Budget 2019 process for engagement with Members commenced

on 17th September, 2018, with an initial Corporate Policy Group meeting. On 24th September,

2018, the Council made its decision on the rate of Local Property Tax (LPT). There were two

further Corporate Policy Group meetings held on 15th October and 12th November. Also, the---
2

draft budgetary plan was approved by each of the Municipal Districts and Metropolitan

District during October. During the period 15th October to 19th October, there was a Statutory

Draft Budgetary Plan Meeting in the Metropolitan and Municipal Districts. There were two

further CPG Meetings on 15th October, 2018, and 12th November, 2018. In addition, earlier

that week, there had been a Full Council Workshop on 12th November where the Draft Budget

2019 was presented to the Members, followed by an extensive Question and Answer Session.

Consideration and adoption of the Schedule of Municipal Works by each of the Metropolitan

/ Municipal Districts would be set for early 2019 following the adoption of the Budget.

The Council are required to consider the Chief Executive’s draft Budget for 2019, in

accordance with Section 103 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, along with

determining the Annual Rate on Valuation. Also, the 3-year Capital Programme 2019-2021

would be considered in accordance Section 135(2) of the Local Government Act 2001, as

amended. In relation to the various proposed Schemes, they would be considered

subsequently, as set out on the agenda.

He concluded by stating that the Chief Executive would present an overview of the draft 2019

Budget:

The Chief Executive referred to 2019 the year in which Local Government as we know it will

celebrate 120 years of our existence. As a sector and integral part of government we have

adapted in our attempts to keep pace with the ever changing social economic and cultural

environment and the demands of a multicultural and diverse society. We have seen our

country and the people of the local region we serve suffer the consequences of economic

devastation and which manifested itself in the past years in Limerick’s poor economic

performance, employment black spots, the consequential deprivation and our reputation at

home and abroad.

The Chief Executive recalled June 2014 when Limerick City and County Council came

together as a new authority with a clear sense of purpose, a shared vision for Limerick and

the Midwest, and a determination to address the ills of the past. While embracing the

values of public service and remaining true to the ethos of local democracy this council

made the vital decisions that have restored belief, confidence and pride to the region.

It is important that to remind ourselves of some of the key decisions that enabled progress

to be made.---
3

The Chief Executive outlined the key decisions that had been made such as;

Agreeing an historic single annual rate on valuation for the first time allowing the

stimulation of the local economy underlining our commitment to economic growth in order

to generate employment and create an environment for continued prosperity.

Fully embedding the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) into

the Limerick City Development Plan 2010-2016 (as extended) with €170m committed by

central Government in the national capital plan.

The provision of €10m investment for Limerick to shine as National City of Culture 2014 and

a commitment to maintain an annual Arts and Culture fund thereafter

The raising of a working capital loan of €32m to help kick-start the Limerick 2030 Plan and

drive investment across the city and county by the development of key strategic sites.

The purchase of the former Dell factory in Castletroy to allow Troy Studios develop its

footprint and build a successful international quality film, TV and content industry in the

Limerick region.

Establishment of Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development DAC to prioritise the

redevelopment of 1.4 million sq ft of prime real estate accelerating Limerick’s emergence as

one of Europe’s most attractive investment locations.

The Members’ vision for the Opera Site received the backing and support of the European

Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank with €170 million being

provided for development highlighting the confidence both institutions have in Limerick’s

plans for the city centre.

The provision of an additional 25% (€2.3m) on the allocation of €9.276m Rural Development

Programme to assist in delivering strategic rural projects across County Limerick in

partnership with West Limerick Resources and Ballyhoura Development CLG.

Becoming one of the first local authority in the country to adjust upwards the rate of Local

Property Tax (LPT) above the base line figure allowing greater investment in the delivery of

key local services at a minimal cost to the property owners.

The provision of a Small and Medium Business Support scheme to protect and scale this

sector. Also, the extension of the Business and Retail Incentive scheme to all towns and

villages in Limerick to address property vacancy rates and support the business community.

The establishment of Innovate Limerick, which is driving innovation and acting as a delivery

mechanism for the projects outlined in the Limerick 2030 Plan and the Limerick

Regeneration implementation plans and others.

The Chief Executive stated that the leadership, vision and decision-making shown by the

Members have supported all of these initiatives and this faith in the new Limerick story has---
4

seen Limerick now become the fastest growing economy in Ireland and the Irish urban

success story of the last decade.

The Chief Executive stated that the Draft Budget presented today has been prepared on the

principle of a “balanced budget” based on the overall level of resources available to the

Council and the requirement to meet statutory, contractual, legal and other obligations. It

incorporates the decisions made by the Council in relation to the local property tax and

general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocations. Under the Local Government Act, 2001 as

amended, the Draft Budget is required to set out the expenditure necessary to carry out the

functions of the Council and the income estimated to accrue to the Council.

Budget 2019 marks the end of an historic period for local government not just in Limerick

but in the country as a whole. This budget is the fifth since the amalgamation of Limerick’s

two councils and is the last before we head into the local elections in May 2019.

Limerick’s can-do attitude, which has made it one of the fastest growing regions in Ireland,

has been led by the Council. Since Limerick City and County Council came into existence in

2014, staff have been flexible in adapting to the changing work environments and

structures, while always ensuring the maintenance of quality services with limited

resources. Elected members have supported the changing environment and work practices

and backed the entire progress through strategic decision-making and strengthening the

income base of the Local Authority.

The Chief Executive stated that all of this work has been completed against the backdrop of

an uncertain economic environment and various challenges posed from social, economic

and environmental viewpoints. Despite the uncertainty Limerick City and County Council

continues to grow quality local authority services.

The Chief Executive referred to 2018, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events,

which demonstrated the professionalism, commitment and determination of staff to

manage the impact of these events. These included several severe weather events at the

beginning of the year and the joyous occasion of the homecoming for Limerick’s victorious

All-Ireland senior Hurling Champions in August.

The draft 2019 budget has been prepared with a proposed 1.9% increase in Commercial

Rates ARV (Annual Rate on Valuation), and reflects the decision by elected members to

increase rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) by 7.5% for 2019. These increases will enable the

Council to further improve service delivery.

The Chief Executive stated that Limerick City and County Council will continue to facilitate

economic development by progressing key capital projects across the City and County

including Urban and Village renewal while also marketing Limerick as a great place to visit

and do business.---

The Chief Executive thanked the Mayor and the Council Members for their foresight,

assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy Group in

preparing this budget. He expressed his appreciation to the Management Team and their

own teams for their commitment and hard work in preparing the document. He stated that

the coming year will again be challenging but offers significant opportunities.

It was unanimously agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Budget 2019, as

circulated to Members, be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:

**Introduction**

“The Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December 2019 has been prepared,

circulated to Members and public notice of the Budget Meeting placed in the press, in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014.

The statutory Budget Meeting has been fixed for Thursday, 15th November 2018 at 11am,

Council Chamber, Dooradoyle. Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by

the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides that the Budget must be adopted within a

period of 14 days beginning on the day on which the local authority budget meeting meets.

The Budget therefore must be adopted by 29th November 2018.

Circular Fin 05/2018 also refers to the prescribed period that applies for the holding of the

2019 Budget meeting for Local Authorities as follows; 1st November 2018 to 30th November

2018. It was agreed by the Members at the September Council meeting to hold the Annual

Budget Meeting on Thursday 15th November 2018 at 11am, in Council Chamber, Dooradoyle.---

**Budget Process**

The budget process for the preparation, consideration and adoption of the budget requires

statutory compliance with a number of steps, which can be summarised as follows:

***Step 1 - Decision by the Council on the adjustment factor to the Local Property Tax (LPT)***

***following a public consultation process.*** This decision was made at the Council Meeting on

the 24th September.

At the Statutory Budget Meeting, the Members will be asked to make the following decisions:

 Adopt the Budget with or without amendment.

 Determine the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV).

authority has enabled and accelerated the growth of a renewed, unified Limerick and a

Limerick with a bright future through key budgetary decisions made by Members.

Some key decisions include:

 Agreeing an historic single annual rate on valuation for the first time allowing the

stimulation of the local economy underlining our commitment to economic growth in

order to generate employment and create an environment for continued prosperity.---

The leadership, vision and decision-making shown by the Members have supported all of

these initiatives and this faith in the new Limerick story has seen Limerick now become the

fastest growing economy in Ireland and the Irish urban success story of the last decade.

**National Economic Outlook**

The Irish economy has continued to perform strongly this year despite a softening of the

growth in the Eurozone and the UK. While the global economic outlook remains bright, there

remains a number of dark clouds on the horizon. The UK will be the slowest growing economy

in Europe in 2019. Given Ireland’s reliance on this key export market, the risks posed by a

hard Brexit are evidenced by the drop of 7.2% in exports to the UK already this year. Emerging

market imbalances are also an area of concern. As the economy overall approaches full

employment, wage pressure and labour shortages will become a broader issue and a

constraint on economic growth potential.

**Table 1: Summary of Main Economic and Fiscal Variables (per cent change (unless stated))**

Source: Department of Finance Economic and Fiscal Outlook Budget 2019, p.2

The Local Government Sector is part of General Government (as is the Local Government

Fund). Own-resource Local Authority (LA) expenditure is profiled to stay broadly flat in 2019,

this means that own-resource expenditure must stay in line with last year unless specific

revenue raising measures are identified (i.e. increased rates, LPT, housing rents, parking fees,

planning fees, library and sports facility fees, casual trading fees etc. ). So, expenditure policy

at the sub-General Government level will have serious implications for national fiscal policy -

expenditure increases in the LA & other sectors with own resource income will have to be---
9

met by offsetting expenditure reductions in voted expenditure to ensure compliance with

fiscal rules.

**Local Outlook:**

2018 has seen many significant milestones occur for Limerick City and County as we continue

our ambitious plans to develop Limerick into the future.

It has been an exceptional year on the jobs front with more than 3,000 jobs announced for

Limerick since January 2018 and over €516 million invested. Companies which have made

investment announcements during the year include H&MV, AMCS, Nordic Aviation Capital,

Uber, Edwards Life Sciences and Eir.

This brings a total of 15,712 jobs for Limerick since 2013 with over €2.2 billion of investment

by companies including General Motors, Troy Studios, Regeneron, Fazzi, HCL, WP Engine,

Design Pro and Northern Trust.

We have, with our Limerick 2030 economic and spatial plan, a clearly defined pathway and,

step by step, we are making our way to a place that Limerick has never been before.

A carefully planned, sustainable and socially balanced city at the centre of - and driving - a

wider region that, in turn, is playing a major role in a rebalanced and effective national

economy.

With just two full years of activity behind it, 2019 will be the third and pivotal year for Limerick

Twenty Thirty Strategic Development DAC. 2019 will see very significant progress across the

company’s impressive portfolio, picking up on the momentum gathered in 2018, most notably

and visually around its first major build project, Gardens International, which is now in the

advance stages of completion. This LEED Gold development – one of the highest international

quality accreditations in the construction industry – will be operational in the New Year when

its first tenant, Nordic Aviation Capital, takes up occupancy.

Already completed and operational is Troy Studios, a 350,000 sq. ft. film hub that reflects the

exciting mix in the revitalised Limerick. 2018 saw filming begin at the site, with up to 350

people working on a new production called ‘Nightflyers’, by Universal Cable Productions for

American broadcaster Syfy Netflix channel. Troy Studios’ sound stages are already operational

but an expansion was announced in the autumn to help create year-round film production.

2019 will be a momentous year also for the landmark Opera Site, the 1.62 hectare city centre

project that will be developed at a total cost of circa €180m. Fully funded as of 2018 and with

master-planning significantly advanced, the project will take a critical step shortly when a

planning application will be lodged with An Bord Pleanála for the development. Late 2019 is

also expected to see enabling works at the site, ahead of construction on what is one of the

most important developments ever undertaken in Limerick, one with the capacity to create

3,000 jobs across a 450,000 sq ft campus.---
10

Master-planning will also be advanced in 2019 at another key development, the 10-acre

Cleeves Riverside Campus on the northern bank of the River Shannon, which is suited to a mix

of potential uses, including education, tourism, residential, incubation/innovation space and

commercial office. An inter-disciplinary design team was appointed in 2018 to carry out a

scoping study to explore options going forward for this high-potential site.

Significant steps will also be taken in 2019 with the Mungret Park development, one of the

largest planned residential projects outside the capital. Master-planning was commenced in

2018 on this 60-acre site, which will ultimately be able to deliver an 850-unit development

built over a phased basis. A planning application will be lodged in 2019 for the first phase –

250 units. This is scheduled for completion in 2021.

We are approaching the first anniversary of ENGINE, a dedicated fixed office, co-work and

training facility located in the heart of Limerick's Georgian District. There are currently 90

people working on site with expansion plans for this facility including the creation of a Digital

Collaboration and Virtual Reality Centre in the adjacent building (No. 29 Cecil Street).

Building upgrade works have been completed at Rathkeale Enterprise Centre, with anchor

tenant Design Pro recently announcing further expansion plans. It is envisaged that the

workforce at this former Andersen Ireland Factory will reach 200 in the coming 12 months

with an E-Hub in Abbeyfeale also set for development as a central community space.

As a local authority, we are determined to ensure that the housing challenge continues to be

addressed in a focused and concerted manner under the policy framework of ‘Rebuilding

Ireland- Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness’. To that end, I have established a Housing

Development Directorate whose sole focus is on Housing Delivery to meet housing demand.

In tandem with the delivery of new units, the focus is also maintaining and enhancing our

existing housing stock. During 2019, Housing Development will bring a strategic focus to this.

A planned maintenance programme will see significant, targeted investment in the homes of

our tenants through investment of a €15m loan over a 4-year period. Such a programme

would also bring greater focus on voids, dereliction and vacant houses. The Housing

Maintenance Programme, that we are all familiar with, will continue in response to general

maintenance calls from our tenants.

The introduction of a Single Differential Rent Scheme throughout the City and County is an

important step in achieving fairness and consistency in terms of the calculation of rents. We

are very aware also of the importance of ensuring that the charges levied are based on our

tenants’ ability to pay.

While the standard allocation model will remain in place, it is our intention to pilot a Choice-

Based Letting (CBL) model of allocation during 2019. The management of existing tenancies

is a critical piece of work in which we continue to engage.---
11

Consultation and communication with our Elected Representatives, our tenants and the wider

community is critical. We are committed to working collaboratively to achieve a solution to

the housing challenges we face.

Strong collaboration with Approved Housing Bodies will continue, as a means of enhancing

delivery mechanisms while also providing additional services to our tenants who face

significant challenges in their daily lives. The continued roll-out of a Housing First model will

allow us to work with families and individuals, who have experienced homelessness, by

providing the continuing support they need to build stable, permanent homes for themselves,

their families and their communities.

The Housing Development programme is ambitious, but, by actively and constructively

working together, we will accelerate supply and transform housing in a way that will be to the

benefit of all who live, work and invest in Limerick.

I have restructured the Social Development Directorate to provide a more co-ordinated and

accessible services for all communities in Limerick. The development of enhanced community

supports is critical in the overall development of our City and County having regard to the key

role the community and voluntary sector play. The co-ordination of service delivery and

funding streams will result in increased value for money and achieve better outcomes for

local communities. There will be a significant focus on stimulating and strengthening

Limerick’s City, towns and villages to improve quality of life and investment. This will help

address dereliction, vacancy and underutilisation, providing property development supports

and place-making.

The Council will progress in 2019 key infrastructural projects including the M20 Limerick to

Cork scheme, the Foynes to Limerick City Road scheme, the Mungret (LIHAF) Road scheme

and the Northern Distributor Road. These schemes will facilitate further economic growth

for the City and County.

**Budget Strategy & Objectives**

The Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the

overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory,

contractual, legal and other obligations. It incorporates the decisions made by the Council in

relation to the local property tax and general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocations. Under the

Local Government Act, 2001 as amended, the Draft Budget is required to set out the

expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the Council and the income estimated to

accrue to the Council. The key objectives of the 2019 Budget are set out in the Table below:---

**Outturn 2018**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2019 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council

as at 31 December 2017. The Annual Financial Statement of Limerick City and County Council

for the year 2017 shows the accumulated balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit

position of €812,260.

I have reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to

break-even on the Revenue Account for 2018; however there is pressure on a number of

income heads and ongoing controls on expenditure are in place.

The 2019 draft Budget reflects the need to continue a strong financial management ethos

while making every effort to meet the ever increasing demands on the services of Limerick

City and County Council.

**Analysis of Expenditure Requirements 2019**

The total estimated expenditure included in the Draft Budget for 2019 amounts to €689.585

million, an increase of €128.262 million on the adopted figure for 2018. The growth in the

HAP transactional Shared Service Center accounts for the majority of this increase. As this

expenditure is matched by an increase in corresponding income, it has no net effect on the

Budgetary Provisions. The following ***Table 2*** depicts Revenue expenditure by Division.

Comparative figures for Budgets 2019 and 2018 are shown hereunder.

**Chart 4: Analysis of Income: Draft Budget** **2019 v’s Budget 2018**

**Local Property Tax Allocation 2019**

Local Property Tax (LPT) is now a key funding source for Local Government replacing the

General Purpose Grant funding allocation. The initial allocation under this funding heading

was confirmed as €17,554,464. The basis of this funding is an allocation of 80% of the LPT

collected from property owners in the City and County and retained by the Local Authority

with the remaining 20% being paid into an equalisation fund from which payments are made

to Counties not achieving a level of funding equivalent to the 2013 General Purpose Grant

(GPG) through their own LPT receipts.

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 and associated Regulations permits the Members of

the Council to vary the Rate by a maximum increase or decrease of 15%. The Council decided

to adjust the LPT rate upwards by 7.5% in 2019 equating to an increase of €1,177,602.

**Commercial Rates**

Commercial Rates is a significant contributor to the total budgeted income for the Council

and it is vital to the level of service delivery that income from this source is maximised. In this

respect it is critically important that the Valuation Office reverts promptly with new valuations

during 2019. Limerick City and County Council will continue to ensure that all commercial

properties in the City and County are included on the rates records and are properly rated.

The Council continues to improve its collection percentages across all the major income

headings. In that respect engagement with rate-payers with a view to addressing arrears will

continue to be a priority during 2019. In circumstances where there is no engagement, the

Council will pursue the outstanding arrears via the legal route.

Draft Budget 2019 has been prepared assuming an increase of 1.90% in the general Annual

Rate on Valuation (ARV), with the distribution of the 1.90% noted across the services outlined

below in ***Table 6***:

**Vacant Property Scheme**

Section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for an amendment to rating

law in relation to the refund of rates on vacant properties. This change now gives the power

to the members of local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual

local electoral areas within the overall administrative area of the local authority.

Article 29 of the Local Government (Financial & Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provides

that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be decided at the statutory annual budget

meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area

shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The budget has been

framed on the basis the refund rates on vacant property noted in ***Table 8*** below.---

The following amended vacant property scheme is proposed to continue in 2019:

Up to €2,856 Annual Rate Demand

Over €57,025 Annual Rate Demand

**Table 8: Proposed Vacant Property Scheme 2019**

**Small and Medium Business Support Scheme 2019 (SME Scheme)**

The proposed Small and Medium Business Support scheme will pay a financial support to

occupiers of commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €25,000 but not less than €1 in 2019. The proposed % support for 2019 rates is 9%

subject to a maximum refund of €1,000 which will be subject to a number of terms and

conditions.

**Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2019**

The Proposed Tourism Sector Support Scheme for 2019 will be a financial support/reduction

to occupiers of commercial properties directly linked to the Tourism Sector. In order to

qualify, the total annual Commercial Rates liability must be in excess of €25,000 (Businesses

with a Rate Demand less than €25,000 already qualify for the SME Scheme 2019) and is

subject to a number of terms and conditions. The support grant payment which is aimed

specifically at the Tourism and Hospitality Sector will be set at 4% of the total Rates, including

arrears, for 2019 subject to the Scheme being approved by the Council.

**Business & Retail Incentive Scheme 2019**

The Proposed Business & Retail Incentive Scheme for 2019 will continue to be available for

businesses in all towns and villages across Limerick City and County Council. The scheme is

intended to address property vacancy rates, improve streetscapes and to support the

business community.---
21

**Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Transactional Shared Service Centre**

Limerick City and County Council operate the HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) on behalf of

all 31 local authorities and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE). The HAP project

went fully national on 1st March 2017. HAP is already the largest non-capital support

programme and is projected to deliver 84,000 of the Government’s overall social housing

target of 131,000 social housing units by 2021. Approximately 350 tenancies per week are

currently established by the HAP SSC. By the end of 2018 it is anticipated that the HAP SSC

will be managing over 45,000 HAP tenancies on behalf of the local authority sector.

The HAP SSC has budgeted to process €512m in payments to HAP landlords and expects

collect almost €125m in rent from HAP tenants in 2019. Circa 17,000 new HAP tenancies will

be set up in 2019. There are currently 57 people employed in the HAP SSC, which is located

in the Granary on Michael Street in Limerick City. The numbers employed in the centre are

expected to increase further in the coming years.

**General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation 2019**

Circular Fin 08/2015 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)

(Amendment) Regulations (S.I.363 of 2015), which amends the Local Government (Financial

and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 by providing that the meeting at which Municipal/

Metropolitan members consider the draft budgetary plan must conclude no later than 10

days prior to the local authority budget meeting.

Following the adoption of the budget a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and

repairs to be carried out during 2019 in each Municipal/ Metropolitan District will be prepared

for consideration and adoption by the Municipal/ Metropolitan District Members.

The draft budget has included a general Municipal/ Metropolitan allocation of €1.203m in

total for district members, which will provide a focus and clarity as regards how the elected

members want to account for the expending of monies within their area.

**Workforce**

Recruitment of staff within the Organisation will continue and in particular will focus on the

replacement of staff following retirements, promotions and departures.

As a major employer in the region, it is important that we provide employment opportunities

to the communities we serve. In this regard, an Apprenticeship Programme will be launched

in 2019. The Graph below shows our overall numbers at present and the number of retired

staff, which will rise significantly towards the end of 2019.---
22

**Chart 5: Analysis of staff numbers and number receiving pensions 2010-2019**

**Business Process Improvement**

The Business Improvement Department is a small dynamic team who drive and support the

Business Improvement approach in Limerick City and County Council. There are several

projects ongoing within the organisation at any one time that use our ‘Define, Measure,

Analyse, Improve, Control’ approach.

‘Project 18’ is a key business improvement project due to go-live in November of this year. It

will serve to embed a Project Management Framework into the Council and provide a system

that will monitor all Capital and Revenue projects across the organisation. Time, Scope and

Money will be tracked across all projects ensuring that adequate allocation of resources and

a tracked response to any changes. It will also ensure that all our projects are connected back

to our corporate aims. Upskilling and engagement with staff on Project Management will

continue to take place to ensure the approach gets traction in the organisation.

Engagement with the public is a key part of the delivery of Local Government services. With

this in mind the Business Improvement Department has also provided training to key

members of staff on ‘Service Design’ which examines how we engage with our citizens in the

design and delivery of our services.

As the Business Improvement Department evolves, more emphasis is placed on evidence and

measurement to ensure decisions are well informed. We will also continue to work with

‘Insight Limerick’ to seek key performance indicators to measure the impact improvements

within Limerick City and County Council are having on the public.

Having a dedicated Business Improvement team demonstrates Limerick City and County

Council’s absolute commitment to the provision of responsive, efficient and innovative

services and we will continue to strive to deliver the highest possible quality of service to our

citizens.

**Irish Water**

The Budget includes for the ongoing Service Level Agreement (SLA) arrangements with Irish

Water as Limerick City and County Council provides water services on behalf of the national

water authority. The Budget includes provision for the expenditure associated with the

operation of the SLA and for the recoupment of these costs from Irish Water.

**Capital Budget 2019-2021**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, please find attached a report on the programme of capital

projects proposed by Limerick City and County Council for the 3 years 2019 to 2021.

A key element of the Capital Programme over the coming years is delivering on the Limerick

2030 plan. Council members agreed to the raising of a working capital loan in 2014 of €32m

and in 2017 approved loans of €170m from the European Investment Bank and Council of

Europe Development Bank to help fund this programme. Also, The Rural Regeneration &

Development Fund and the Urban Regeneration & Development Fund will provide funding

opportunities for the Council to develop strategic projects which were submitted by Limerick

City and County Council to the relevant funding Department for consideration in September

2018.

Given the fact that we are proposing allocations over 3 years, it would be unrealistic to

suggest that these allocations are definitive and are subject to funding being available in

future years. Capital projects by their very nature are flexible rolling plans which involve an

annual review and possible adjustment. Below please find a summary of potential spend and

source of funding for the 3 year capital plan 2019 to 2021.

**Conclusion**

Budget 2019 marks the end of an historic period for local government not just in Limerick but

in the country as a whole. This budget is the fifth since the amalgamation of Limerick’s two

councils and is the last before we head into the local elections in May 2019.

Limerick’s can-do attitude, which has made it one of the fastest growing regions in Ireland,

has been led by the Council. Since Limerick City and County Council came into existence in

2014, staff have been flexible in adapting to the changing work environments and structures,

while always ensuring the maintenance of quality services with limited resources. Elected

members have supported the changing environment and work practices and backed the

entire progress through strategic decision-making and strengthening the income base of the

Local Authority.

All of this work has been completed against the backdrop of an uncertain economic

environment and various challenges posed from social, economic and environmental

viewpoints. Despite the uncertainty Limerick City and County Council continues to grow

quality local authority services.

During 2018, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events, which demonstrated the

professionalism, commitment and determination of staff to manage the impact of these

events. These included several severe weather events at the beginning of the year and the

joyous occasion of the homecoming for Limerick’s victorious All-Ireland senior Hurling

Champions in August.

The draft 2019 budget has been prepared with a proposed 1.9% increase in Commercial Rates

ARV (Annual Rate on Valuation), and reflects the decision by elected members to increase

rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) by 7.5% for 2019. These increases will enable the Council to

further improve service delivery.

Limerick City and County Council will continue to facilitate economic development by

progressing key capital projects across the City and County including Urban and Village

renewal while also marketing Limerick as a great place to visit and do business.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and the Council Members for their

foresight, assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy Group in

preparing this budget. I also wish to express my appreciation to the Management Team and

their own teams for their commitment and hard work in preparing this document. The coming

year will again be challenging but offers significant opportunities. I look forward to the full

support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to be held Thursday 15 November

2018.”

The Mayor stated that the Director for Support Services, would provide an overview of the

draft Revenue Account for 2019 and the proposed 3-year Capital programme. Following this,

he would go through each Division in detail with a summary update of the corresponding

Capital programmes.

The Chief Executive outlined that the Members were required by law to consider each division

of the Budget and Members would be afforded the opportunity for questions and answers in

relation to each division.

The following divisions were considered by the Members:

 Division A – Housing and Building

 Division B – Road Transport & Safety

 Division C – Water Services

In relation to Divisions A, B & C the following points were raised by the Members:

 Members requested an update on Limerick 2030

 Members referred to various organisations providing housing and the need to ensure there

were no duplication of services

 Concern was raised by Members regarding the significant amount of expenditure on

insurance claims

 Additional information regarding the breakdown of the Housing Programme for 2019

 Queries regarding the Planning Regulations in relation to the provision of timber frame

housing

 Concerns regarding the older part of the city and the impact of the demolition programme

within the Regeneration Programme

 Later in the meeting Cllr Galvin (L) stated that the provision for a feasibility study for a

public toilet in Abbeyfeale was inadequate and therefore would not be supporting the

budget.---
26

In addition, Members asked questions on several aspects of the Annual Budget Divisions

A, B & C which were responded to by the Chief Executive and relevant Directors of Service.

The Council then noted the provisions made in the Draft Annual Budget for these Divisions.

Following this discussion it was agreed to consider the following Divisions:

 Division D – Development Management

 Division E – Environmental Services

 Division F – Recreation & Amenity

In relation to Divisions D, E & F the following points were raised by the Members:

 Update on the Cleeves site project

 Request for funding of the Munster Vale initiative

 Tourism and revitalisation of the City Centre

In addition, Members asked questions on several aspects of the Annual Budget Divisions D, E

& F which were responded to by the Chief Executive and relevant Directors of Service. The

Council then noted the provisions made in the Draft Annual Budget for these Divisions.

Following this discussion it was agreed to consider Divisions G, H & J:

 Division G – Agriculture, Education, Health & Welfare

 Division H– Miscellaneous Services

 Division J – Central Management Costs

In relation to Divisions G, H & J the following points were raised by the Members:

 Members queried the Equine project and some Members expressed concern regarding the

policy around the control of horses

 Operational costs of the Coroners and the increase for 2019

 Consideration of a local contractor to carry out the removal of horses

 Implementation of horse control in line with Bye Laws

 Members queried the number of dogs in the City that are microchipped

 Some members outlined the requirement for national legislation to be drafted in the area

of Horse Control.

In addition, Members asked questions on several aspects of the Annual Budget Divisions G, H

& J which were responded to by the Chief Executive and relevant Directors of Service. The

Council then noted the provisions made in the Draft Annual Budget for these Divisions.---
27

Following this discussion, it was proposed by Cllr O Hanlon and seconded by Cllr M Collins to

invite the Minister for Environment to a Special Meeting to discuss the issue of horses. The

Members also requested that the Minister for Agriculture be invited to attend also.

The Mayor stated that this concluded the review of all Divisions within the Revenue

Account. He then asked for a Proposer for the draft Budget, as presented.

**Councillor Collins (M)**

Cllr Collins on behalf of the Fianna Fáil group acknowledged the monumental work that

has gone into the preparation of this estimate and particularly thanked Sean Coughlan,

Director of Services and his team for and making himself available along with the Chief

Executive to work with his FF colleagues and himself.

Cllr Collins also thanked the Management and staff members of the Municipal District

offices along with the outdoor staff who do sterling work in all types of weather and

unsociable hours.

Limerick is dealing with a hugely increased budget this year of €689million up from €561m

last year. This is significant and indicates just how well positioned we are in attracting

businesses to look towards Limerick as a serious contender in where to locate and

conduct their business.

Cllr Collins referred to the key objectives of the Local Authority and was pleased to see a

focus on housing maintenance, homelessness and the buy into the Rebuilding Ireland

project. He referred to the need for further investment in rural towns and villages.

Further funding is needed from Central Government to allow the Council to purchase

more properties that are lying idle in our villages in particular which will in turn deal with

dereliction but provide much needed housing for local families crying out for

accommodation.

The equalization of the rents on our local authority tenants is an issue and welcomed this

scheme but was disappointed to hear that it has taken 3 years to resolve this issue by our

Government.

Cllr Collins stated that “Our message is ...we are open for business and highly competitive

to do that”. Cllr Collins and his party strive for enhanced local services with a proactive

approach to maintenance of social housing stock and continued support to our

communities. Fianna Fáil will support the economic development of Limerick through

effective marketing and positioning of Limerick as a great place to visit and to do business.

Cllr Collins welcomed the delivery of a cultural programme to make Limerick a recognised

cultural hub both nationally and internationally and continue to seek efficiencies in

service provision, cost reduction and value for money.

Cllr Collins referred to the delivery of the HAP Programme which is a major and significant

contract for this local authority with responsibility for a revenue of €518m.---
28

Insurance and rising pension costs continues to be a major drain on this local authority’s

resources and these increased costs have to be funded. Rates is one of the main sources

of income of this budget.

Cllr Collins stated that as the Fianna Fáil group are supporting an increase of 1.9% in the

commercial rate which equates to €1m. This is a significant additional spend which will

deliver vital resources in areas such as roads, street cleaning, community, litter

management, library service and Tourism Development & Promotion.

Fianna Fáil favour the protection of the small rate payer and the rate payer who pays on

time by offering an attractive rates rebate scheme. 94% of properties in Limerick will pay

commercial rates of up to and including €25000 in 2018.

Fianna Fáil continue to support small and medium size businesses and have negotiated

and welcomed a 9% rebate subject to a maximum of €1000. It is important to note that

Limerick’s Commercial rates remain one of lowest in the country, with our near

neighbours Kerry and Clare in the Top 5. The message is clear Limerick is cheaper and

more competitive as destination to do business.

Equally Fianna Fáil welcome the continuation of the Tourism Sector support scheme and

continuing the support payment of 4% for the coming year which is welcomed by the

hospitality sector.

Fianna Fáil support the Vacant Property Refund Scheme as presented but state that we

don't condone or will accept properties deliberately left idle City or County wide.

Cllr Collins referred to a number of capital projects for Abbeyfeale and Newcastlewest.

He welcomed funding for the Athletics hub in Newcastlewest and also the provision of a

tourist office for West Limerick.

To conclude Cllr Collins (M) said he would like to formally propose the adoption of the

budget as presented with the proposed increase of 1.9% in Commercial Rates.

Councillor Collins (M) formally proposed the adoption of the Budget as presented and this

was seconded by Cllr Gilligan (J).

**Councillor Sheahan (J)**

Councillor Sheahan (J), on behalf of the Fine Gael Group, reminded Members that this was

the last budget of this Councils term. He stated that over the last 4/5 years that Limerick

City & County Council has come a long journey. Cllr Sheahan recalled the amalgamation of

the City and County Council and referred to the Authority as a progressive Authority seeking

to adopt a revenue budget of approximately €170 million. He referred to other local

authorities around the country today seeking the adoption of a budget of €35/40million

and stated how progressive Limerick had become.---

The inclusion of the HAP Shared Services is a significant addition to our budget. It was with

great pride that I read about our 3 year Capital Programme in the Limerick Leader today

and great to see that we are making the headlines in such a very positive manner. This

shows as a local authority just how far we have come. Cllr Sheahan welcomed the

aspirational Capital Programme and is looking forward to being present at these sod turning

events. He is proud to be part of a Government that is back on its feet and in a position to

spend money.

Cllr Sheahan stated that this is a positive budget and acknowledged the funding received

through the Urban and Village Renewal Scheme and the Community Enhancement

Programme to provide for upgrade in our community’s park and public areas. Cllr Sheahan

acknowledged the funding received from SICAP through the LCDC’s. Cllr Sheahan referred

to the Roads budget which is now back to where it was in 2008 stating that this is a very

positive budget.

Cllr Sheahan referred to the budget presented today seeking a 1.9% increase in commercial

rates which would represent an overall increase of 8.65% increase in rates since 2016 and

was not satisfied with this. Cllr Sheahan stated that this needs to be reviewed and

consequently, the Fine Gael Group were not in a position to support the Budget as

presented. Cllr Sheahan suggested that a vote be taken on the budget as presented and

Fine Gael would reserve their position in relation to the proposed amendments.

**Councillor Leddin**

Councillor Leddin, on behalf of the Labour Group requested that Sinn Féin clarify where

they would fund the contribution of Local Property Tax (LPT) if LPT was abolished.

He also requested that if Fine Gael were not supporting the budget as presented, that they

would put forward an alternative proposal.

**Comhairleoir ÓCeallaigh,** on behalf of the Sinn Féin Group, referred to HAP as the ‘white

elephant’ and how national spending is directed at private landlords rather than local

authorities directly building houses. Cmhlr ÓCeallaigh stated that Sean Coughlan, Director

of Services met with each party in advance of the Budget and confirmed that the authority

operates the HAP Shared Service on behalf of the Government. Cmhlr ÓCeallaigh

expressed concerns regarding the housing crisis and asked that the Government tackle this.

He referred to HAP as a means of providing temporary housing to suit landlords. Cmhlr

ÓCeallaigh expressed concerns regarding the time frame involved in providing housing and

in particular referred to Keyes Park which has been approved for housing but it will be some

time before the units are built. Cmhlr O’Ceallaigh was critical of the Part 8 process and

referred to Palm Court which has been approved under the Part 8 process but it will be

2021 before funding is received for this development. Cmhlr ÓCeallaigh expressed the

need for more housing projects and the investment that is required in housing. Cmhlr

ÓCeallaigh referred to the need for more housing adaptation grants and how there are

people in care centres unable to return home as their house is not suitable.---

of Sympathy for former Councillor, Leonard Enright, who had passed away. Deep sympathy

was expressed to his wife Birdie, sons Alan, Thomas and David, daughter Mary and

extended family, friends, neighbours and community, for their loss.

The Mayor referred to his sad passing at the age of 65 just hours after he was inducted

into the GAA Hall of Fame. Leonard was inspirational in the Treaty's back-to-back Munster

titles in 1980 and 1981 and was an All-Star in 1980, 1981 and 1983. He captained Limerick

to a National Hurling League title in 1985.

The Mayor spoke of Leonard’s political career when he was first elected to Limerick County

Council for Fianna Fáil in June 1999 and was returned in all subsequent Local Elections until

his retirement from politics in 2014. He was one of 4 Fianna Fáil candidates to be elected in

the Bruff Electoral Area in the Local Elections of 1999. Leonard Enright was returned to

Limerick County Council in June 2004. He contested the 2009 Local Elections, this time in the

newly named and redrawn Adare Electoral Area, and was again returned to the Council.---

The Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. The Members spoke of

the immense respect for Leonard within the Council Chamber, in his wider community and

GAA circles. The Members spoke of his love of the GAA and his contribution to the GAA

over the years. The Members also spoke of his athletic ability and his success as a javelin

thrower and as a sprinter. They recalled Leonard as a gentleman and a man of few words

but a man who contributed in a positive manner and promoted GAA and athletics. Leonard

played a significant contribution to GAA in his own parish of Patrickswell and would be

sadly missed for his positive impact within the community. The Members referred to the

deep sense of sadness when they learned of his passing.

The Chief Executive paid tribute to Leonard, on his own behalf and on behalf of the staff. He

stated that staff recalled Leonard as a gentleman, dignified and his courteous approach to

doing business. The Chief Executive extended sincere sympathy to his family, community and

friends.

At the conclusion of the Meeting, a minute's silence and reflection was observed as a mark

of respect.

This concluded the Meeting.

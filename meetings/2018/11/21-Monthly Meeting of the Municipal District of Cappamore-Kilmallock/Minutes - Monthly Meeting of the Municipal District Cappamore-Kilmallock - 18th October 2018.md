initiatives.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Director, Social Development Directorate and other staff
members of the Directorate to the meeting. A PowerPoint presentation was given to the
Members on Community Development/Town & Village Renewal initiatives including:

¢ Update on Derelict Sites and Vacant Property issues in the Municipal District;
e Update on Town and Village Renewal Scheme 2018;
e¢ Update on funding initiatives.

The Members thanked staff for their presentation, which they said was interesting and
informative and the Director, Social Development Directorate agreed to circulate the
PowerPoint presentation to the Members.

Following a discussion about derelict sites, the Members expressed concern at certain
properties within the Municipal District that had been derelict for a long period of time,
without any apparent action being taken by the local authority, and agreed that these
needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

The Director, Social Development Directorate informed Members his Department have a
range of measures to incentivise owners of derelict properties to remove their properties
from dereliction but that this approach did take time to implement. He advised Members
that he shared their concerns regarding certain derelict properties in the Municipal District
and that Members would see an escalation in properties being tackled going forward.

The Members welcomed this and stressed the importance of enforcement action being
taken urgently against certain owners of derelict properties within the Municipal District
who were not engaging with the local authority.

The Members also welcomed the details of the funding initiatives available and stressed the
importance of communicating the details of these various funding initiatives to the wider
community. They also agreed that it was important that applicants for funding be assisted as
much as possible by the local authority due to the complexity, sometimes, of some of the
forms and information requested to be submitted as part of the grant application process.

Update on Threshold Project in Kilmallock

The Senior Architect gave an update to Members on the Threshold Project in Kilmallock. This
project entailed Limerick City & County Council engaging with Architecture students from the

Kilmallock (around the new footbridge), looking at how this threshold approach to Kilmallock
could be improved.

The project will include the installation of temporary roads realignments, footpaths and
landscape features as well as three temporary Towers- a storytelling tower, a planted tower
and a sheltered seat. The installation will be constructed through a collaborative effort with
the Men’s Shed, the Fab Lab Limerick and local community members.

As part of the installation, it is also intended to measure how the new design of the area
achieves certain defined goals such as the speed of traffic, the number of pedestrians, the
noise and air quality, and the attractiveness of the entry to the town.

The Members thanked the Senior Architect for her presentation and they commended the
project in the way it engaged with students and the local community in a unique way and
agreed that this approach could also be used as a template for other similar projects in the
Municipal District.

Councils Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas

Barry Murphy, A/Senior Executive Engineer briefed the Members on the contents of Limerick
City and County Councils Traffic Calming Policy for Urban Areas.

The Members thanked the A/Senior Executive Engineer for his presentation and welcomed
the policy as it would provide greater clarity and consistency in the provision and
implementation of traffic calming measures throughout the Municipal District.

The Members agreed that the speed of traffic, especially through the towns and villages, was
an ongoing issue for communities and while Garda enforcement action was important, it was
also vital that the local authority had its own traffic calming measures to address the issue of
traffic speed throughout the Municipal District.

4. unicipal District Reception

November, details as follows:

QUESTIONS
5. uestion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District what is the update in taking in charge
of Cluain Foinse Estate in Hospital.

REPLY: A schedule of works has been agreed with the bond holder and we are
awaiting payment of the bond. Once this payment is received, Limerick City &
County Council will arrange for the estate to be completed to a taking in
charge standard. Upon completion of these works, the formal taking in
charge process will be commenced.

6. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District for an update on the speed limit
review and when can we expect the review to be completed.

REPLY: Operations and Maintenance Central Services will be returning to all
Municipal Districts in the next few weeks with a report on the objections and
submissions received as a result of the public consultation of the draft speed
limit bye-laws. Following this, a new revision of the draft bye-laws will be
prepared for submission to the full Council Meeting in either December or

January.
Te Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

| will ask at the next Meeting of the Municipal District that some action be taken to help
with the parking at Cahercorney Graveyard on the R514 road.

REPLY: Cahercorney Graveyard is located on the R514 regional road, approximately
2 km to the north of Herbertstown. The graveyard is now closed to the
public. However, there continues to be a small number of burials each year
for people with family plots.

There is no car parking available at the graveyard. The alignment of the R514
is poor, with bends on either side of the graveyard. The road is narrow with a
continual white line. The nearest safe parking spot is located 200 metres to
the east of the graveyard in front of a private dwelling.

*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

The Council will investigate the option of providing 4-6 car parking spaces at
the graveyard. This will require the acquisition of a small amount of land to
the west of the graveyard and the replacement of the existing hedgerow with
suitable fencing.

It would not be economically viable to widen a longer section of the R514 to
accommodate the very occasional large funeral. However, it would be
possible to provide active traffic managements for funerals. This would
require a traffic management plan agreed with the Kilmallock Roads
Engineer.

In order to progress the provision of car parking spaces, the Area has applied
for funding under the 2019 Low Cost Safety scheme.

Other sed:

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the
following items were raised:

° jion-O’Rourk:

The Members enquired as to why a Notice of Motion relating to O’Rourke’s Cross was not
included on the Agenda for the Meeting. The Meetings Administrator explained that this
Notice of Motion sought to rescind a decision to approve a Part 8 application for O’Rourkes
Cross which was originally made by the Members at the October 2017 Municipal District
Meeting.

The Meetings Administrator confirmed that he had discussed the Notice of Motion with the
Cathaoirleach and the Director, Support Services-Finance, Corporate, HR & ICT and following
these discussions he sought legal advice from the Councils Legal Advisors, which stated as
follows:

“The Members do not have the authority in law to re-consider a decision made in 2017 in

compliance with the provisions of the Planning & Development Act 2000 as amended. The
Members at that time would have been entitled to decide by resolution to vary or modify

the proposal. That entitlement has passed."

Having regard to the legal advice obtained, the Meetings Administrator explained that he
was therefore not in a position to include the Notice of Motion on the Agenda for the
Municipal District Meeting.

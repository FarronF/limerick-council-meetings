At the outset, the Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Meeting.

1. N20 O’Rourke’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme

The Cathaoirleach referred to the Part Vill proposal for the N20 O’Rourke’s Cross Road
Improvement Scheme considered at the Municipal District meeting held on the 19"
October 2017 and also the discussion that took place about same at the July 2018
Municipal District Meeting.

The circumstances of the October 2017 Municipal District Meeting were outlined
regarding the Part Vill N20 O’Rourke’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme. Lengthy
discussions had taken place and the Members indicated that they were told at the time
there could be legal implications on Elected Members if they sought to amend the Part
Vill proposal submitted, by suggesting the alternative of a five-leg roundabout at this
location.

Members referred to TIl guidelines which allow for a five legged roundabout in certain
circumstances and questioned why this could not be applied at O’Rourke’s Cross and
referred to legal advice taken that guidelines are flexible.

The Members referred to the proposal to locate the stop for northbound buses on the
western side of the realigned N20 and their safety concerns regarding it and queried
whether the bus stop could be relocated to the general area close to the parking bays.
Reference was also made to the right-turning lane on the northern side, which the
Members felt could potentially cause tailbacks as large vehicles turned in to the
commercial business.

Councillors also referred to the commercial business at O’Rourke’s Cross which is an
employer and ratepayer in the area and for which this decision may have implications for
the future of this business.

The Cathaoirleach said that following a recent meeting with Planning they had become a
lot more knowledgeable on the Part Vill process. The Members were unanimous in saying
there had been campaigns ongoing for some time seeking safety measures to be installed
at O’Rourke’s Cross, which would make the junction as safe as possible for all road users.

They failed to see how the inclusion of a fifth leg at the roundabout could not be
considered and included in the proposed works and the Members were now requesting
that the Chief Executive consider their request to amend the Part Vill for the N20
O’Rourke’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme following this Special Meeting.

The Chief Executive thanked members and staff for facilitating the Meeting. The Chief
Executive said he understood the N20 O’Rourke’s Cross Road Improvement Scheme Part
VII was a difficult decision but that it had been passed at the October 2017 Municipal
District Meeting and that it would now proceed. He reiterated that it was a matter of
safety for all road users and the reality of the matter was that to install a fifth leg to the
proposed roundabout at this junction would increase the potential for an accident at the
location by 60%.

The Chief Executive stated that the advice of technical staff was that a four-legged
roundabout was safer for all users and would have to be taken on board. However, he
added that works to increase safety at the location in relation to the bus stop would be
looked at. The Chief Executive concluded by saying that taking all this detail into account,
that the Part Vill would proceed as adopted and the proposed works would proceed on
the advice of engineering and TI! staff who had also met with the business owner at
O’Rourke’s Cross.

This concluded the Meeting.

Signed:
Cathaoirleach

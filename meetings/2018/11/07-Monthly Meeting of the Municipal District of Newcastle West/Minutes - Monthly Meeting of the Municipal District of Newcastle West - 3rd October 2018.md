Deputation

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from the Board of Management Killoughteen

National School, Newcastle West. The Deputation consisted of Mr. Willie Curtin, Principal,

and Mr. Padraig Kennedy, Treasurer, Board of Management and Parents Representative.

Mr. Curtin addressed the Meeting and welcomed the opportunity to outline to the Members

the current situation with regard to traffic issues in the vicinity of the school, the funding

required for a pedestrian crossing and the building of a car park. He stated that there are

currently 162 students with 18 staff at the school. He also stated that there would be an

increase in enrolments next year to approximately 180. He mentioned that a new pre-school

along with an ASD class opened in September 2018.

Mr. Curtin also stated that a new extension consisting of two mainstream classrooms has just

been completed and funding has been sanctioned for the school to build a purpose built ASD

class and a school general purpose room/hall. These new projects are to be completed by

Autumn next year. As a result of the above works the car park which is already inadequate

will now be made smaller to accommodate this new ASD building.

He stated that it is the intention of the school to install a car park across the road from the

school, but funding is required for a pedestrian crossing to make this a safe option. A costing

of €44,000 has been received by the school for this work, which would consist of

approximately 40 car park spaces. Mr. Curtin stated that he now wishes to seek assistance to

progress this project.

The Members thanked the delegation and a discussion took place. It was noted that many

other schools are also experiencing similar funding difficulties in this area and it was agreed

by all Members that the Department of Education had a role in these matters and should

provide assistance to schools.

Councillor Galvin proposed a Motion be forwarded to the next Full Meeting of Limerick City

and County Council that the townland of Killoughteen, Newcastle West, which is identified as

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Foley

***I will move at the next Meeting that the funding which is being proposed for the new***

***development of houses at New Street and Colbert Road, Abbeyfeale, should instead be***

***made available to purchase the former Council houses known as Colbert Terrace,***

***Abbeyfeale, as these houses are derelict and an eye sore.***

Residents Associations felt they would not be in a position to support the Part VIII for this

proposed development.

Councillor Browne proposed that funding be made available to develop the area of

Colbert Terrace by purchasing and regenerating the derelict properties in the estate as

opposed to constructing social housing at the Colbert Street junction.

In replying, the Director of Services agreed the traffic management issues at Colbert Street

and New Street needed to be addressed and it was envisaged that the housing issues at this

location be addressed in unison. The Director informed Members that the derelict sites at

Colbert Terrace were actively being pursued.

in parallel.

Meeting to discuss various issues.

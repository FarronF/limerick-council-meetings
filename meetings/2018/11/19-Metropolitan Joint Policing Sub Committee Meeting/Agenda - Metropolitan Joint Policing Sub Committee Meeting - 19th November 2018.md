3. Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller :

| will ask at the next Meeting that ‘Go Safe’ speed monitoring vans be located on the
Bloodmill Road, Castletroy View, opposite the entrance to Springfield Shopping Complex.
Such ‘Go Safe’ vans to record inbound speeding traffic heading towards the Childers Road
and to record those that do not stop at pedestrian crossing as the speed limit of 50 km per
hour for that road is being ignored continuously by a considerable number of drivers
approaching the pedestrian crossing.

4. To receive update from A/Superintendent Luke Conlon.

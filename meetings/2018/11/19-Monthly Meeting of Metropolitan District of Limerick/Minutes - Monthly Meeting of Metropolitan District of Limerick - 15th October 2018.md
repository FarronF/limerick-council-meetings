**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will*** ***ask for details of rates from planning permissions outstanding from property developers***

***in the Metropolitan area and to list the names of these developers.***

**REPLY:**

Seventeen multi-unit residential developments with development contributions in

the Metropolitan area commenced between 1st June 2014 and 31st August 2018.

Approx. €2.36 million remains outstanding in respect of these permissions.

Of these developments:
---
3

Fifteen have payment plans in place;

Two are subject to further discussion on their contributions.

As all other developments are either the subject of an agreement or subject of

discussion, it would not be appropriate to name them at this time.

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next meeting for full information in terms of planned Rapid Build housing***

***projects planned for the Metropolitan District including materials to be used, if the tendering***

***process has begun, intended cost, what guarantees there are from the companies involved***

***regarding durability, especially if the companies involved wind up. Also, it has been stated it***

***will take 11 to 12 months construction of these projects in Limerick, but similar schemes in***

***Dublin are planned to take under 8 months, so I would like clarification as to timescale for***

***construction as well.***

**REPLY:**

**Rapid Build housing projects planned for the Metropolitan District**

Lisheen Park, Patrickswell

16 units

Barnakyle, Patrickswell

24 units

(Old Christians, Rathbane, Limerick, 43 units, is a Design and Build contract which

is, in theory, the same as a Rapid Build contract)

**Materials to be used**

As this is effectively a Design and Build contract, tendering contractors are invited

to propose solutions and systems that will expedite construction and cost.

**Tendering Process**

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has established a framework for

the procurement of construction work in relation to the provision of Rapid Delivery

Housing projects. A panel consisting of 12 contracting firms (framework members)

was established.

When a Local Authority decides to procure works, an invitation is sent through

eTenders to each Framework Member to tender in a mini-competition having

regard to the guidance and standard suite of documents developed under the

Capital Works Management Framework.

Prior to inviting framework members to tender, the Works Requirements must be

provided through drawings, schedules and specifications to provide sufficient

information for the framework members to tender. In Limerick, preparation of the

Works Requirements documentation has begun for those housing projects that

have received Part 8 Approval.

**Intended Cost**

Current projected costs for each project are as determined at Stage 2 Approval. As

with all construction projects, construction cost is subject to become more defined

following Tender.

Lisheen Park sanctioned costs €3,700,000
---
4

Barnakyle sanctioned costs €4,821,800

**Guarantee from Companies involved regarding durability**

Two of the mandatory award criteria in a framework mini-competition Invitation

to Tender include

- Design Approach (10-30%)

- Durability (10-30%)

To comply with this, Framework Members who wish to be considered for a Works

Contract must demonstrate in their response to the mini-competition how all

proposed works comply with the applicable Irish Building Regulations.

All Framework Members and their proposed design and construction processes

must conform to all applicable Irish legislation. Particular attention is drawn to the

Irish Building Regulations, Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities – Design

Guidelines 2007 and the requirement that key elements of the construction are to

have a durability in the order of 60 years with a normal level of maintenance.

Where works involve systems products, materials, techniques or equipment, for

which published national standards do not yet exist, Framework Members must

provide third party certification demonstrating compliance with Irish Building

Regulations and durability requirements. Such certification may include, in part or

in total, a European Technical Assessment or Agrément certification (e.g. NSAI

Agrément) or equivalent.

**Company Closure**

Tenderers to join the framework were assessed under the Tenderers Personal

Situation, Financial and Economic Standing, amongst other criteria, thus reducing

risk in terms of company financial robustness, etc.

The Framework Agreement sets out specific performance measurement criteria.

The OGP may review the Framework Member’s performance of its Works

Contracts and the Framework Agreement at the end of each year of the

Framework Period, according to these Performance Measurement criteria, with

threat of elimination from panel.

**Timescale for construction**

Lisheen Park Commencement

October 2018

Substantial completion

September 2019

Barnakyle

Commencement

August 2019

Substantial completion

April 2020

While the title ‘Rapid Build’ suggests expedited construction, the true acceleration

of time is at the procurement stage, whereby:

- the Framework Panel has already been established by the Minister for Public

Expenditure and Reform, effectively reducing a two-stage tendering process to a

single-stage tendering process; and

- the Information included in the Works Requirements is less than that required

when following traditional procurement routes.

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update in terms of tackling voids in the Metropolitan***

Government during August 2018 to commence works on 70 voids to a value of

€1.4m, of which €1.1m is grant funded and the balance to be funded from Council

resources.

To date, 18 units have been completed and works (such as specifications,

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on plans that the Council have for facilitating***

There are approx. 3,000 on-street paid car parking spaces in Limerick City of which

approx. 900 spaces are located in the core city centre. Many of these on-street

spaces are free of charge at weekends. There are approx. 5,500 off-street car

parking spaces provided by private car park operators in Limerick City Centre.

These car parking spaces are very important in supporting the city economy.

In relation to Christmas, the Council will provide support through additional free

car parking spaces in the run up to the festive season. For Christmas 2017 the

Council developed and provided additional free car parking at the vacant Cleeves

Factory Site and at City Hall. This proved very beneficial, was well supported and

will be repeated in 2018. The Council is also currently examining other possible

sites that may also be made available for Christmas.

Separately, the Council is also working with bus operators to run increased services

in the lead up to Christmas that will offer shoppers and visitors the option to access

the city via public transport.

The Christmas in Limerick Program will be officially unveiled on the 18th November

and details of parking and public transport for Limerick City Centre will be included.

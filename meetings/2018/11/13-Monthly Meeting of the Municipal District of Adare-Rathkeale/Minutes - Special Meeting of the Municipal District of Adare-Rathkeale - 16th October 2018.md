**Deputation**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from the Askeaton Community Council and

introduced all Council officials present.

The Chairperson of Askeaton Community Council advised Members he had forwarded an

Agenda for discussion. The following issues were highlighted by the group:

**1.Speed Ramps, Parking and Road Markings**

 Speed ramps in the town are not effective and need to be replaced on

William Street, Main Street and Saint Mary’s Terrace.

 Double yellow lines needed at junctions around the town especially at the

Post Office on Saint Mary’s Terrace.

 Mirror needed at the junction of the Quay to East Square.

 Signage needed on Plunkett Road to stop trucks using it as a shortcut to get

onto the N69.

**2.Street Cameras**

 3 cameras have been installed in the town, when will they go live and when

will the other 3 cameras be installed.

**3.Reilig Mhuire Burial Ground**

 The cross near the lower wall fell a number of years ago and the Community

Council were told it would be re-erected. This has never happened and now

has weeds growing over it. The Rosary will be held in the Burial Ground in

November at the cross and they would like the cross to be in place for this.

Also they would like a timeline for when the Burial Ground extension will

go ahead.

at the junction beside the bridge.

and monitored in the Moyross Centre in Limerick. This CCTV footage can be accessed by

the Gardaí if needed. The Head of Digital Strategy added that the funding provided by the

Department of Justice in 2017 had only allowed for the provision of 3 cameras in

Askeaton, however, if further funding was provided by the Department of Justice a 4th

camera would be installed.

Members of the Askeaton Community Council thanked the Councillors and Officials for

the opportunity to raise their concerns and welcomed the proposal of a private workshop.

A presentation was given to Members to update them on derelict sites, vacant properties,

the Town and Village Renewal Scheme 2018 and funding initiatives.

Following a discussion Members expressed concern at the level of dereliction in Rathkeale

that needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The Director, Social Development

Directorate informed Members his Department have a range of measures to incentivise

owners of derelict properties to remove their properties from dereliction, however, this

approach is a slow time consuming process. The Director, Social Development Directorate

also informed Members he shared their concerns and added the scale of the problem is

quite significant, however, Members would see an escalation in properties being tackled

going forward.

Members thanked the Council Officials for their presentation and suggested a workshop

be adopted to discuss this matter further.

The Cathaoirleach requested that Item 10, Water Quality Issues in Rathkeale, would be

taken as the next Item. This was agreed by Members.

**10.**

**Water Quality Issues in Rathkeale**

Councillor Teskey referred to the recent water issues in Rathkeale and the surrounding

areas and expressed concern and annoyance at the response to the matter by Irish

Water. Discussion ensued and all Members were in agreement the response to the

matter by Irish Water had not been adequate.

Councillor McMahon proposed a letter be forwarded to Irish Water expressing the

Members dissatisfaction with the handling of the recent water issue in the District. This

was seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue. Councillor O’Donoghue called again for Irish

Water to be abolished and the power to manage water and waste water returned to the

Local Authorities.

Councillor Sheahan proposed Limerick City and County Council conduct an independent

survey throughout the City and County to ascertain where lead pipes have been used in

the water system. This was seconded by Councillor Teskey.

The Director, National and Regional Shared Services Centre informed Members a vote

had taken place at the September Meeting to abolish Irish Water and as this vote was

defeated a vote cannot be cast again for six months. The Director also advised Members

the lead pipes survey is not an issue for Limerick City and County Council and should be

referred to Irish Water. Councillor Sheahan asked the motion be referred to Irish Water.

Following the conclusion of Item 10, The Cathaoirleach proposed to close the Monthly

Meeting to facilitate the Workshop and Special Meeting for discussion of the Draft

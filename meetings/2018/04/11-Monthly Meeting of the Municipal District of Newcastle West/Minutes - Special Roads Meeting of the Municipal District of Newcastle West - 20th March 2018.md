At the outset of the meeting, the Cathaoirleach and Members extended their condolences

and sympathy to Ms. A. Lenihan, on her recent bereavement.

The Members noted that due to the harsh winter the condition of roads within the District

had deteriorated. They referred to the Schedule of Works for the Municipal District of

Newcastle West, which had been adopted at the March Monthly Meeting and stated that this

would address some of the roadways requiring attention. However, a report detailing roads,

which require repairs following the poor weather conditions, should be complied and

submitted to the Department of Transport in order to seek additional funding.

Discussion also took place on pipe laying by Gas Networks Ireland and in some instances, road

reinstatement works are poor. Surface water and blocked drainage gullies on roadways were

also highlighted as a contributing factor to deteriorating road surfaces. The Members stated

that more resurfacing works were required and the repair process for fixing potholes was also

discussed. The Members said that the Council Roads crews are trying to keep roads in a good

condition but additional resources are required given the level of necessary repairs.

In response, the A/Senior Engineer, (Roads) stated that issues with Gas Networks Ireland

reinstatement works would be highlighted with them and rectified. He also noted that crews

had spent 70 nights salting excluding works which were carried out during Storm Emma. The

level of rainfall over the past few months was also noted along with the increase in funding

made available through grants and the budget process. He stated that 80km of roadway was

surface dressed in 2017 and 95km of roadway would be surface dressed in 2018.---
Discussion also took place on the possibility of appointing a Clerk of Works to oversee projects

by third parties in order to ensure that road reinstatement works are carried out correctly.

The Members also queried whether there was sufficient staff available to complete repair

works and whether the Council was receiving its fair share of grants from the Department.

Heavy machinery damaging road verges was also noted.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that based on the budgets available there was sufficient

staff and also said that some of the drainage issues on roads were as a result of water coming

off land where internal drains were not being maintained.

The A/Senior Engineer (Roads) stated that a report would be complied on roadways requiring

repairs due to the poor weather for submission to the Department in order to seek additional

funding.

This concluded the Meeting.

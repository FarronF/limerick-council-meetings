**Item 3**

To consider adjourned Notice of Motion referred from full Council meeting on the 22nd

of January 2018:

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor V. Crowley:

““*That this Local Authority will no longer approve planning on sites where there is a*

*live infestati**on of Japanese knotweed.”*

Many committee members spoke of the destructive nature of the Japanese

knotweed and other species and laid out their concerns in relation to their impact on

the built environment, ecology and the environment generally. A number of

Councillors felt that the way to tackle the issue was to restrict planning approval for

the development on sites and lands affected by knotweed. However, there was a

general consensus that this approach, if applied would be too restrictive and would

be a serious impediment to the development of sites for housing etc. particularly in

rural locations. A more cautionary planning approach was recommended.

The meeting was briefed on the approach that the Planning Dept. uses when dealing

with infected sites. Two staff member have been specifically trained in species

identification. Planning applications cannot proceed to completion without a

treatment programme of treatment from a suitable expert being submitted by the

applicant. Once submitted the programme is incorporated into a planning condition

attaching to the permission.

Member were generally in favour of this approach as it dealt with instances of

infestation on a case by case basis. The Council undertook to monitor the

effectiveness of the process and will review if necessary.

**Culture & Arts Directorate**

**GMA – Festival Funding 2018 in relation to investment in Riverfest 2018**

A presentation to the Elected members by Ms. Sheila Deegan, Culture and Arts Officer and

Ms. Laura Ryan, Head of Marketing and Communications outlined the following key points:-

• The Council’s Cultural Strategy, adopted by the Members, is committed to growing

large scale festivals.

• Riverfest is Limerick’s largest civic festival with 85,000 attending in 2017.

• River activity was increased in 2017 to include 16 individual water activity events.

• The Festival site was expanded to Howley’s Quay in 2017.

• Riverfest Limerick’s social media campaign generated 1,062,956 paid impressions.

• Riverfest won 3 Irish Events Industry awards and was shortlisted for the Chambers

Ireland Festival award in 2017.

• Riverfest programme currently includes multiple strategic partnerships including Bon

Secours Hospital Great Limerick Run, Dolans Warehouse, King John’s Castle and

additional partnerships proposed in 2018 include Swimmable Limerick and Croí Glas.

• Additional programme that GMA funding of €30,000 might facilitate include double zip

wire, audience survey, street performers, extreme water sports demonstrations and

potentially, outdoor movies.

Members welcomed the success of Riverfest and suggested that additional activities could be

added in the future including extending the zip wire from King John’s Castle to the Treaty

Stone, outdoor cinemas, the establishment of a sports arena for water related activities and

promoting Limerick as a triathlon venue. Members expressed disappointment that not all

businesses support the festivals in the city and highlighted the lack of flags and green bunting

on some city centre premises during the Saint Patrick’s Festival weekend. In response to

queries in relation to Limerick being included as a destination on the Wild Atlantic Way route,

Laura Ryan informed the meeting that there was an opportunity to leverage the brand for the
---

wider catchment area and discussions were ongoing regarding Limerick as a pilot city as a

Gateway for the new Wild Atlantic Way Region. Members also suggested that there should

be pedestrian access from Howley’s Quay to King John’s Castle during the festival. In this

regard, the gate on Sylvester O’Halloran Bridge should remain open.

Members noted that the funding approved as part of the budgetary process was increased in

2018 from €116,107 to €148,000. Concern was expressed by some Members on the request

to the General Municipal Allocation (GMA) funding as they believed that the primary objective

of this funding should be to assist in establishing new festivals for the city. Members also

expressed disappointment at the lack of national funding and in particular, festival funding

from Fáilte Ireland. Following further discussion in relation to funding of festivals in the City,

it was agreed to invite Fáilte Ireland to the April Metropolitan Meeting.

On the proposal of Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Collins, Members approved

funding of €30,000 GMA funding for the 2018 Riverfest Festival.

**Presentation on Richard Harris Film Festival**

Zeb Moore, Festival Organiser, Richard Harris Film Festival and Rob Gill, Chairman of the Board

of Directors gave an overview to the Members of the festival which included the following

points:-

• The festival had grown from a one day to a five day event and screenings were now

held on the city’s main cultural venues including Millennium Theatre, Belltable,

University Concert Hall and Limetree Theatre.

• The film festival was in its sixth year and was now IFTA affiliated.

• In 2017 there were 28 films shown and 3,000 attendees.

• Richard Harris Film Festival was now represented at many major international film

festivals.

• The longer-term plan was to scale the festival so that it was either self-financing or

have its costs defrayed by a title sponsor.

Members welcomed the festival as an opportunity to showcase Limerick as a destiny for

independent film production. Members noted in particular the benefit of the Council decision

to purchase Troy Studios, which provided the opportunities for film production in Limerick,

and enabled Limerick to be Ireland’s film capital. In this regard, Mr. Moore referenced

upcoming potential film projects that were being finalised for location in Limerick.

Members noted how last year’s investment of €30,000 paid off and were unanimous in their

support of the Film Festival. It was agreed that, following on from this presentation and in

line with normal protocol, the request for funding would be referred to the appropriate

channel for consideration.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to** **provide details of the funding allocation**

**made in 2017 to replace the old SOX bulbs (when needing repair through failure) with the**

**new LED street lights. How much of this allocationwas spent in 2017 replacing the old bulbs.**

**REPLY:**

The allocation for Public Lighting Maintenance made each year by the Council

is for the maintenance of the entire stock of public lighting including SOX, SONs,

CFLs, Halogens, and LEDs as well as switch gear, lighting columns and outreach

brackets.

Therefore, there is not a specific allocation targeted towards SOX Bulb

replacement only. The Budget in 2017 for Public Lighting for Energy Costs,

repairs and Renewals was €1,800,000

Philips the dominant manufacturer has announced that it will phase out the

production of SOX Bulbs from July 2019 due to the growth in use of the more

energy efficient LEDs. There are still some supplies of SOX replacement Bulbs

available but stocks will be limited going forward. Therefore, over the next few

years Councils will have to look at replacing their network of SOX Lanterns with

LEDs.

In 2017 the Council carried out works on over 2100 SOX Lanterns, of these the

Bulb was replaced in approx. 1,385 and 715 SOX Lanterns were replaced with

new LED lanterns at a cost of circa €225,000

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

**I will ask at the next Meeting** **for the Council to provide a current status of the proposed**

**schedule to complete Phase 2 of the refurbishment work in the Watergate Flats Complex.**

**Has all the required funding been provided. Maintenance issues in Tara Court have been**

**placed on hold for the last number of years with the expectation that the refurbishment**

**work would address most of the serious issues.**

**REPLY:**

The deep retrofit of the 100 unit Watergate Flats complex is being delivered on

a phased basis. Phase 1 (56 units) was completed in 2017. This work has
---

significantly enhanced the performance, comfort levels and visual amenity of

these buildings. Part-funding has been confirmed by the Department of

Housing, Planning and Local Government for Phase 2 of the project i.e. 44 units.

Part-funding has also been committed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of

Ireland (SEAI) under the Better Energy Communities Programme 2018. It is

envisaged that work will commence on Phase 2 this year.

Operations and Maintenance, Service Operations are responding to routine

maintenance requests from tenants in Tara Court.

Limerick City and County Council has appointed two Access Officers, Geraldine

Dollard and Aoibhe Reidy to oversee the delivery of the Council’s

Federation of Ireland (DFI) and the following actions have been agreed for 2018.
---

• Limerick City and County Council has agreed a work placement programme

with Employability Limerick and 4/5 persons with disabilities will be hosted

on an 8 week work experience programme in the Council over the Summer.

• Limerick City and County Council are working closely with DFI to identify

ways the Council can support and promote the Make Way Day. A date has

not be identified yet and DFI are drawing up proposals at present.

• The Council will organise Awareness training (on the needs of customers

with disabilities) for Limerick City and County Council frontline staff over the

coming months.

• A disability section on Limerick.ie will be set up and updated regularly.

In addition to the above specific initiatives, the Access Officers are working

closely with the members of the DFI and others who raise issues in relation

to access to services and facilities in the City and County. Contact has been

made with the Area Engineers in relation to obstructions on footpaths in the

City and County towns.

Members noted the need for increased awareness of this issue and Councillor Hurley

suggested that this could be discussed in detail at a Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) Meeting.

The Mayor noted that he had also raised this issue in a previous Notice of Motion and the

Meetings Administrator informed the meeting that a reply had been received from the Office

of the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, which was included with the

correspondence for this meeting.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors E. Secas**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Council bring forward for consideration the road**

**improvement scheme for the R445 road from the Kilmurray Roundabout eastwards, which**

**was developed by Consultant Engineers Mott McDonald in 2016.**

The Mayor informed the Meeting that this item would be forwarded to the Local Electoral

Area Briefings.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

**I will move at the next meeting that more detailed responses, and more frequent updates**

**be given to local representatives on the MyLimerick system.**

The Motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh referred to ongoing issues with the communication around the MyLimerick

system. In particular, he stated that the status of the query was frequently incorrect and there

appeared to be a lack of accountability. In this regard he asked that the system be examined

to see if it can be upgraded so that it is interactive and also, that a review is carried out of the

practice of closing cases with the status commitment given, as this means that there was no

follow up to ensure that the action was carried out.

Following further discussion the Meetings Administrator noted the issues raised and agreed

to discuss them with relevant staff and revert to the Members with an update once the review

was complete.

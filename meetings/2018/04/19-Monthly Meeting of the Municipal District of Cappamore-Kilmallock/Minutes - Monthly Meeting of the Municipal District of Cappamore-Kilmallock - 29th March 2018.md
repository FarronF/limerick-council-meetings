NOTICE OF MOTION

3.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District campaign for the inclusion of Ardpatrick***

***in the CLÁR programme to avail of grant monies to invest in the community.***

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Padraig Malone, Administrative Officer, Social

Development, to the Meeting.

At the outset of discussion on this item, the Director asked the Administrative

Officer, Social Development, to outline his views on the issue.

The Administrative Officer, Social Development, confirmed that it was not possible

to include Ardpatrick in the CLÁR Programme for 2018 as the CLÁR District Electoral Division

(DED) areas had been set out by the Department in relation to rural areas that had suffered

the greatest levels of population decline, and this was based on previous Census of

Population figures. However, he did confirm that the Department had indicated that there

might be a review of the CLÁR Scheme later in 2018 and that would be the opportunity to

give consideration to other DED areas possibly being considered for inclusion in the CLÁR

Programme.

He went on to explain that applications were now being sought under CLÁR for 2018

and that the two measures where funding could be applied for were as follows:



Measure 1: Support for Schools/Community Safety Measures;



Measure 2: Support for Play Areas, including Multi-Use Games Areas (MUGA).

He also clarified that there was a third Measure Category called ‘First Response

Support Measure’ where applications would be accepted directly by the Department from

established organisations that operated entirely on a voluntary basis and were involved in

emergency rescue/first response efforts. The Department would disseminate information

regarding this Measure and would liaise directly with potential qualifying groups.

The Department had also indicated that the maximum number of applications that

could be submitted by each Local Authority was 15 and, for 2018, the Department had

proposed an allocation of €5m.

He confirmed that application forms for both Measures 1 and 2 were now available

and that the details of this year's scheme were available on the Limerick.ie website. The

closing date for receipt of completed applications was Friday, 20th April, 2018, and these

should be returned to the Kilmallock District Office, Kilmallock, Co. Limerick.

The Members thanked the Administrative Officer, Social Development, for his

update on the CLÁR Programme and welcomed the proposed funding for 2018. However,

there was agreement amongst the Members that the criteria for selecting DED areas under

this Programme needed to be reviewed as simply basing it on population decline was not a

fair yardstick or measure, and that additional criteria should also be considered when

determining DED areas for inclusion in the CLÁR Programme.

Members welcomed the fact that the Department had indicated that a review of the

CLÁR Scheme would be considered later in 2018 and requested that they be consulted again

when such a review was taking place. The Administrative Officer, Social Development,

agreed to return to a future Meeting to brief the Members at that stage.

2.

Schedule of Works for the Municipal District

Circulated, report from the Director, Support Services, dated 12th March, 2018,

setting out details in relation to the Draft Schedule of Works for the Municipal District of

Cappamore-Kilmallock 2018.

The Director confirmed that the funding allocation for the 2018 Schedule of Works

for the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock represented an overall increase in

funding of approximately €600,000 over the 2017 allocation, which was very welcome.

The Members welcomed the increase in the funding allocation for 2018 and, in

particular, the new specific allocation in 2018 of a Drainage Grant that could be used for the

alleviation of road drainage problems in the Municipal District area, having regard to the

very poor weather experienced in recent months which had had such an effect on the road

network throughout the Municipal District area.

Proposed by Councillor Teefy;

Seconded by Councillor Gleeson;

And Resolved:

“That, the Schedule of Works for the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock, as

circulated, be adopted.”

Members thanked staff for their work in compiling the Schedule of Works.

Other Matters Raised:

At the conclusion of the Agenda and with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the

following items were raised:

 **Part 8 Applications under the Planning and Development Acts**

The Members discussed the position regarding Part 8 applications and their legal

obligations and requirements in dealing with same at their Municipal District Meetings.

They agreed that clarification should be sought as to what options were open and available

to the Members when dealing with a Part 8 application.

 **New Roads Engineer for the Municipal District**

The Members welcomed Diarmuid Sheehy to the Municipal District of Cappamore-

Item 3: National Development Plan 2018-2027
Overview of Housing Issues

Ms. Sarah Newell, Executive Planner, gave a presentation on the National Development Plan
2018-2027 outlining the focus for investment over the next 10 years including (1) the
projects that will benefit Limerick, (2) Urban Regeneration and Development, (3) Local
Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund/Affordable Sites, (3) New Regeneration and
Development Fund, (4) National Regeneration and Development Agency, (5) Rebuilding
Ireland Programme and (6) Limerick’s targets under Rebuilding Ireland.

A discussion took place with issues raised relating to the following:

One off rural housing and the perceived restriction on rural growth. Ms. Newell advised that the
Draft National Planning Framework (NPF) had explicitly said there must be a demonstrable
‘economic need’ but this had been revised in the final NPF to include both ‘economic and social
need’.

Rural Regeneration and the smaller tier settlements in County Limerick where there is significant
demand in terms of housing need but which do not have the required infrastructure to activate, The
Oola/Hospital waste water treatment plant was given as an example in relation to capacity
issues restricting growth. Ms Newell advised of a dedicated Government fund, the Rural
Regeneration and Development Fund, in the National Development Plan with an allocation of €1
billion and that funding will be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid based approach. Ms.
Newell stated that formal notification on this Fund is awaited from the Government. In addition, a
fund of €6.8 billion over the period 2018-2027 has been identified in the National Development Plan
for Sustainable Management of Water and other Environmental Resources with Irish Water.

Cllr. J. Scanian proposed that a joint meeting of the Planning and Housing SPCs was
desirable given the overlap of responsibilities.

Mr. Seamus Hanrahan advised of two Government Programmes which address the under-
occupied properties and that the Council was actively engaged in both the Buy and Renew
and the Repair and Lease programmes. Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) has
purchased a number of properties in poor condition. The Repair and Lease scheme has
been made more attractive reducing the term to 5 years from 10 years. He confirmed 71
units had been acquired with a portion under the Buy and Renew programme which were in
bad condition and generally detracting from their environs. The refurbishment timeframes
following acquisition are 5-6 months given the state of disrepair. LCCC are expected to
purchase more in the future.

The number of vacant houses and the audit on vacant properties was discussed and the
need to focus on areas where there is a high need. The identification of rural areas for Buy
and Renew was discussed.

Cllr. J. Costelloe enquired about the progress with Cosgrave Park, St. Anne’s Court and the
CHAS Flats. Mr. Seamus Hanrahan advised that the Cosgrave Park construction budget is

---

currently being assessed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government
(DHPLG). St. Anne’s Court is owned by the St. Vincent de Paul and is undergoing the
acquisition process. CHAS Flats is at Part 8 public display and will be presented to the
Metropolitan meeting shortly for a decision.

Cllr. M. Donegan expressed his concern that the Council does not have a specific plan for
rural Limerick similar to the specific plans for Limerick City such as the Limerick
Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) and Limerick 2030 and if funding is
available, a deliverable plan should be put in place. He also agreed that there should be a
joint meeting of the Planning and Housing SPCs.

Cllr. Leddin congratulated all involved in the Lord Edward Street and Hyde Road projects
(Park View Row) and noted the positive public response.

Further discussion on the audit on vacant properties took place with suggestions that local
communities and Education Institutions be engaged to assist with the audit. Mr. S.
Hanrahan advised that an Urban and Village Renewal Team had been put in place with
empty homes officers appointed for each Municipal district to identify vacant/derelict
properties and their owners. It was agreed that a presentation from this team would be
requested for the next SPC meeting.

Cllr. Sheehy suggested that students should be engaged to carry out a survey which would
enhance and strengthen the team’s resources to complete the task. Mr. S. Hanrahan
advised there was a national website on vacant/derelict sites, available at
www.vacanthomes.ie that encourages the general public to submit data on vacant homes.

The derelict sites levy was discussed and Mr. Hanrahan agreed that the fines could be more
substantial and that the vacant sites levy was being increased from 3% to 7%.

Item 4: Housing Summit — January 2018
Overview of Key Issues

Mr. Seamus Hanrahan gave an update on the second Housing Summit. Items covered
included:

¢ Level of funding available over a 5 year spending programme. This is the first year of
a multi-annual programme and the range in capital spend ranges €1.6 billion to €2.2

to determine what is reasonable.

Mr. S. Hanrahan advised in relation to Adare that there are 30 units being built, 5 serviced
sites designated and expressions of interest relating to the sale of the remainder of the site
were complete with the best and final bid process to follow. He also advised the line of the
new sewer had to be upgraded to connect back in a manner which would open up as much
of a land bank (and adjacent land banks) as possible. An update on the process will be
included on the Agenda for the next meeting.

treatment plant for all. Mr. S. Hanrahan advised the Council are in discussions with Irish
Water on this issue.

He stated the majority of inspections in 2016 were on HAP properties and explained what
‘fail’ means in terms of non-compliance with the standards. He stated that while a
substantial number of properties were non-compliant, they were for minor reasons.

Item 7: Notices of Motion referred to the Home and Social Development SPC

In the absence of Cllr. Prendiville, the Notice of Motion submitted by him referred from the
December 2017 meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick was deferred to the next
meeting of the SPC and An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. W. O'Donnell proposed to take the Notice of
Motion submitted by Cmhir. 6 Ceallaigh at this time as it related to standards for rental
accommodation as follows:

‘I move at the next Meeting that this Council utterly condemn the letting of substandard
accommodation, both publicly and privately, and commit to ensuring that its own housing
stock is up to standard, as well as ensuring that appropriate action is taken against landlords
letting substandard accommodation.’

A discussion took place with issues raised relating to the following:
¢ Need to look at the Council’s own stock and ensure equity and balance with the
Council's own stock and HAP/RAS;
Non-compliance rates;
The need to ensure people are getting a good service and all properties both public
and private are up to standard; and
¢ Non-compliance with fire standards and the resolution process.

Mr. D. McGuigan advised the scope of the unit deals with private rented accommodation.
AHB's fall under the Regulations also and there were ongoing rolling inspections. He
confirmed there are higher level requirements for multi units and the Council is rigorous in
recording all details and if an issue relating to Fire standards is reported, it is referred to the
Fire Department as appropriate. He also advised that RAS/HAP/Lease are governed by the
Residential Tenancies Board.

Cllr. Scanian wished to be associated with the Notice of Motion.
The Notice of Motion was seconded by Clir. Costello and An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. W.

Update - O’Connell Street Limerick Project

The Senior Executive Officer, Design and Delivery, gave a PowerPoint presentation

updating the Members on the redevelopment scheme for O’Connell Street, Limerick. He

outlined the timeframe involved in the process and the five options following the Council’s

second public consultation phase. He informed the Members that the next step was to

submit an Environmental Impact Assessment Report to An Bord Pleanála.

The Members welcomed the O’Connell Street project. However, they raised queries

in relation to progress to date, the length of time the project would take to complete and

the impact this would have on retailers. Members were also disappointed that, as a result

of the screening process, the planning decision would now be made by An Bord Pleanála.

In response, the Senior Executive Officer confirmed that following an assessment of

the criteria set out in Schedule 7 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, it was

considered that the proposal had the potential to cause significant effects in terms of traffic,

protected structures and socio-economic impacts such as tourism and trade. This, taken

together with the cumulative impact of other developments, meant that it was necessary

for an Environmental Impact Assessment Report instead of the Part 8 Planning process.

Orders were suspended in order to complete the Agenda.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt

with:

9.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will ask at the next Meeting** **for a definitive date when works will begin and are**

**envisaged to be completed on the collapsed wall and footpath next to the playground in**

**Castleconnell.**

**REPLY:**

The location of this work alongside the River Shannon is in a Special Area of

Conservation and an Appropriate Assessment was required and has just been

completed. Limerick City and County Council is inviting tenders for this work---
17

on Monday, 28th May, 2018. The tender period will be 2 weeks approx. The

work associated with the building of the wall should commence during July

2018 and the contract period is envisaged to be up to 3 weeks.

10.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will ask at the next Meeting for a definitive date when Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae**

**Luimnigh will introduce its Choice-Based Letting Housing System.**

**REPLY:**

The implementation of a Choice-based Letting Housing System is currently

being examined with a view to activation in Quarter 4, 2018. A Choice-Based

Letting Housing System may operate initially on a pilot basis, targeting low

demand areas to measure its effectiveness. A Workshop for Elected

Members to discuss the objectives and procedures will take place prior to

implementation.

NOTICES OF MOTION

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors. K. Sheahan, S. Keary, C.

McMahon, E. O’Brien, R. O’Donoghue, A. Teskey

**We will move at the next Meeting that the Local Authority of Limerick City and County**

**Council immediately commence the harmonisation of housing rent payable by tenants**

**between City and County.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (K) and seconded by Councillor

O’Donoghue.

**REPLY:**

The rent of local authority tenants in Ireland is calculated in accordance with

the provisions of what is known as a Differential Rents Scheme. Each Local

Authority adopts, by Executive Order, its own such Scheme, but they all share

similar characteristics. The rent is calculated as a proportion of the assessable

income of the principal earner, together with a contribution from any

subsidiary earners in the household. The significant advantage that this

confers on Local Authority tenants over their counterparts in the private

sector is that the rent is based solely on the income of the household and is

not linked to prevailing market forces. The amount payable will vary up or

down in line with income changes of the occupants. At the moment, the

average rent payable by tenants across the entire administrative area of

Limerick City and County Council is just over €50 per week.

While all Differential Rent Schemes are broadly similar in terms of the general

principles outlined above, each Local Authority would have customised its

Scheme to best suit its circumstances and needs. When the new Local

Authority was created for Limerick in June 2014, the Schemes for both

Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council were carried forward and

continued to apply. It would clearly have been desirable to design and adopt---
18

one uniform Scheme for the entire administrative area. However, it was

decided not to proceed with this on the basis that the Department was

clearly indicating that the Minister intended to roll out a Scheme which

would apply nationally and would replace any existing local Schemes. Despite

such indications continuing, there are still no concrete proposals emerging

for such a step. Having regard to this and the need to remove any anomalies

in the existing Scheme in this Authority, the Social Directorate has

established a Single Differential Rents Scheme Working Group to review

same. Members will, of course, be consulted accordingly as part of the next

budgetary process.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors M. Collins, F. Foley, J.

Scanlan, L. Galvin, J. Sheahan and S. Browne

***We will move at the next Meeting that additional funding be sought for road***

***repairs within the Municipal District of Newcastle West due to the damage caused by***

***harsh weather conditions.***

Councillor Sheahan (J), in proposing the Motion, expressed extreme concern over

the condition of the roads, not just in the Municipal District of Newcastle West, but also

throughout the County, due to the recent bad weather.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins (M).

A discussion took place on the deteriorating condition of roads throughout Limerick

due to the severe weather events which had been occurring and also the lack of capital

investment in the roads infrastructure.

The Director, Physical Development, agreed with the Members that road conditions

had deteriorated due to the extreme weather events of the past winter. Every effort was

being made to maintain the road network to the best standard having regard to the

resources available to the Council.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Ryan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the operational areas would coincide exactly with***

***each electoral area.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ryan and seconded by Councillor Collins (M).

The Chief Executive acknowledged the concerns of the Members in relation to the

operational areas. He informed the Members that a review of same would be considered,

subject to Budget Allocation. He stated that while the Members might not agree with the

current structure, services were being delivered efficiently.---
19

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors J. Scanlan and L. Galvin

***We will move at the next Meeting that responsibility for management of Housing for the***

***County Town be driven from the Mu**nicipal Office locally.***

Councillor Scanlan, in proposing the Motion, referred to the benefit of local

knowledge in assisting with decisions around housing issues and the benefits of service

delivery at Municipal level.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

**REPLY:**

At present, some of the housing services are managed at Municipal Office

level. These include housing maintenance works and the management of

private grants including, Housing Aid for Older People, Mobility Aid Grants,

Housing Adaptation Grants and input into Disabled Person Grants for Council-

owned property.

The Newcastle West District Office is also used for pre-tenancy training for

new tenants, collection of keys and meetings with tenants on estate

management issues. Housing application forms are also available from the

Newcastle West Office. However, the current management arrangements

which provide that housing assessments and allocations take place centrally

is considered the most efficient and effective way of managing this part of

the service.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will move at the next Meeting that Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae Luimnigh hire a full-**

**time Irish Language Officer in order to promote and develop an Ghaeilge in Limerick, and**

**to implement policies relating to an Ghaeilge.**

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, in proposing the Motion, highlighted the need to protect the Irish

culture and native Language. He outlined the level of work involved in promoting the

Language and the benefit of having an Irish Officer for Limerick City and County Council in

encouraging people to be associated with the Irish Language

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Crowley.

**REPLY:**

The Notice of Motion, if passed, is subject to an application to the

Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for sanction to fill

what would be considered a newly created post in Limerick City and County

Council. Where sanction is received, the position will be considered as part

of the annual budgetary review process.---
20

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue (to be

referred to Home and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)

**I will move at the next Meeting that an immediate and critical review is carried out of the**

**Tenant Purchase Scheme as long-term tenants of Limerick City and County Council**

**continue to be discriminated against and deemed ineligible to purchase the homes that**

**they have lived in and maintained for many years, and deemed ineligible despite having**

**proof of the means to purchase and maintain the property.**

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Home and Social Development Strategic

Policy Committee.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council support Limerick City and County**

**becoming free from goods and services produced in Israeli settlements illegally**

**established on stolen Palestinian land and therefore urges Senators to support the Control**

**of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, 2018.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó

Ceallaigh.

Councillor O’Hanlon proposed that the Motion be rejected and this was seconded by

Councillor Lynch. Councillor O’Dea proposed that the Motion be withdrawn and this was

seconded by Councillor Donegan.

Following discussion, the two amending Motions were withdrawn and it was agreed

that a Vote would be taken, in the form of a show of hands, on the Motion as set out on the

Agenda, as proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh. As the

majority of the Members were not in favour of the Motion, the Mayor declared the Motion

defeated.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Collins

**I will move at the next Meeting that we, the Councillors of Limerick City and County**

**Council, make asubmission to the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to**

**the Licence Application P0029-06 to allow CRH to begin Industrial Incineration in Limerick.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Collins (J), who outlined the following

Submission, and was seconded by Councillor Hogan:

**“We, the Councillors of Limerick City and County Council, wish to formally object to**

**the Licence Application P0029-06 to allow CRH/ ICL to begin industrial incineration**

**in Limerick on the following grounds.**

**The potential adverse impact on public health of incineration of toxic substances in**

**our community cannot be accurately assessed. The detrimental effects of toxic**---
21

**waste incineration on public health are not, and will not, be measured or**

**monitored. The risk** **to this generation’s health and that of future generations is**

**unknown.**

**We are concerned that the HSE, by its own admission, does not have the expertise**

**to assess the risk of industrial incineration on public health. It does not have the**

**data or the resources to understand or investigate the clusters of cancer and**

**pulmonary ailments that have been described in the vicinity of the plant over**

**many decades, even using existing raw materials and fuels. If there are significant**

**unknown health risks with the existing process, how can we allow that risk to be**

**radically increased by introducing toxins?**

**Irish Cement insist that their intended process for incinerating waste is ‘safe.’ They**

**have repeatedly stated: there are no health risks, even before An Bord Pleanála**

**(ABP) disallowed a significant amount of substances, included in the original**

**application coded list of 117, as hazardous materials. Supporting this position, An**

**Bord Pleanála (ABP) assured the people of Limerick that burning industrial waste**

**‘would notbe prejudicial to public health.’**

**But by what authority can ABP make such an emphatic assurance? How do they**

**know? What process of deduction allows them to give this guarantee? Where is**

**the data supporting such an unfaltering position?**

**‘Safe,’ as defined by incineration companies, refers to the ‘safe’ limits of poisons**

**and pollutants that current regulation allows them to release into the atmosphere.**

**History teaches us that limits are amended over time as new science emerges. And**

**these existing ‘safe’ limits, as determined by operating standards, are established**

**using exemplary science in perfect laboratory conditions. Specific context,**

**operational histories and a corporation’s culture are ignored in establishing such**

**limits. ‘Safety’ is measured by what** **is technically achievable with existing**

**technology. The Cement Plant in Mungret is currently before the courts due to**

**poor environmental performance and fugitive dust emissions. This prosecution**

**was due to public pressure, and publicly funded laboratory tests, not through**

**routine enforcement by the EPA.**

**The recent advent of deeper research into air quality has shown that very small**

**nanoparticles and particulate matter (PM2.5 and lower) can be the most damaging**

**to inhale, and often escapes filtration and monitoring. Research into air quality is**

**entering a new phase, but regulation has yet to catch up. In Ireland, monitoring**

**has yet to catch up.**

**Poor air quality is now related to infertility, mental health, and increasingly is a**

**factor in determining property values. Good air leads to longevity and well-being.**

**Scientists at the cutting edge of this research recognise that much existing**

**regulation is both wrong and out of date. Harm often results from much lower**

**levels of exposure to pollutants than the so-called ‘safe’ levels stipulated by**

**current safety standards.**---
22

**What the Mid-West is faced with in this current standoff between concerned**

**citizens of Limerick versus Irish Cement is a governance gap. In a recent question to**

**the Dáil, Niall Collins T.D. asked*“what action*** ***the HSE will take to measure and***

***manage the increased health risks to the population in the vicinity of the planned***

***incinerator.”*** **A reply was referred by Minister of Health to Dr. Kevin Kelleher,**

**Assistant National Director** **–** **Public Health/Childcare, Strategic Planning and**

**Transformation.**

**Dr. Kelleher’s response, dated 9th** **May, 2018, set down the shortfalls and**

**insufficiencies of the HSE in protecting the public. In several ways, this position was**

**a climb-down from the emphatic confidence of the HSE Environmental Officers**

**who had rubber-stamped Irish Cement’s Environmental Impact Statement back in**

**June 2016. In their submission report, they admitted that** ***‘**no risk assessment for***

***Tolerable Daily Intake of dioxins, furans and dioxin-**like PCBs has been undertaken.’***

**In other words, they have no idea if our daily dose of dioxins will impact our**

**wellbeing?**

**Dr Kelleher continued:** ***“Routine surveillance data is not gathered on acute or***

***chronic disease or risk factors for chronic disease at a local level at a population***

***level.”*** **(in other words, while some of this information is available on individuals**

**patients notes in hospitals and general practices, the information is not collected in**

**a systematic way or collectable at the moment to a central database. Currently,**

**there is no way of combining this data to review it for a population that lives in a**

**particular District Electoral Division or other geographical area.**

**If Dr. Kelleher’s statement demonstrated that there has been no assessment of the**

**health hazard to date, it revealed too that the HSE are not obliged to monitor**

**future risk. He stated:** ***‘There is no environmental or planning legislation which***

***obliges the HSE to assess and undertake the ongoing long-term monitoring of a***

***potential risk to human health from a particular site-specific development***

***following the granting of planning permission.’*** **By their own admission, the HSE**

**only responds to acute enquiries/concerns about health issues in a community as**

**they arise, e.g. dust blows. Currently in Ireland, routine surveillance of disease is**

**limited to that of infectious disease and on a delayed time scale, Cancer and**

**Suicide.**

**So, when Irish Cement, ABP or the HSE assure the people of Limerick that there is**

**nothing ‘prejudicial to public health,’ we must be wary. After all, they are not**

**making this claim on a disease registry or context-specific research: there has been**

**no independent collection of data and no one else knows any better. How can we**

**know the effects on public health if there is no specific baseline data to refer back**

**to?**

**In the US, there is an arm of federal governance called the Agency for Toxic**

**Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). This body seeks to protect communities**

**from harmful health effects related to exposure to natural and man-made**---
23

**hazardous substances. They are a science-based public health agency tasked with**

**four key actions: responding to environmental health emergencies; investigating**

**emerging environmental health threats; conducting research on the health impacts**

**of hazardous waste sites; building capabilities of and providing actionable guidance**

**to state and local health partners.**

**Nothing like this exists in Ireland. This is the governance gap, which is at present**

**being filled by the work of Limerick Against Pollution (LAP), local politicians and**

**the genuine concerns of the hundreds of people who marched through the city on**

**13th May, justifiably concerned that their long-term health and that of their**

**children are under threat.**

**At a time when people are ever-more conscious of the vitality of good air and**

**water to a harmonious life, perhaps it is time that this governance gap was filled.**

**Even without the threat of incineration, the people of Limerick and the ecosystem**

**of the Shannon valley deserve state-of-the-art air monitoring and the collection**

**and collation of data. Only then can we tackle effectively the health crisis of**

**widespread pulmonary disease and asthma, and the national crisis of both non-**

**compliant industries and ineffective government bodies.”**

The Members expressed extreme disappointment with the decision of An Bord

Pleanála to grant planning for replacement of fossil fuels use at Irish Cement’s

manufacturing facilities at Mungret. In particular, the Members expressed disappointment

that the views of the local community, as well as expert witnesses, in relation to the burning

of hazardous waste in a facility, surrounded by housing, was ignored. The Members, in

particular, raised health concerns of local communities and residents.

Following further discussion, the Motion was agreed.

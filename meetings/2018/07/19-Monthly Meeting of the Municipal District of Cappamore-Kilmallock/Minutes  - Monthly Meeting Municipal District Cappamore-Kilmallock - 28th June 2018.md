Statement by Cllr Noel Gleeson

With the agreement of the Cathaoirleach and the Elected Members, Cllr Gleeson indicated

that he wished to make the following statement:

I refer to my comments at the last Municipal District meeting about the Smart CCTV system,

which were reported in the Limerick Leader on the 25th May, 2018. I wish to apologise for

certain comments I made about a solicitor in Newcastlewest, whom the Limerick Leader

subsequently named as Rossa McMahon. I acknowledge that these comments unfairly

characterised his concerns about the CCTV scheme.---
2

I accept that I unfairly suggested that he had an untoward motive, that he stood to profit

from objecting to the scheme, that he was in any way responsible for what I referred to as

“mayhem” or that any clients of his might be people who could or should not be defended.

I may not agree with his views on the CCTV scheme but I absolutely accept that he has

raised genuine concerns. I regret any damage to his reputation that my comments may

have caused.

the identification of projects to be delivered under the CFRAMS programme. Members were

informed that €60 million has been allocated to provide for infrastructure that will prevent

flooding in Limerick City and Environs, Castleconnell, Athea and Rathkeale. This funding will

advance these schemes to the detailed design and construction phases.

The Members welcomed the Flood Risk Management Plans but noted that suggested flood

protection proposals may need to be amended once a detailed design was completed on the

selected areas and thanked the Executive Engineer for his presentation.

Draft Noise Action Plan 2018

The Director of Services, Physical Development briefed the Members on the Draft Noise

Action Plan 2018. The presentation outlined that the Draft Noise Action Plan is a five year

strategic plan to address noise from major roads in Limerick and that the plan excludes noise

from domestic activities. He outlined the effects that road traffic noise has on people’s health

and the measures that can be taken to prevent, reduce and preserve it.

Members were advised that the Plan is currently on public display until the 29th June, 2018

with a final plan to be submitted to the EPA in September 2018 for consideration and review.

The Director of Services, Physical Development also confirmed that the Plan, once adopted,

would feed into the County Development Plan and into the planning permission process when

future planning applications were being considered.

The Members thanked the Director of Services for his presentation but noted the noise issues

generated in areas other than road traffic, which were also a source of major nuisance and

concern for the general public.---

proposed Junction Improvement Scheme at Lynch’s Corner, Caherconlish, Co.Limerick and

disappointment that the proposed works going to tender were different to what had been

in the original Part 8 Planning application that had been previously approved by the

Municipal District Members.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Design and Delivery Services explained that the proposed

works had been amended due to budgetary constraints for the project and emphasised the

importance of proceeding with the project to avoid the possibility of losing the funding for

the junction improvement works currently being proposed.

the community in Caherconlish in the original Part 8 proposals and stressed the importance---

QUESTIONS

6.

Question submitted by Councillor B. O’Donnell

**I will ask at the next Meeting when will a permanent street cleaner operative be appointed**

**to Bruff Town by Limerick City and County Council.**

**REPLY:**

The Operations South Division, based at Kilmallock Area Office has assigned

one general operative to carry out street cleaning duties in Bruff and Croom.

At present, the general operative divides his time equally between both

locations.

The Kilmallock Area Office are monitoring the street cleaning requirements in

Bruff, in particular at weekends where a number of litterbins are full. The

Council will assign additional resources on a trial basis to empty street bins at

the weekend. The trial period will start in July 2018 and be reviewed at the end

of August 2018.

The Elected Members expressed disappointment at the fact that the full-time general

operative who had been based in Bruff and who had recently retired, was not being---
5

replaced by a full time person. They were concerned at the impact this would have on the

work being done by voluntary groups in Bruff and the dangerous precedent being

created which may have implications for service delivery in other areas of the District as well.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer, Cappamore-Kilmallock agreed that it was regrettable but

that it was a resources issue and that the situation would be monitored over the next couple

of months to assess how the revised procedures were operating.

The Members stressed the importance of the local authority providing adequate support to

all voluntary groups in the District who were making huge efforts to maintain and improve

their communities.

ongoing. The repairs will be complete by 6th July, 2018.

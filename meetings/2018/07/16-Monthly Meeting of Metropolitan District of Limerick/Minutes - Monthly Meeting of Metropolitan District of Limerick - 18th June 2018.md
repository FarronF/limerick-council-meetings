***Ballykeeffe and originally intended for development as a neighbourhood park.***

**REPLY**:

The Council has been advised by legal representatives acting for the owner of the

lands in question that the lands have been sold and are therefore no longer

available to the Council.

The zoning on the land is Open Space and Recreation.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on plans to create a safe walkway for access to***

***Gaelscoil Chaladh an Treoigh, and when it is envisaged to have a safe access route in place.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council has prepared a preliminary design for proposed

future works on the R445 in Castletroy. These works may involve the provision of

a roundabout, part of which will need to be on private lands. For the various

options, lands are in the ownership of different landowners, and the Council is

currently working with these landowners in relation to the overall development of

the road, and the adjoining lands. The Council are hoping that this work can be

concluded over the next few months and an overall road improvement scheme for

the area finalised.

Limerick City and County Council and the National Transport Authority are

commencing the Limerick Transport Strategy this Summer and as the R445 is a

major access route to the City Centre, this study will also examine the R445 in its
---

entirety and determine the appropriate transport measures to be applied on this

strategic transport corridor. Once this study and discussions on the proposed

scheme with affected stakeholders is finalised, the scheme will be brought to Part

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on plans to significantly improve the junction of the***

***N24 and R513, more commonly known as Beary's Cross, and when it is envisaged such works***

***will begin and be completed.***

**REPLY**:

Funding has recently been made available by the TII to proceed with the necessary

Site Investigation and Topographic survey contract. This contract is expected on

site within the next two months as the tendering process is well advanced. Once

the results of the investigation are analysed, the maps relevant to a Compulsory

Purchase Order will be prepared.

This will enable the Council to engage with the relevant landowners in particular

(and with the wider public generally) through the statutory procedures associated

with the CPO process. This formal engagement is scheduled to begin at the latter

end of 2018. If a year is allowed for the necessary engagement, Bord Pleanála

construction work may be expected to begin in early 2020. This is always subject

to TII approvals and funding being available.

**REPLY**:

The Thomond Weir is currently being used under licence on a temporary basis, to

facilitate the restoration of a barge. The existing building on the site has been

cleared back to a ‘shell and core’ state. It is envisaged, given its sound structural

condition, that this building will be retained for appropriate re-use. Minor works

the site earlier in the year. There is development potential for the remainder of

the site in conjunction with other lands in this area owned by Limerick City and

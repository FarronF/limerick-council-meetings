**Housing Development Directorate**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Seamus Hanrahan, Senior Architect & Ms. Aoife Duke,

Director of Service, Social Development Directorate to the Meeting.

The Senior Architect gave an updated presentation to Members on Limerick City and

County Council’s Housing Delivery Programme. Following a discussion in relation to

maintaining the Councils existing vacant houses, Councillor Keary requested a motion be

put to the next Full Council Meeting to discuss the huge budget for buying one off

houses and to request funds be reappropriated to bring long term voids back into stock.

On the proposal of Councillor Teskey and seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue it was

agreed a letter should be sent to the Minister of DHPLG to respond to the request for

more funding.

The Director explained to Members that 50% of income received on housing rents goes

back into maintenance of these properties. Costings and submissions have been made

to the Department to address the voids issue and Limerick City and County Council is

currently awaiting a response on this matter.

Councillor O’Donoghue expressed his concern in relation to the amount of new builds on

the current Housing Delivery Programme. Councillor O’Donoghue suggested a different

approach be taken for the County due to restrictions on new builds. He also suggested

there should be less restrictions on listed buildings. On the proposal of Councillor
---
O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Sheahan it was proposed a letter be sent to Tom

Cassidy asking that a more pragmatic approach be adopted with the owners of listed

buildings which would include a relaxation of restrictions that are not iconic to the area

in order to allow people to renovate same.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Keary it was agreed Tom

Cassidy be invited to the September Monthly Meeting to discuss delisting of properties.

Following this discussion The Senior Architect then proceeded to give an updated

presentation on the Adare Public Land Activation Programme. He informed Members

that a preferred developer had been notified and it is hoped to have a planning

application submitted by the end of 2018 for this project. Members again expressed

their concern about the number (5 no.) of proposed serviced sites. Councillor Sheahan

told the meeting he would find it difficult to agree to the proposed sale of land at Adare

when Councillors requests were not been entertained for additional serviced sites. On

the proposal of Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor Keary it was agreed Members

would take a 5 – 10 minute adjournment to have a discussion on the matter.

After 10 minutes Councillor Teskey officially reopened the meeting and read out the

following statement;

“We as a group of 4 Councillors require that the proposed social housing development in

Adare will incorporate 30 number of semi detached houses and 10 fully serviced

affordable sites”.

Following this statement by Members The Director, National and Regional Shared

Services Centre informed Members the programme would now have to go back to

procurement and this could delay the whole programme by approx. 12 – 18 months.

Councillor Keary expressed disappointment at progress on the whole matter to date

saying this would delay progress and impact on the public sewer construction.

The Cathaoirleach thanked the Senior Architect for his presentation.

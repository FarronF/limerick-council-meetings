**QUESTIONS**

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council streamline and simplify the***

***burdening administrative process that residents looking for parking permits must endure and***

***provide an online option.***

**REPLY**:

The Council endeavours to ensure that only those who demonstrate an eligibility

for a residential parking permit receive one.

The process involved therefore in complying with the requirements may

sometimes be perceived as a little cumbersome. The on-street parking stock

is crucial and critical to the economic wellbeing of the city, and vital to protect the

quality of life for people both in the city and suburbs**.**  It is necessary to manage

the residential parking permits system so as to ensure that this continues.

The application process for the residential parking permits will be kept under

review and plans are advancing for a simplification by offering an online 'renewal'

service. It is hoped to introduce this in 2019.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan Council provide an update as to when***

***Fáilte Ireland will, as previously requested, attend a Meeting of the Council to discuss the***

***regional imbalance in festival grant allocations.***

**REPLY**:

A meeting took place in April 2018 between a number of Departments within

Limerick City and County Council and Failte Ireland. At the meeting, Failte Ireland

outlined their new strategic approach to investment in Festival and Events at local

and national level.

**Festivals and Events**

Failte Ireland have undertaken a review of their support for festivals and events.

There are now new teams in the following areas under product development;

• Attractions - (large grant schemes, small grant schemes)

• Festivals - (regional/national and a new scheme under innovation)

• Activities - (water, walking, cycling)

The priorities under Festivals and Events for Failte Ireland will be;

 Festivals and Events that are of international standing that bring international

visitors to Ireland, doubling the tourism numbers to 200 million

 Seasonality - this can mean different things to different places but essentially

off season

 Regionality - where occupancy is not currently considered to be high

 Unique Events that have their roots in Ireland and whose authenticity cannot

be replicated anywhere else

 Investment in festival development around sales, sponsorship and

merchandising

Failte Ireland wish to do fewer, bigger, better festivals and will create a larger fund

to replace the regional and national fund with a fund for innovation or new

festivals (criteria to yet to be determined).

**Diaspora and Tourism Fund**

Limerick and Donegal have been identified for investment in the Global Irish pilot

initiative with local authorities. Failte Ireland will set up a working group that will

include representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Failte Ireland and

Limerick City and County Council for the purposes of this monitoring and

developing the project. The aim of this pilot scheme is the activating of the British

and North American Markets initially. This project will be managed by the LCCC

Tourism Development Department.

**Riverfest**

It was agreed that the International marketing team in Failte Ireland would support

the international marketing of Riverfest in 2018 as well as Tourism Ireland. Laura

Patrick's Week in Ireland'. Failte Ireland have invited Limerick through the Culture

and Arts Department to the table in relation to discussions around this. There will

be cross department cooperation on this project.

Furthermore, a letter will issue from Tourism Development to invite them to the

Metropolitan Meeting of 17th September 2018.

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting how many horses were seized by Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae***

***Luimnigh in the Metropolitan District so far in 2018, how many horses were reclaimed, how***

***many horses were rehomed, how many were put down, how many cases were taken against***

***people for the illegal ownership and/or the mistreatment of horses, how much has horse control***

***cost Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae Luimnigh so far this year and how much of this was***

***subsidised by the Department of Agriculture.***

**REPLY:**

**The following figures are for the period 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2018:**

Equine seized in Metropolitan area:

**118**

Reclaimed by owner

**4**

Re-Homed:

**7**

Disposed of by Euthanasia as per bye-laws: **100**

Euthanized on Welfare Grounds

**7**

It is a legal requirement that horses be micro-chipped that the owners have a valid

horse passport issued by one of the approved passport-issuing bodies. Of the 118

horses seized, 13 were micro-chipped. It is therefore not possible to identify the

owners of the majority of horses.

However, the responsibility for enforcement of these requirements lies with the

Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine rather than the Council. Similarly,

Limerick City and County Council does not have power to prosecute horse owners

for the mistreatment of horses. The powers to do this under the relevant Animal

Health and Welfare legislation lie with the Department of Agriculture Food and the

Marine, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and An Garda

Síochána.

The total expense to Limerick City and County Council for all horse seizures in all

districts to 30 June 2018 was **€91,516.24.**

The partial recoupment of fees from the Department of Agriculture Food and the

Marine for that period is projected to be **€46,025.00.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. S.** **Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next meeting how many people are on Limerick's housing list for the***

***Metropolitan District, how many are on the HAP scheme in the Metropolitan District, how many***

***are on the RAS scheme in the Metropolitan District, and how many local authority owned homes***

***will be built or renovated and re-let by the end of 2019.***

QUESTIONS
5. Question submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

| will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City & County Council has a policy for replacing

unsightly signs at graveyards in its administrative area.

REPLY: Limerick City and County Council is currently preparing a policy on the
provision of signage at graveyards and this would include the removal of
existing signs. The format of the new signs has not been decided at this time
but will be bi-lingual and contain a number of key byelaws. Unsightly signs
from a small number of graveyards will be removed in August 2018 and

replacement signs erected.

The Members agreed that only a summary of the most important rules should be on
graveyard signage so that signage is short but effective. It was also agreed that byelaws should

be enforced at all times to ensure full compliance with the rules.

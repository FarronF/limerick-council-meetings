The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Senior Executive Officer, Physical Development Directorate,

to ensure that waste is properly disposed of, thereby reducing instances of illegal dumping of

household waste and to enable enforcement officers to seek clarification from householders

as to how they are disposing of their household waste.

He stated that currently 65% of households in Limerick City and County participate in a

contracted private kerbside waste collection service and there are 25,000 households in

Limerick City and County that have no kerbside waste collection service. He also mentioned

that these households may comply with their obligations by participating in a bin-sharing

arrangement or by disposing of their waste at an authorised facility. He stated that the Draft

Bye-Laws aim to reduce contamination in recycling waste by ensuring that waste fractions are

properly segregated.

The Senior Executive Officer informed the Meeting that the statutory bye-law making process

requires that the Council undertake a public consultation process prior to the adoption of the

waste presentation bye-laws and that the approval of the draft bye-laws for publication is a

reserved function of the Metropolitan and Municipal Districts.

***I will move at the next Meeting that an audit be undertaken on the serious matter***

***of illegal dumping in the Glenagowen, Rooska and Keele areas to West and North West of***

***Newcastle West Town.***

locations.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Browne who also asked that Tournafulla be

included in this audit.

areas. Members supported the Motion and it was suggested that mobile cctv cameras should

be considered for each District and a proposal on same should form part of the Budget

process. In response, the Director stated that the matter of illegal dumping is a nationwide

problem and he would follow up on the cctv proposal.

The Environmental Control Officers have visited and reported on nine sites

where either historic or recent illegal dumping has occurred. Proposals for

removing the waste in each case are being examined at present and this may

involve, in some instances, the co-operation of the relevant landowners.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan asked when a suitable site for a new Graveyard

in Abbeyfeale would be identified and purchased.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

At present the site selection process for a new burial ground for Abbeyfeale is

continuing and expressions of interest have been sought from local

landowners as part of this. As potential sites are still being sought and

evaluated and as this is an executive function it would not be appropriate to

comment on individual sites.

The Director stated that the Council is continuing to seek expressions of interest from

landowners in the Abbeyfeale area who may have a site that could be considered and he also

referred to the work to date on seeking a suitable site.

The following items were also raised.

Cllr. Scanlan referred to changing dates for Meetings. He stated these changes can cause

problems for Members and stated if Meeting dates are to be changed then all Members

should be in agreement with the new date.

The Senior Executive Engineer referred to Brewery Lane Newcastle West and confirmed that

he has met with the stakeholders of the lane with a view to having the laneway reopened. He

stated that discussion on the upgrade of the lane is also ongoing.

With regard to traffic flow at Boherbui, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the

pedestrian crossings at this location would involve the removal of car parking spaces and

therefore the possibility of a drop off location for students on Knockane Road is being

investigated. He also mentioned that the brief for the Newcastle West Integrated Movement

Plan is being finalised and this will also take traffic flow on the Boherbui area into

consideration. It is expected that the brief will be tendered within the coming weeks. It was

also noted that a site known as Cullen’s field is currently up for sale and maybe relevant to

the Integrated Movement Plan. The Director stated that the proposed plan was not a

statutory plan but the Members would be consulted on it.

The Executive Engineer stated that the process outlined under the Limerick City and County

Council Traffic Calming Policy had commenced with regard to the request for speed

ramps/rumble strips on the road at Gortboy outside the Courtenay National School.

The repair and relocating of litterbins in Mouncollins Village was also raised along with the

repairs to the road at Gleann Cryle, Abbeyfeale and the Executive Engineer agreed to follow

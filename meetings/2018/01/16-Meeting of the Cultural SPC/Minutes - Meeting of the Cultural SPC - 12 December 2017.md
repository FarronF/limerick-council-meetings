work of the Committee completed.

**Item 7.**

**Consideration of Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

*I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City & County Council host a*

*family-friendly, public bonfire night to alleviate pressure on Gardaí and the*

*Fire Services and to curb illegal burning of rubbish and the damaging of green*

*areas.*

Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh advised that this proposal had originally been brought to the

Metropolitan meeting but was referred to the JPC . He stated that a similar initiative had

been successful in Cork. Members were supportive of the idea in principle and suggested it

might also be considered for areas outside of the City. It was noted that there were two

different dates i.e. May Eve for the City and Halloween in the towns. The following written

response had been provided to the members from the Director:

**Response after speaking with Cork City Council in relation to** **St. John’s Eve**

The Cork City Summer Fun Nights have been running since 2007 aim to provide an

alternative, family friendly events to celebrate bonfire night (23rd June) or St. John’s Eve.

The events were established in 2007 by local communities, in partnership with Cork City

Council and other statutory agencies in response to what had become a difficult night for

these communities; a night synonymous with litter and dumping, illegal fires and serious

anti-social behaviour and drinking.

Over 10 years the events have had a significant impact on reducing anti-social behaviours,

environmental damage and the number of illegal fires in these communities. However, it

does not fully eradicate the anti social behaviour associated with the lighting of bonfires.

There are five events in five parks across Cork City. Each event is based in a public park in

one of the RAPID areas in the City and is coordinated by the RAPID Coordinators in the Cork

City Regeneration Offices.

The events in the park attract approx. 10,000 members of the public on an annual basis.

This year over 12,000 members of the public attended the events in the park.

The investment by Cork City Council is in the order of €43,000

If Limerick were deliver a similar type of event we would need to investigate further the

possibilities around locations, partners, funding and health and safety.

Ar moladh Cllr M. Collins;

Cuidithe ag Cllr. J. Leddin, agus glacadh leis:

“That a proposal be worked up to be brought before the SPC Members at its March

Meeting”

**Item 8.**

**Any Other Business**

There was no other business discussed.

The meeting then concluded.

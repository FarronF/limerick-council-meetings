Proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Hospital Local Area Plan 2012-2018 (as extended)

were zoned Residential Serviced Sites.

2.

Deputation

The Cathaoirleach welcomed a Deputation to the Meeting from Hospital Community

Council comprising Messrs. Tony Hehir, Eddie Creighton and Cannon Conor Ryan.

The Deputation addressed the Meeting and raised issues under the following headings:

•

Speed of traffic through the town.

•

Housing.

•

Delisting of buildings.

In relation to the speed of traffic, it was requested that table ramps be provided at

both ends and the centre of town in order to assist with the reduction of speed. Reference

was made to the number of primary and post-primary students in the town which was in

excess of 1,400 and the level of traffic involved in dropping and collecting pupils from

school. It was also stated that the R513 was a very busy route as it connected East Cork to

Limerick and the West of Ireland.

The proposed development of 20 houses was welcomed by the majority of

people but concern had been raised initially in relation to the proposed entrance and exit to

the development. It was stated that the proposed new road layout design had allayed

people’s concerns. Members of the Deputation asked, for safety reasons, if the entrance to

the playground could be moved to the car park area. They also referred to allocation of

houses in the new development and possible installation of CCTV cameras.---

In conclusion, the Deputation referred to the high number of listed properties in

Hospital. The current number listed was 60. They raised concerns in relation to cost of

upgrading these properties and also the difficulty experienced by owners in trying to sell

them.

Members commended the group on their presentation and acknowledged the

achievements of the Community Council.

In relation to amendment of Hospital Local Area Plan, Councillor Donegan stated

that he had received no other representation other than from the community and business

of Hospital as referred to in the Chief Executive’s Report dated 24th November, 2017, under

Item No. 3 on the agenda.

On the proposal of Councillor Ryan, seconded by Councillor Sheehy, it was agreed to

allocate €10,000 to Ballylanders Community Centre to assist with the purchase of a bus. It

was agreed that a letter would be sent to Ballylanders Community Centre advising that

€10,000 had been allocated to them from the General Municipal Allocation.

QUESTION

4.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Ryan

**I will ask at the next meeting (a) why Limerick City and County Council did not apply for**

**funding to carry out works under the Local Improvement Scheme; (b) how many are on**

**the waiting list for the Scheme in Limerick; and (c) how many are on the waiting list for**

**the Scheme in the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council maintains a list of Local Improvement

Schemes in the order in which they are received. Members are aware that it

is a requirement that the landowners are required to contribute 10% of the

cost of the scheme.

(a) and (b) In September this year, and in response to a Circular Letter from

the Department of Community and Rural Affairs, the Council submitted a list

of 53 schemes for consideration and approval by the Department. 14

schemes were approved and the works were carried out during October and

November. This meant that 39 schemes did not receive approval at this

stage.

On 26th November, a new Circular was issued from the Department inviting

the submission of further schemes. Due to a misunderstanding, it was the

Council’s impression that the schemes that had been previously submitted in

September would be considered by the Department in this welcome second

round of funding for 2017. When it was clarified that it was necessary to re-

submit the original list, the Council did so immediately and is awaiting

clarification from the Department.---

(c) 6 on waiting list for Scheme in the Municipal District of Cappamore-

Kilmallock.

Since September, a further 8 additional schemes have been submitted to the

Council for inclusion under the Local Improvements Scheme. These are

currently being costed and, of these 8, two are located in the Municipal

District of Cappamore-Kilmallock.

The Director advised the Meeting that additional funding in the sum of €134,000 had

been approved by the Department of Rural and Community Development in respect of

additional Local Improvement Scheme road projects.

**Other Matters Raised**

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the following matters were raised:

• The Members raised their concerns that the main roads were the only roads salted

during severe weather conditions and queried if local roads, especially where there were

schools, could be considered for salting. The A/Senior Executive Engineer agreed with

the Members that roads with schools should get priority but unfortunately, due to

Health & Safety and the Working Time Act, he did not have the manpower to deal with

other roads outside of the National Roads.

•

A presentation was made to Ms. Tina Knox on her departure from Corporate Services.

The Members expressed their gratitude for all work she had carried out since taking up

the position of Meetings Administrator for the Municipal District. They stated that she

was very approachable, friendly and helpful and they wished her well in her new role

with Property Services.

This concluded the Meeting.

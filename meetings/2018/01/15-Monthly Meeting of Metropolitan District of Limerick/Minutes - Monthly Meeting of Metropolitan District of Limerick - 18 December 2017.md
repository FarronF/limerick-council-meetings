**6.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the current status of any plans to address the***

***general maintenance issues raised by the residents of Meagher Close (Hyde Road, Prospect).***

**REPLY**:

In the context of a new budget year, it is proposed that staff from Operations &

Maintenance and from Estate Management would undertake a joint inspection of

Meagher Close in January with a view to identifying what improvement measures

may be undertaken and how these might be funded.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on Air Quality monitoring within the Metropolitan***

***area.***

**REPLY**:

The three air quality monitors which are located in Castletroy, O’Connell Street

and Mungret went live on 10th May 2017, and have been providing real time

particulate data to the public at http://www.airqweb.com since then.

The monitors have been working continuously apart from two interruptions due

to technical faults. The O'Connell Street monitor was offline from 25th May until

12th June due to a cable fault. The Mungret monitor was offline from 28th Nov.

to 13th Dec. due to a blown transformer.---

The results from the monitors show the air quality in the three locations to be

very good. All 24hour averages and long term averages are well within the World

Health Organisation guidelines and the limits contained in the Clean Air for

Europe Directive.

The long term averages (May to Dec 2017) for each of the monitoring locations is

shown in the table below and compared with the guideline and limit values for

annual mean.

Beginning in early 2018, it is intended to publish monthly reports summarising

the results from each of the monitors.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the abandoned Dunnes in Sarsfield Street and the Horizon Mall***

***Site have been inspected for addition to the list of derelict sites, and if so what was the result***

***of the inspections.***

**Reply**:

The former Dunnes Stores site on Sarsfield Street has not recently been inspected

under Derelict Sites Act, 1990.

A notice under Section 11 of the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 was served on the Horizon

Mall site on 21st September, 2017. A six month period has been granted to comply

with the terms of this notice. The site is not entered on the Council’s Derelict Sites

Register to date.

**12.**

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***how many Council houses, purpose built for elderly people, are***

***due to be constructed in the Metropolitan District next year.***

**Reply**:

A number of purpose-built housing schemes for the elderly have been completed

over the last number of years. These include:

Vizes Court Phase 1 (16 units);

Cliona Park Elderly Apartments (21 units);

Southill Older Person Accommodation (35 units); and

Vizes Court Phase 2 (29 units).

The mixed-use development at Lord Edward Street is nearing completion and has

been allocated. This development includes 57 elderly units including specialist

universal access units. The next elderly housing scheme scheduled to be

progressed is the Orchard Site, King’s Island, Limerick, which is a 26 unit scheme.

Other developments, while not specifically categorised as elderly housing, such

as the Kilmurry Court development in Garryowen will be attractive to elderly

residents as well as potential downsizers. Kilmurry Court is primarily a single

storey development centred on a courtyard space in the heart of an existing

community. A number of Developers have opted, in consultation with Limerick

City and County Council, to meet their Part V obligations with the provision of

community dwellings and elderly accommodation.---

**13.**

**Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how regularly are Council properties inspected to ensure they***

***meet minimum standards.***

**Reply**:

Inspections take place in the Council’s Housing Stock on a daily basis via our

Foremen, our Tradesmen or appointed Contractors. Staff may have specific tasks

when entering a Council Property, however they have a duty of care to the Tenant

and if an item of non compliance is identified, they will report this to the Foreman

or Technical Staff.

Further to the presentation at the Housing SPC Meeting held on December 11th

2017, it was outlined that a Conditional Survey of all Limerick City & County

Council Housing Stock is planned to be completed in 2018. This survey will

include the minimum housing standards and highlight those elements of stock

which require improvement. The survey will take the opportunity to look at every

aspect of the house and cost the works required to ensure we are providing our

Tenants with a sustainable home for the next 40 years.

The Conditional Survey will be key to supporting Limerick City & County Council

maintain Minimum Standards into the future and ensure that further changes to

the standards can be addressed in a timely manner.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Lynch**

***I will move at the next meeting that this District supports the establishment of an Annual***

***National ‘Make Way Day’ and will write to the Government calling on them to support,***

***establish, fund and resource an Annual National ‘Make Way Day’ which would be localised in***

***each region and that this District will annually support and promote a local ‘Make Way***

***Limerick’ campaign as part of the wider ‘Make Way Day’.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Lynch and seconded by Councillor Collins.

In proposing the motion Councillor Lynch highlighted how practices such as parking cars on

footpaths, bicycles / bins / sandwich boards left on footpaths and overgrown hedges can impact

on those with disabilities or the elderly in negotiating these obstructions.

Members supported the motion and called on the Council, businesses and the public to increase

their awareness of this issue and for any infrastructure works in the District to take this issue

into consideration.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be referred to the Home**

**and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I move at the next Meeting that, given the scale of the housing crisis in the City, the***

***Metropolitan District call for a halt to the sell off of Council owned lands suitable for housing,***---
8

***and instead for these lands to be used for public housing, including a mix of social rental and***

***affordable mortgages.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Home and Social Development Strategic

Policy Committee.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville**

***I move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District requests the Mayor of Limerick City***

***and County to organise a special meeting in January of the Full Council to discuss the new***

***planning application for the development of the Opera Centre, including prospects for***

***including social and affordable apartments in the development.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville outlined the process involved to date with regard

to the Opera Site and noted that, as the Part VIII process would not now go ahead, the

Members would not be afforded the opportunity to consider the submissions that had been

made in relation to same and that this could be included in the meeting of the Full Council

proposed under the motion.

Members supporting the motion made the following points during discussion of the motion:

• Given the scale of expenditure involved, Members should ensure that they agreed with the

details of this project.

• Many workers seek to live close to their workplace and the provision of good quality

residential units as part of the development should be considered.

• The provision of residential units as part of the development should bring increased footfall

and activity to the city, outside of working hours.

Members opposing the motion made the following points during discussion of same:

• Members have been kept well informed of proposals regarding the site and submissions can

be made as part of the planning application process by anyone wishing to do so.

• The proposed development of the Opera Site will bring much needed jobs to Limerick by

providing the type of office accommodation sought by companies.

• While acknowledging the housing crisis in terms of social, private and student

accommodation there are sites available elsewhere, suitable for the provision of social and

private accommodation.

• A high quality commercial centre is required to attract business to the city and ample space

for residential accommodation is available on foot of the merger of the two Limerick

Authorities.

The Meetings Administrator noted the procedure under Standing Orders for calling a meeting of

the Full Council. He pointed out that the Chief Executive, on foot of legal advice, determined

that an EIA should be prepared in association with the proposed development and as a result a

planning application for the development would have to be submitted to An Bord Pleanala. He

noted the Chief Executive’s commitment to brief the Members, prior to submission of the

planning application, which would take into consideration any submissions already made.---

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Keller**

***I will move at the next Meeting that we request a report from the Council Officials on the***

***progress in getting the long-promised community centre for Garryowen.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller acknowledged the efforts of the Council in supporting

the community in Garryowen but stressed that existing community facilities were inadequate for

the range of services they were seeking to support, with services occasionally having to locate

elsewhere.

**Reply**:

Limerick City and County Council is aware of the issues in relation to Community

Centre Provision for the Garryowen Area and have looked at a number of possible

locations in recent years for said proposed centre. Officials have worked closely

with, and support (via Social Intervention Fund, SICAP Funds) Garryowen

Community Development Project who are, along with elected representatives

advocating for a community facility. Locations considered include the Markets

Field and the former Brannigans Pub but without success to date. The issue of

funding will also need to be explored if the project is to proceed once a suitable

site is agreed. A more detailed report can be made available to the Members at a

later date if necessary.

Members supported the motion and stressed the extent of the area in need of community

facilities covered by Garryowen and its surrounding areas and discussed a range of locations,

including greenfield sites, that should be considered in this regard.

Members noted the lack of community facilities elsewhere in the District and called for the

development of a co-ordinated strategy for the provision of community facilities in the District

that would identify need, funding requirements and funding sources.

Members discussed the most appropriate vehicle to progress this proposal and noted that the

LCDC and Home and Social Development SPC had potential in this regard.

The Meetings Administrator acknowledged the work carried out by both Committees and

undertook to bring the proposal to the Director of Home and Social Development with a view

towards a strategy for the development of community facilities being brought via the SPC to the

Full Council.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on Limerick City and County Council to***

***remove the parking fee for park and charge slots around the city in line with nearly 90% of***

***other Councils nationwide supporting environmentally friendly transport.***

It was agreed that this Notice of Motion be referred to the Travel and Transportation Strategic

Policy Committee.---
10

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Hogan**

***I will move at the next Meeting that, following my Motion at the Council Meeting twelve***

***months ago, the Council provide an update on what dialogue is ongoing to ensure that Pope***

***Francis will include Limerick as part of the itinerary of his visit to Ireland in 2018.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hogan and seconded by Councillor Lynch.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hogan noted the previous visit of the Pope 39 years ago and

the strong connection the Jesuit Order had with Pope Francis through Fr. Seamus Enright.

The Meetings Administrator outlined details of contact that had taken place with the Office of

the Papal Nuncio and noted that, while no formal decision had been received in response, a

further communication would be sent.

**20.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Mayor wished all present a safe, peaceful and happy

Christmas.

This concluded the Meeting.

received proposing changes and that these were assessed in line the guidelines set out in

noted that Workshops had been held with the Members in each Municipal District and

issues raised were reviewed either by the Council Executive or Transport Infrastructure

Ireland, as appropriate. The Members approval was now being sought to proceed with the

Review of Newcastle West Pool Feasibility Study

To consider report on Pool Feasibility Impact Study

The Director of Services summarised the findings of the recent Pool Feasibility Impact Study

and that it had concluded that there would be an impact on existing public and private

facilities and that the impact would be significant. He advised that he had met with the local

committee who wished to progress the development of a public pool within Newcastle

West and he acknowledged that they did not agree with all of the findings of the BDO

report. However he was of the view that the concerns raised did not materially alter the

conclusion that a new pool would have a significant impact on existing facilities. Having

considered the BDO report and conscious of local authority requirements for the appraisal

of capital projects, the Director stated that the advice of management to elected members

on this matter is therefore not to proceed with a local authority funded pool at this time.

Some of the members expressed their disappointment with the outcome of the recent

report and discussion took place on the need for a public pool for Newcastle West. The

possibility of holding a further meeting on the matter with local TDs was also raised.

**REPLY:**

The existing burial ground in Tournafulla has according to our previous caretaker 40

unpurchased burial plots left which is ample capacity at present demands to cater for the

next five or more years. In 2013 lands were tested adjacent to the existing burial ground to

assess its suitability as a proposed new burial ground. The site suitability assessment failed

due to extreme groundwater vulnerability and shallow bedrock. The two parcels of ground

available at present are both adjacent to the previous lands tested. In conclusion and

considering the above Limerick City & County Council have no plans at present to pursue the

provision of a new graveyard in Tournafulla.

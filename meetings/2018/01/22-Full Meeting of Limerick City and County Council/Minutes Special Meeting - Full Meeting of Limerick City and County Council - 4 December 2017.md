The Mayor stated that the Special Meeting was being held to discuss the Issues Paper for

the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy for the Southern Region and welcomed Mr.

Brian Thompson from the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy

Committee.

At the outset, a presentation was given by the A/Senior Planner in relation to the Issues

Paper. She pointed out that the Issues Paper had been published on 20th November, 2017,

and the views of the general public were being sought on what should be included in the

Strategy. The purpose of the Strategy was to support the implementation of the National

Planning Framework which was still a draft document. The Regional Spatial and Economic

Strategy was an important document as it would influence and guide the preparation of the

Limerick City and County Development Plan and Local Area Plans over the 12 year period to

2040. She pointed out that any submissions on the Issues Paper had to be submitted by 26th

January, 2018. At that stage, the draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy would be---
2

prepared and would be put out to public consultation. It was anticipated that the Strategy

would be completed by December 2018. The Strategy in this case was being prepared on

behalf of the Southern Region. The Strategy would include policies on:

• Co-ordination and alignment of population and jobs growth.

• Preparation of Metropolitan Area Strategic Plans (MASPs) for the Cork, Limerick and

Waterford Metropolitan areas.

• Identification and quantification of locations for strategic employment growth.

• Identification of a number of large regionally distributed towns where future population

and jobs growth would be focused.

• Ensuring that the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy would provide for, and guide,

targeted population growth of Ireland’s smaller towns and rural areas at an average rate

of 15% across the region.

• Identification and prioritisation of key future growth enablers

She pointed out that while the National Planning Framework had not yet been finalised, the

Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy was being developed in accordance with the

population targets which were included in the draft Framework. Potential estimated

population targets for the period 2016-2040 for the Southern Region were presented as

follows:

**Population Targets 2016-2040 – Southern Region**

**Population Allocation for Southern Region**

**375,000 (maximum growth figure)**

3 Cities

(Cork 115,000)

(Limerick 52,000)

(Waterford 29,000)

196,000

(allocated growth figures)

Large Towns

56,718

Remaining population for small towns below

10,000 and rural areas

122,282

Distributed between 9 Counties in Southern

Region (proportions to be decided by

Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy)

13,222

(assumes even distribution between 9

Counties)

Average growth in population per year over

24 year period

551 people

At an occupancy rate of 2.5 as proposed in

National Planning Framework

220 houses per year for small towns below

10,000 and rural areas.

The A/Senior Planner then gave a number of examples of the potential impact of the

proposals in relation to the area of Limerick City and County Council and on the Mid-West

Region. She expressed her concerns in relation to the proposals being brought forward and

outlined a number of issues for consideration by the Members in relation to a possible

submission on their behalf on this matter, as follows:---
3

**Population Allocation:**

• Recognition that towns below the 10,000 population threshold could act as important

economic and service drivers within their Municipal Districts – abandon the 10,000

population threshold.

• Headroom of up to 150% should be allowed when zoning.

**Other Issues**

• Key Growth Enablers.

• Metropolitan Strategic Area Plans.

• The Draft National Planning Framework recognised Cork as an **Emerging International**

**Centre of Scale** and Limerick as **Important National and Regional Driver of Growth** –

Limerick needed the same recognition as Cork if there was potential for balanced

regional growth.

• Policy support for the Limerick to Cork Motorway (M20).

• Policy support for the Limerick Northern Distributor Road.

• Policy support for the Foynes to Limerick Route, including rail.

• Shannon Airport recognised as a Strategic International Airport.

• Promote the potential for public transport connectivity with Shannon Airport.

• Improved interconnectivity between Regional Cities – not only by road, high speed rail

interconnectivity needed to be put in place.

• Strengthen further the policy support for Shannon/Foynes Port.

• Significant upfront investment in public transport – develop an integrated City public

transport scheme.

• Recognise the importance of tourism areas to the local economy.

• Promote the development of core urban areas.

• Recognise the potential for development of the Shannon Estuary in line with the

Strategic Integrated Framework Plan.

• Investment in Digital Networks.

The Members thanked the A/Senior Planner for the informative presentation and the

overview of the implications for both Limerick and the Mid-West Region if the proposals, as

outlined, were put in place. Councillors Sheahan (J) and Gleeson pointed out that they,

together with Councillor Leddin, were members of the Southern Regional Assembly and

they had expressed strong opposition to the proposals being brought forward, which they

considered anti-Limerick, anti-Mid-West and anti-rural. Councillor Sheahan (J) proposed that

a cross-party delegation from the Council travel to Dublin to meet the appropriate Minister

and officials who had responsibility for the preparation of the National Planning Framework

to voice their strong opposition to the proposals being brought forward. He added that the

3 representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly would also be voicing their opposition

to proposals put forward at the forthcoming Southern Regional Assembly meeting.---

There was unanimous support across the Chamber to this proposal, with Members from all

parties voicing opposition to the contents of the Issues Paper. Items of concern included

the following:

• No population caps should be put in place and recognition needed to be given to the

fact that Limerick was growing and there had been significant economic development in

the last number of years which hopefully would continue into the future.

• By putting caps on population growth and setting limits on the development of smaller

towns, this would curtail the development of these towns and surrounding rural areas.

• This also had important implications in relation to water and wastewater infrastructure

in these towns as Irish Water would not provide funding for such infrastructure if not

included in the Strategic Plan.

• It was pointed out that the Government capital programme would be developed taking

into account the programme for future development as set out in the National Planning

Framework and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and it was essential that

Limerick and the Mid-West be prioritised in conjunction with Cork and Galway to

provide a counter-balance to the growth of the greater Dublin area.

• Concerns were expressed in relation to the impact of the proposed Strategy on rural

housing and the subsequent impact on the rural parts of Limerick and other areas of the

Mid-West.

• Members questioned the rationale for development as set out in the Plan, given the

urgent need to counter-balance the growth of the greater Dublin region.

• The fact that Cork was recognised in the draft National Planning Framework as an

**Emerging International Centre of Scale**, whereas Limerick was designated as **Important**

**National and Regional Driver of Growth** was counter-productive, given the need for an

access for development along the west coast to counter the growth of the greater

Dublin area.

• It was pointed out that the proposals, as outlined, were detrimental to any future

business growth in the county and detrimental to the rural economy.

Queries were raised in relation to a number of matters regarding the deadlines for

submissions and issues such as Metropolitan Area Strategic Plans which were raised in the

Issues Paper, and these were responded to by the A/Senior Planner.

The Chief Executive expressed his concerns with the proposals, referring in particular to the

draft National Planning Framework which recognised Cork as an **Emerging International**

**Centre of Scale**, while Limerick, Galway and Waterford would be recognised at a lower tier

as **Important National and Regional Drivers of Growth.** This would have significant---

implications for the development of Limerick into the future. He also expressed concerns

with the population caps as currently proposed and indicated that such caps would have

implications for the future growth of the towns and villages in Limerick and the Mid-West.

He referred to the background to the preparation of the National Planning Framework and

noted that while the overall concept was good, the actual outcomes as presented would not

facilitate the growth of Limerick and the Mid-West area as an effective counter-balance to

the Dublin area. There were also concerns in relation to the impact on rural areas and the

position whereby the Government capital programme would be developed taking into

account the framework as set out under the proposed Regional Strategy.

He expressed his thanks to the Members for their support in relation to the items raised by

the A/Senior Planner regarding items to be included in the submission and pointed out that

it might be appropriate to also seek to meet the Dáil Committee dealing with this issue.

A number of Members also referred to the need to brief the local Oireachtas Members and

to meet, where possible, with Government Ministers to set out the concerns of the Council.

It was agreed that a request would be submitted to the Minister and the Department to

meet a delegation from the Council to raise this issue and, in addition, to meet with the

appropriate Dáil Committee to again set out the concerns. It was also agreed that Members

would make contact with the local Oireachtas Members and Ministers to express their

concerns and it was requested, in this regard, that a summary of the various items for

inclusion in the submission be circulated to each Member so that they could raise them in

any dealings with the Oireachtas Members/Ministers etc. Finally, it was agreed that the

Economic Development Directorate would prepare the formal submission, taking into

account the issues raised at the Meeting and that contact would be made with the Minister

and the Dáil Committee to arrange to meet the cross-party delegation from the Council at a

suitable time.

This concluded the Meeting.

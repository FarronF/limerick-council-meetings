 Mr. Conor Fitzgerald, Woodlands House Hotel, Adare.

 Mr. Paul Kavanagh, Grant Thornton.

Julie Tiernan under the following headings:---

 Importance of the Fitzgerald’s Woodlands House Hotel to the local area.

 Adverse impact of a badly positioned interchange to the Hotel.

 Impact on employment.

 Alternative interchange options/proposal.

Ms. Mary Fitzgerald outlined the history of the Fitzgerald's Woodlands House Hotel and

provided data in relation to employment figures at the hotel and future projections for

additional staff. She highlighted that 86% (or €886k) of hotel food purchases were from local

suppliers based within a 40km radius of Adare.

Mr. Conor Fitzgerald continued by explaining the adverse impact of a badly positioned

interchange to the hotel. He said that the hotel was currently part of the Adare Village

environs and the location of the proposed interchange would "cut off" the hotel from the

village and visitor traffic. He added that based on the hotel's forecasted financial

performance, the negative impact could be as high as €3.7m annually by 2027.

Ms. Julie Tiernan provided details in relation to alternative interchange options. She advised

that investigations had been carried out by Punch Engineers and Grant Thornton which had

indicated that locations beside the Lantern Lodge were possible from an engineering

viewpoint. She stated that the location of the interchange could be a catalyst for positive

promotion of the "Natural Entrance" to Adare by the current mini-roundabout at the

Lantern Lodge. Further technical information was provided in relation to alternative

interchange proposal.

In conclusion, it was stated that an interchange linked directly to the Lantern Lodge

roundabout would mitigate the impact of the by-pass. A poorly positioned interchange

would lead to job losses in the hotel and reduce economic activity in the area (local

suppliers and community support).

The Mayor and Members thanked Mary Fitzgerald (Woodlands), Gearoid Costelloe (Grant

Thornton) and Julie Tiernan (Punch Consulting Engineers) for the presentation and strongly

voiced their support for the proposals brought forward by the Fitzgeralds and made the

following points in relation to same during discussion on this item:

 The Lantern Lodge needed to be protected as it was seen as the original entrance to

Adare.

 While in favour of the by-pass, Members stated that they would not support any

proposal which could result in a loss of jobs.---

 The importance of the Fitzgerald’s Woodlands House Hotel to the local area was

highlighted: employed approx. 230 people locally; €14.7 million in payroll costs for the

period 2012-2017; forecasted growth to 300 employees over the next 10 years; €100m

in economic contribution to the economy of Adare and its environs since its foundation

in the early 1980’s.

 A badly positioned exit from the by-pass would result in a significant loss of business,

with knock-on consequences for jobs, capital expenditure and local suppliers.

 It was stated that alternative interchange options beside the Lantern Lodge were

possible from an engineering perspective.

 The Members requested that serious consideration be given to the economic impact of

the current proposal for the Woodlands House Hotel and that the financial impact

analysis prepared by Grant Thornton, submitted by the Fitzgeralds, should be evaluated

by an Economist.

 Fitzgerald’s Woodlands House Hotel was the largest rural SME employer in West

Limerick and the largest tourism employer in the Limerick area.

 It was noted that there had been unanimous support for the Fitzgerald’s proposal at the

local District Meeting.

In response to issues raised by the Members, the Director, Physical Development, replied as

follows:

 A number of meetings had already taken place between the Mid-West National Road

Design Office and the Fitzgeralds, along with their Consultants, to discuss their

proposals.

 The Council was working towards final design and remained open to submissions.

 It was stated that an Economist had been engaged to consider and report on the

business case submitted by the Fitzgeralds.

 A significant amount of consideration had gone into the layout of the proposed junction

with a number of alternatives considered.

 The impact of all submissions would be taken into consideration and the Design Team

would have to stand over the design proposals with An Bord Pleanála.

 An Bord Pleanála would be the ultimate decision-maker.---

The Director, Physical Development, confirmed that there would be a further design update

for the full scheme in February which would be presented to Members before submission to

An Bord Pleanála. He added that it was expected that results on economic impact would be

available at that stage.

This concluded the Meeting.

**'Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,’ in order to facilitate sub-**

**Limerick.”**

The Chief Executive stated that there was still substantial work to be done in relation

matter should be referred back to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee

Recommendation was agreed.

(v)

Circulated, report of the Chairperson of the Environment Strategic Policy Committee

dated 16th November, 2017, in relation to Meeting of the Committee held on 23rd

October, 2017.

Councillor Scanlan, Chair of the Environment Strategic Policy Committee, presented

an overview of matters discussed at the Meeting and outlined the following

Recommendation which was agreed at the SPC Meeting:

**Recommendation**

**“That, Limerick City and County Council, being deeply concerned with the Government’s**

**new waste management proposals, write to the Minister for Communications, Climate**

**Action and Environment, Mr. Denis Naughten, T.D., asking him to stop these new changes,**

**establish a national regulator, introduce more measures to reduce, reuse and recycle**

Economic Development Directorate

(a)

Opera Centre Site

The Chief Executive stated that in order for a Local Authority to carry out any

substantial development, it would be necessary to go through a consultation process,

known as a Part VIII process. He added that if the proposed development was of such scale

that it required an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR), then the Local

Authority would be required to apply to An Bord Pleanála to proceed.---
10

With regard to the Opera Site, he said that the consultation process under the Part

VIII Regulations had begun on 22nd July, 2017. A total of 38 submissions had been received.

While the submissions covered a number of issues, the one that was of concern was the

question raised as to the absence of an EIAR.

He said it was important to point out that the proposed development was, from a

technical perspective, sub-threshold and that the screening report carried out by the

Consultants supported that position.

The Chief Executive went on to say that, having considered the submissions and in

particular the issues raised in relation to the absence of an EIAR, and the legal advice sought

in relation to the questions raised, he had determined that an EIAR should be prepared. He

added that this had the effect of recommencing the planning process by applying to An Bord

Pleanála for approval. The consequences of this approach would be a delay of a number of

months in the planning process. However, this approach would minimise the risk of

substantial delay which could be associated with projects of this scale. This approach would

also deal with the concerns raised through the consultation process to date.

He concluded by stating that it was important to point out that this would not delay

the preparations for the development of the site in terms of its timelines as the project

management phase would run in tandem with the planning process.

In response to queries from Members, the Chief Executive reiterated that, in this

instance, the Council was now the applicant for this development and that he would consult

with the Full Council before submitting the application to An Bord Pleanála. He assured the

Members that he would listen to the views of the majority of Full Council.

(b)

Southern Region - Issues Paper – Initial Public and Stakeholder Consultation – November

2017; and (ii) Notice in relation to Pre-Draft Public Consultation.

The A/Senior Planner addressed the Meeting on this item by stating the purpose of

the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) in terms of supporting the

implementation of the National Planning Framework; the purpose of the RSES Issues Paper

which was to seek public views on what should be included in the Strategy; the fact that the

RSES would influence and guide Limerick’s Development Plan and Local Area Plans over the

next 12 years, the content of the proposed Strategy i.e. location, form and density of

housing, location of employment, Metropolitan Area Strategic Plans, key growth enablers.

She concluded by stating that the closing date for public submissions was 26th January,

2018.---
13

A lengthy discussion took place on the item and the following points were made by

Members:

• Members expressed their disappointment with the document.

• They asked who was rejecting the Council’s submission.

• As there was no town in Limerick with a population of over 10,000, this would mean

that Limerick would lose out.

• It was noted that a submission made to the Regional Assembly had not been taken

into account.

• It was said that the Department and the Regional Assembly should abandon limit on

growth and percentages.

•  Shannon Airport was a critical piece of infrastructure and there was no mention of it

in the National Planning Framework.

• Need for Workshop and Special Meeting to further discuss the matter and prepare

submission.

• Plan gave Dublin and Cork more advantage over Limerick and would add to rural

depopulation.

• Plan had opposite effect in terms of re-addressing balanced regional development.

• Investment in Limerick should be recognised.

The Chief Executive said that the National Planning Framework and the Regional

Spatial and Economic Strategy were a critical issue for Limerick in terms of capacity to grow.

He also expressed concern in relation to the tight timeline proposed - it was proposed to

have the RSES adopted by end of December 2018. He confirmed that the Council had

engaged with all relevant agencies from the very start and that this was its strength, and he

assured the Members that he would bring these groups/agencies back together again in

relation to preparation of the RSES submission.

It was agreed that a Workshop and Special Meeting would be arranged on the issue

as a matter of urgency.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt

with:

9.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will ask at the next Meeting (a) how many overground slurry systems are in Co. Limerick,**

**(b) how many have bunded areas; and (c) what is the average cost to install bunded areas**

**around these systems.**

**REPLY:**

It is believed that, based on permissions granted, there are approximately

230 overground slurry towers in Co. Limerick.

The Council cannot confirm how many of these towers have bunds, but

believes it is likely that relatively few of the towers have bunds.

Where bunds are being put in place, they are generally installed at the time

of construction, remote from the tank using the soil removed from the

excavation for the tank and existing landscape features. The cost is therefore

just that associated with having a machine and driver on site and is generally

fairly minimal.

As such, it is difficult to quantify an average cost as the cost of putting in

place the bund will vary from case to case having regard to the size of the

bund, the gradient of the land, time of construction etc.

10.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many tenants of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)**

**Scheme are not on the housing list as requiring public housing.**

**REPLY:**

In order to be eligible for HAP supports, all applicants must, in the first

instance, qualify for the housing waiting list. All applicants in receipt of HAP

are in receipt of social housing support. HAP tenants are entitled to remain

on the transfer list for consideration for a social housing tenancy. Our records

indicate that all HAP tenants have opted to remain on the housing transfer

list.

11.

Question submitted by Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many dogs have been seized by Limerick City and**

**County Council in 2017, how many were registered, how many were reclaimed, how many**

**were re-homed, and how many were put down.**---

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will move at the next Meeting that farmers who have built overground slurry storage**

**construction must be grant-aided to carry out any upgrading works (to include bunded**

**areas) required by the Council, and call on the Department of Agriculture to provide the**

**required grant-aid.**

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, said that farmers who had built

overground slurry storage systems had done so in accordance with Department of

Agriculture Guidelines, with the assistance of Department Grants, and subject to planning

permission granted by the Council. He referred to letter that had been sent by the Council

to a number of farmers with overground slurry holding facilities advising of pending

inspections of same. He pointed out that farmers were concerned at the financial

implications of these inspections in terms of direct costs in relation to the possible

construction of bunds to hold slurry temporarily in the event of a spillage from these slurry

tanks. He concluded by stating that the Council should call on the Department of Agriculture

to provide grant-aid for any upgrading works.---
23

Councillor Teskey, in seconding the Motion, said this matter had been discussed in

detail at a Special Meeting of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale and, at that

Meeting, it had been agreed that a presentation provided to the Members there by the

Senior Executive Engineer, Physical Development, would be drawn up as a brochure and

circulated to farmers who had already been contacted by the Council, together with a

covering letter outlining the Council’s concerns and recommendations. He asked if the

brochure and letter had been circulated.

**Item 2: To Consider the Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan**

“I will move at the next meeting that the current burial ground bye-laws are amended to

permit the standard of maintenance and structure of headstones & kerbing that applied in

graveyards for a period in excess of twenty years”.

The Chairperson pointed out that a full reply to the notice of motion had been circulated by

email prior to the meeting.

The S.E.O. outlined that the Council was attempting to recognise and legislate for the

protection of burial grounds from a social, heritage, amenity and cultural point of view.

The Members expressed the following views or concerns:

 The importance of recognising that a ‘one size fits all’ approach will not work for both

old and new cemeteries in the city and county.

 Awareness that practices which work in county burial grounds may not work in city

burial grounds and vice versa.

 The importance of recognising that the purpose of graveyards/cemeteries is to allow

families to bury loved ones, friends and family members in a manner they deem fitting.

 Support for a policy of no large headstones and no kerbing in new graveyards, while in

older graveyards, new headstones and kerbing should be consistent with existing

headstones and kerbing in that graveyard.

 The belief that derogations from the Bye-Laws should be applied to certain burial

grounds and the need for more consultation with the burial ground management

committees.

 Acknowledgement that kerbing in graveyards represents a challenge from both a

graveyard management and a health and safety point of view.

 Recognition that there is an issue with people putting kerbing around graves without

prior permission from the Council.

 The view that LCCC’s application of the Bye-Laws appear to be stricter than that of other

local authorities, with a rigorous standard being applied which can sometimes cause

upset and distress to bereaved families.

 The view that discretion in the application of the Burial Ground Bye-Laws needs to be

exercised.

The Senior Executive Officer expressed his awareness of the sensitivity of these issues,

especially for bereaved relatives and families.

He pointed out that, while he understood the concerns expressed by the Members, there is

a requirement to strike a balance between the issues/concerns raised at this meeting and

the need for the Council to have a legislative basis to regulate the erection of headstones

and kerbing in graveyards.

He acknowledged that there is a challenge between striking a balance in relation to

preserving the antiquity and heritage of these cemeteries while also meeting the expressed

wishes of families of the deceased.---
The Executive Archaeologist stated that the issues raised by the Members relate to a

number of different Bye-Laws. She stated that Bye Law 28 relates to cemeteries which

contain national monuments or a location which is noted in the Record of Monuments and

Places or a structure which is entered in the Record of Protected Structures. She pointed out

that previous Burial Ground Bye-Laws also take cognisance of the height of headstones and

clarified that the height restriction of 500mm is specific to Kilmallock cemetery. Ms.

McCutcheon further clarified that Bye Law No. 28 does not apply in Mount St. Lawrence and

Mount St. Oliver cemeteries, confirming that the erection of headstones etc in these areas

would be governed by other Bye-Laws and in particular Bye Law 23 and 25.

However, the Members continued to offer the view that a ‘one size fits all’ approach would

not work in practice. Accordingly, it was recommended by the Members that, in light of the

issues and concerns raised at this meeting, the application of the Burial Ground Bye-Laws be

reviewed. It was also agreed that, following this review, that the matter could be referred

back to this SPC for further consideration.

This was proposed by Cllr. Daly, seconded by Cllr. Collins and unanimously agreed.

**Item 3: To** **Consider the Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. S. O’Ceallaigh**

Cllr. Mc Creesh stated that he did not agree that orthophosphate should be added to the

water supply and offered the view that all lead pipes in the city and county should be

replaced.

Members also expressed the following views/concerns:

 Acknowledgement that lead levels in the water supply are a health risk for people in

Limerick with lead pipe work at their homes/businesses.

 Concern that it is proposed to add another chemical to the water.

 Concern that the results of studies appear to be mixed on the use of

orthophosphates in water supplies.

 The need to provide clarity on the time it will take for orthophosphate treatment to

work.

 The view that there appears to be no major benefit to adding orthophosphate to the

water supply.

 The addition of orthophosphate is a cheap solution to the problem in Limerick.

 The concern that, once orthophosphate is added to the water supply, it will be

extremely difficult to remove it at any future date.

 Concern that there was no reference to Limerick County in Irish Water’s Limerick

Priority Project Customer Information Sheet.

Members expressed the view that there exists a lot of uncertainty in relation to the benefit

of the proposed orthophosphate treatment initiative and that there is an urgent

requirement for a meeting with Irish Water wherein the Council members would be

afforded the opportunity to raise their issues and concerns and seek clarification and

certainty in relation to the issues raised above.---
The Senior Engineer clarified that Irish Water’s Lead Mitigation Strategy applies to the whole

of the city and county and that orthophosphate treatment would also be rolled out in the

county.

He stated that approximately 3,000 to 4,000 connections in Limerick have lead and that

exceedences in relation to lead in Limerick are on the private side rather than on the public

side. He also stated that based on HSE advice, Limerick would be ill-advised to decline the

proposed orthophosphate treatment. He also stated that orthophosphate treatment does

not pose any health risk. He pointed out that approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people in

Limerick are at risk from lead in their water supply with 10% being in the vulnerable

category i.e. babies, young children etc.

The Chairperson suggested that the Notice of Motion be deferred and that Irish Water be

requested to attend a meeting with all Members of the Council during the course of which

the issues as outlined above could be fully debated.

This proposal was recommended by Cllr. Collins, seconded by Cllr. Daly and unanimously

agreed.

**Item 4: Presentation on Climate Change**

Pat Stephens, Manager of the Limerick Clare Energy Agency gave a presentation on Climate

Change.

The Members thanked Mr. Stephens for his presentation and noted that a number of

interesting points were brought up.

 There was an acknowledgement that doing nothing in response to Climate Change is not

an option.

 Concern was expressed that the Council is not currently utilising renewable energy

solutions e.g the use of the water wheels in Corbally or the possibility of constructing

wind turbines on the land reclaimed from the Limerick tunnel to generate electricity.

 It was pointed out that if sufficient sources of renewable energy were utilised, Limerick

city could become carbon neutral with the possibility of running the public lighting from

the city from electricity generated from renewable energy sources.

 The recent flooding in Castleconnell and Montpelier were mentioned, however, some

members did not accept that the flooding was caused by the effects of Climate Change

but rather that the flooding was caused by lack of maintenance in the River Shannon.

 The view was also expressed that over-effective drainage of land could now have an

effect on the flooding of rivers and streams. A need to clean up the waterways and

streams and dredge the River Shannon was highlighted.

Mr. Stephen’s stated that the local authority has been guilty of not publicising the work that

has been done on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. He highlighted that the

Council is very active in energy efficiency measures e.g. energy efficiency initiatives in---
Council buildings, the retrofitting of houses and attempts to reduce dependence on

imported fossil fuels. He also stated that there is a Gas to Energy project in Gortadroma but

acknowledged that there is enormous capacity to do a lot more to de-carbonise towns and

cities. He clarified that it is statistically true that the level of pure rainfall has increased and

that there has also been an increase in severe weather events. The local authority must get

engaged with the local adaptation plan

Cllr. Teefy requested clarification on what body/agency is responsible for drainage/flooding

issues.

**Item 5: To consider the** **Council’s policy in relation to the provision of water connections at**

**burial grounds**

The Senior Executive Officer stated that the main difficulty that arises here is the cost

associated with providing the water connections. He stated that in terms of providing a

water connection, the cost can vary from approx €700 to €4,000 to €5,000 depending on

the work to be completed in order to provide the connection. The cost of water, i.e. buying

it from Irish Water would also need to be considered. He pointed out that there is already

severe pressure on the burial ground budgets with the costs of operations and maintenance

activities etc and clarified that at present, resources are not available to fund the additional

costs that would be required to provide water connections at burial grounds.

The Chairperson asked if an estimate of the costs that would be involved in the provision of

water connections for all burial grounds in the city and county could be prepared.

Members expressed the following views/concerns:

 It is a basic right to have a water supply in a graveyard.

 Water is needed in graveyards for watering flowers and for the cleaning of headstones.

 The possibility using Rainwater Harvesting Systems for making water available for

watering flowers was discussed.

 There was an acknowledgement that some graveyards in rural areas cannot be served

by public water supplies and it will not be possible to provide water connections at these

graveyards.

 The significant work being carried out by the burial ground caretakers and community

groups was acknowledged.

 It was questioned if some of the income from the purchase of graves could be used to

cover the costs of proving water connections at graveyards.

It was then proposed by the Chairperson that this matter be discussed at an SPC at a future

date when more detailed information on the cost of providing water connections at

graveyards was available.

The Meeting then concluded.---

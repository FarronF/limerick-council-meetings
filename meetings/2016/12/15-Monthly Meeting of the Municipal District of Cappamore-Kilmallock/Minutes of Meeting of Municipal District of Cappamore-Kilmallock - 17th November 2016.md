**Regional Services Directorate**

**Update on Waste Water Treatment Plant at Kilbehenny**

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that there was an existing wastewater treatment plant on

the L1585 beside the National School at Knockrour located 1km from Kilbehenny Village. The

system was a septic tank and Bord na Mona Puroflo which served three dwellings. There were

approximately eighteen dwellings/commercial properties in Kilbehenny Village which did not
---

have a wastewater treatment system. Following a complaint the Environment Section carried

out an investigation of septic tanks in the village and found that a number of dwellings were

connected into the surface water system.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that there were a number of options available for

consideration and read the following reply into the Minutes :-

“(i)

Irish Water – application for a new connection to Irish Water but this would have to be

funded by the applicants. The following reply was received from Irish Water :

*Kilbehenny village was an un-serviced area without Irish Water assets. Unfortunately*

*such un-serviced areas without Irish Water assets do not meet our qualifying*

*requirements for funding under our current investment criteria. As such the provision of*

*facilities in such centres will need to be underpinned by economic, social and*

*environmental justification along with a suitable funding mechanism and a sustainable*

*operation and maintenance model. Irish Water was supportive of initiatives to provide*

*drainage and treatment systems in smaller development centres that are currently un-*

*serviced and was engaging with DECLG, who had the lead role in this area, and other*

*stakeholders including Local Authorities in identifying a suitable funding mechanism and*

*a sustainable operation and maintenance model.*

(ii)

Application for a Group Sewerage Scheme where grants of up to 75% of the cost subject

to a maximum of €6750 per house.

(iii)

Examine grants to upgrade septic tanks if suitable”.

The Senior Executive Engineer added that the cost of providing a wastewater treatment plant

and network would most likely be prohibitive.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that Cork County Council was investigating a request from

residents in Carrigane approximately 500m towards Mitchelstown where there were

approximately fifteen rural houses some of which the Senior Executive Engineer understood

had difficulties with their septic tanks.

The Senior Executive Engineer said that in order to make a proper judgement on how best to

proceed the next steps were:-

(i)

Environment Section to carry out a survey of existing septic tanks in Kilbehenny;

(ii)

Following on from this the Senior Executive Engineer would submit an Asset Needs Brief

to Irish Water.

The Cathaoirleach thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for attending the Meeting.

**Item 2: To Consider Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

**I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council request Shannon**

**Airport Authority to provide a bi-annual (twice yearly) briefing to Members on its yearly**

**activities and current plans so that we, as a Council can support its success and advocate**

**for the needs of the people of Limerick.**

Cllr. Butler stated that there is a need to formalise Limerick City & County Council’s link with

Shannon Airport and to create a structure for communicating with the Shannon Airport

Authority. He pointed out that Clare Co. Council has already established a strong link with

Shannon Airport and that establishing a formal link in Limerick could help to influence

strategy and lead to local job creation and economic development in the city and county.

The Members agreed that the Council should be fully aware of Shannon Airport’s activities

and its current and future plans.

The Motion was seconded by Cllr M. Sheehan and unanimously agreed.

It was agreed by the Members that, having regard to the strategic importance of Shannon

Airport to the entire Limerick region, the proposed briefing should be presented to the full

Council. Members also agreed that the briefing would specifically relate to the current

economic and transport links between Shannon Airport and the Limerick region and on how

these economic and transport links could/should be developed and strengthened into the

future.

**Item 3: To consider Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cmhlr. S. Ó Ceallaigh**

**I will move at the next meeting that this Council renames William Street, Little William**

**Street and Upper William Street to Sráid Uí Dhálaigh, Sráid Uí Dháilaigh Bheag and Sráid**

**Uí Dhálaigh Uacht, in honour of Ned Daly.**

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh stated that he had not realised the amount of red tape involved in a

street name change but that he was seeking the support of the Members for this motion. He

stated that it is now 100 years since Ned Daly was executed in 1916 and that he would like

this SPC to approve the notice of motion. The Motion was seconded by Cllr Browne, who

also pointed out that the Council is also considering renaming the Square in Newcastle West

to Con Colbert Square.

The Director of Service explained the process that would need to be undertaken if the

motion was agreed and approved by this SPC.

The Members sought clarification on whether it is being proposed that William Street, Little

William Street and Upper William Street would now be renamed to Daly if this motion was

successful. Members expressed concern in relation to removing a name that has been

associated with Limerick City for hundreds of years and pointed out that William Street is

very well known both nationally and internationally.

After a vote, the motion was defeated by 10 votes to 3.

**Item 4: Presentation on Winter Road Maintenance Programme**

The Senior Engineer made a presentation on Limerick City & County Councils Winter Road

Maintenance Plan 2016 - 2017.

The Members thanked him for his informative presentation and commended the work being

undertaken by the Council outdoor staff on the Winter Road Maintenance Programmes.

The following items were raised by the Members:

 Concern that approx 90% of Roads are not routinely salted.

 Clarification on whether the local area engineers have some discretion with regard to

the salting of certain local roads e.g. local roads that may be highly traversed and have

large volumes of traffic or local roads that are at a high elevation or ensuring that roads

around facilities such as schools are salted.

 A query on the amount of funding that is provided by the NRA for the salting of roads in

Limerick and on what the cost is per night of salting.

 Clarity on whether most of the cost of the salting programme is made up of the labour

costs or the cost of purchasing the salt.

 A query on whether salt has a best before date.

 Clarity regarding whether money is lost on the salting programme due to the effects of

subsequent rainfall/flooding.

 Members stated that large housing estates can be some of the worst affected areas on a

frosty/snowy morning.

 Query as to whether the Council could develop a programme of engagement with

Residents Associations whereby residents would be provided with salt to carry out the

salting of the estates themselves.

 The feasibility of providing salt bins in certain areas/housing estates whereby the

residents can use the salt provided in the bins to carry out the salting of the estates

themselves. However, concerns over where the liability would lie if an accident occurred

were expressed for both of these scenarios.

 That more footpaths should be salted to cater for people that don’t drive e.g. elderly

people and people with disabilities.

 Concern that a large number of outdoor Council staff are now near retirement age and

the importance of replacing all of these staff when they retire.

In response to the items raised by the Members, the Senior Engineer provided the following

clarifications:

Limerick City & County Council will have a winter ready service plan completed and available

on the Council’s website. The Government also has a winter ready website:

www.winterready.ie. The Council’s winter service plan, in as far as reasonably practicable,

facilitates the safe movement of vehicular traffic, in accordance with agreed priorities, on
---
the more important defined routes of the road network, while minimising delays &

accidents directly attributable to adverse weather conditions.

He explained that current practice is to endeavour, within the limited resources available, to

maintain major traffic routes in a passable condition. He pointed out there is 24/7

monitoring of road conditions from the middle of October until the end of April, using

detailed predictions provided by Met Eireann, roadside weather stations, and ice prediction

software.

He confirmed that a fleet of 14 dedicated spreaders is used to spread salt on a strategic

network of over 670km of Priority 1 & 2 roads whenever road frosts are forecast, and

confirmed this network is detailed in maps in the Winter Maintenance Plan. 7 lorry-

mounted snow ploughs are used during significant snow/sleet conditions.

He also explained that the average life expectancy of salt is 3 years and that very little salt is

wasted due to flooding as, in general, flooding happens in milder weather conditions. He

confirmed that the cost per night of salting the roads in Limerick can vary depending on

whether the salting crews are required to go out and salt once or twice etc. He also

confirmed that the NRA provides funding for the salting of the national roads in Limerick.

He explained that the use of salt bins is not a common practice in Ireland. He further

explained that resources are required for manual salting and that the salt has to be stocked.

He pointed out that decisions would have to be taken on where to provide the salt bins as

there are over 1200 estates in Limerick.

He said that manual salting can cost significantly more than salting using specialist

equipment due to the amount of salt used during the manual salting process. He confirmed

that it may be more beneficial to invest money on machinery and specialist equipment

required for salting than to provide salt bins in housing estates to be used for manual

salting.

The Meeting then concluded.

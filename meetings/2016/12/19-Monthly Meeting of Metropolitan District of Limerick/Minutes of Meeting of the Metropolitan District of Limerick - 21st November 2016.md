**QUESTIONS**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many stray dogs have been seized in the Metropolitan Area***

***in 2016, how many have been reclaimed, how many have been re-homed and how many have***

***been put down?***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County employs two Dog Wardens and a Kennel Assistant who

are responsible for day to day implementation of dog control duties. These

duties include the operation of the Dog Shelter at Mungret, the seizing of stray

dogs, and the enforcement of statutory requirements such as the licensing of

dogs. The Dog Shelter also accepts dogs that are being surrendered by their

owners. The Council actively pursues the re-homing of dogs where possible and

liaises with dog re-homing charities in this respect. The Dog Wardens also carry

out inspections of premises on the Register of Dog Breeding Establishments.

The Council’s Veterinary Services and the Dog Shelter have dealt with in excess of

600 complaint/queries in relation to the control of dogs to date in 2016. The

total number of dogs handled by the Council in the Metropolitan District to 17

November 2016 is 269. Of these, 172 dogs were seized by the Dog Wardens, 87
---

dogs were surrendered to the Dog Shelter, and 10 dogs were collected from

owners who wished to surrender them.

For the Limerick Metropolitan area in 2016, a total of 28 dogs were reclaimed by

their owners, 117 dogs were re-homed and 122 dogs were put to sleep. 2 dogs

remained in the Dog Shelter at 17 November 2016.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many litter fines have been issued in the Metropolitan Area***

***for 2016?***

**REPLY**:

348 Litter Fines have been issued in the Limerick Metropolitan area in 2016 as at

16th November 2016.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting can an update be provided of the feasibility study planned for***

***the Raheen/Dooradoyle area with regard to selecting sites for a Community Centre.***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council considered the selection of a suitable site for a

Community Centre for the Raheen / Dooradoyle area. Consideration was given

to a site on the Mungret College Lands but this was deemed unsuitable because

of its distance from Raheen / Dooradoyle. The Council will continue to

investigate possible sites that may be suitable for a Community Centre and the

Elected Members will be updated accordingly.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting that the Homeless Action Team explain the discrepancy between***

***the numbers provided for levels of homelessness in Limerick at the recent SPC***

***meeting compared to those provided by the Department.***

**REPLY**:

The difference between the two figures reflects the following :

 Comparing different geographical areas.

 Comparing different time periods.

 Comparing numbers of clients accessing emergency accommodation during a

week compared to beds occupied on one night.

The update given to the SPC was based on specific details at that time on

individual clients in emergency hostel accommodation, it included details of

families in emergency hostel accommodation and those funded for B&B – it was

not a comprehensive list of all people in all accommodation deemed emergency

accommodation.

We have clients in apartments that we term ‘emergency apartments’, which are

self-contained independent living units, who were not included in the report to

the SPC, but are included in the report to the Department.

According to our monthly report sent to the Department of Housing (September

2016) and published on the Departments website there are 237 individuals and

67 children accessing Emergency Accommodation in the Mid West Region

including Co. Clare and Limerick.

This reflects a snapshot week of clients accessing emergency accommodation

during the week 19th September – 25th September. This also includes clients

discharged and admitted during that week. It reflects the numbers of clients

accessing the service during a week as opposed to the numbers of beds occupied

on any specific date. There were 21 individuals (18 families) and 36 children

accessing B&B, and 9 individuals and 16 children accessing Suaimhneas.

As of 14/11/16, according to PASS data, there were 193 adults and 56 children

being accommodated through emergency homeless accommodation provision in

Limerick. Of these:

 19 adults and 28 children are funded to access hotel or B&B accommodation

in Limerick.

 6 adults and 16 children are accommodated in Suaimhneas (supported hostel

for families)

 103 adults are in emergency hostel accommodation between McGarry House,

Thomond House and St. Patricks Hostel.

 10 adults and 12 children are accommodated in apartments which we identify

as emergency accommodation, but which are self-contained and independent

accommodation units.

 55 adults, who have identified themselves as homeless, are receiving

treatment in Cuan Mhuire Treatment Centre. Please note the Cuan Mhuire

Treatment Centre offers services to clients from locations nationwide. (On

14/11/16, only 7 of the 55 clients identified themselves as from Limerick City

or County – however, the full figure of 55 is included in the report to the

Department, on the basis that the centre is located in County Limerick).

Total: 193 adults and 56 children.

A rough sleepers count on the 21 October 2016 found one adult sleeping rough.

He declined emergency accommodation and was provided with a sleeping bag.

The Gardai checked out private properties anecdotally identified as places where

people are sleeping rough, no rough sleepers were found. The Gardai are

continuing to monitor the situation and are liaising with the Limerick Homeless

Action Team.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the promised new council staff will be employed on permanent***

***contracts, to ensure job security and help stem the increase in short term, insecure contracts?***

**REPLY**:

A total of 16 temporary General Operative/General Operative C1 Drivers have

been appointed on a permanent basis with effect from 28th October, 2016. These
---

staff have been appointed following success at competition. All of the staff

involved had prior to permanent appointment held temporary contracts of

employment with Limerick City and County Council.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Joe Leddin and Elena Secas (to be referred**

**to the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District is opposed to the removal***

***from this Council of planning powers for estates of 100 or more houses to An Bord***

***Pleánala which, if introduced, will further damage local democracy.***

Councillor Leddin noted that this motion was to be referred to the Economic Development,

Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee and requested that the motion be debated

by the District as the related Bill may have passed through the Dáil by the time the Strategic

Policy Committee had considered the motion.

Following a show of hands to indicate those Members who wished to debate the motion, the

Mayor declared that the motion would not be debated.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch**

***I will move at the next Meeting**that Limerick City and County Council re-consider putting in***

***place a temporary night shelter in the city to cope with the overflow of homelessness between***

***the months of October and March end of the following year.***

In proposing the motion, Councillor Lynch noted that there were a small number of individuals

who did not wish to avail of existing services for the homeless and stressed that a night shelter

where such individuals could dry out and avail of showering facilities, soup, tea / coffee and

shelter would be of huge benefit as the Winter weather takes hold.

In seconding the motion Councillor Leddin acknowledged the work being carried out in this area

and expressed his disappointment at some of the media coverage of the recent tragic death of

Louise Casey and called for such coverage to be more objective and sensitive.

Members welcomed the motion and made the following points while discussing same:

 There was a need for more emergency accommodation as an increasing number of people

could not afford to pay rent.

 A number of people were afraid to use homeless accommodation because of issues around

drug use.

 There was a discrepancy between the extent of homelessness being reported and that

witnessed on the ground. Many individuals staying in deserted properties were not being

included.

 Much of homelessness arises from mental health issues and the violent and erratic

behaviour associated with drug abuse. A wide range of services were required to deal with

these issues.

Mr. Steve McNamara, Administrative Officer, Homeless Action Team informed Members that

the Limerick Homeless Action Team (LHAT) had commenced its Winter Beds Initiative in

partnership with McGarry House, Thomond House and St. Patrick’s Hostel. Eight beds were

allocated on an emergency night by night basis by LHAT and these acted as a backup to the 101

emergency hostel accommodation beds provided on an ongoing basis in Limerick. He stressed

that LHAT were actively looking for people in need of emergency accommodation and that the

development of a drop in café style facility was being looked at. He noted that extensive fire

safety requirements were associated with homeless units that provided sleeping

accommodation and stressed that the long term goal was to get people into a home of their

own.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Costelloe**

***I move at the next Meeting that this District requests a briefing from Regeneration in relation***

***to ongoing works and the overall Regeneration plan.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Costelloe highlighted the level of hope that regeneration

plans had brought to the communities involved but noted that, to date, the emphasis of the

physical plan had focused on demolishing rather than building houses. He raised the case of an

84 year old resident who had applied for a thermal upgrade of their property two years

previously and asked that the regeneration plan be reviewed.

In seconding the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh indicated that the extent of houses being

demolished was not sustainable and expressed the view that the regeneration programme

would not be delivered due to lack of funding.

Members welcomed the motion and made the following points in relation to same:

 That people in the regeneration areas would be happy to return there.

 Only those houses constructed from mass concrete should be demolished. Instead 30 year

old houses were being knocked while 80 year old houses were being refurbished.

 While lots of work had been done in the social development area, economic development

was not advancing at the same pace.

 The staff on the ground were best placed to decide in relation to house demolitions.

 A zero planning levy should apply in the regeneration areas.

**REPLY**:

A Review of Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation, two years after

the Plan’s formal adoption in February, 2014, has been completed by Limerick

City and County Council. The Review provides an overview of the performance of

the Social, Economic and Physical Pillars with recommendations to progress as

part of the Council’s work-programme in 2017. The Review will be formally

launched on 9th December, 2016 by Minister Coveney and copies of the Review

will be made available to all Elected Members, in addition to being made

available online at www.limerick.ie, after the launch.

A briefing for Councillors on the review of the Limerick Regeneration Framework

Implementation Plan will take place on Friday, 2nd December, 2016 at 2.30pm in

the Council Chamber, Dooradoyle.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh and Councillor Malachy**

**McCreesh (to be referred to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***We will move at the next Meeting that this District requests a meeting with Bus Éireann in***

***relation to Bus Routes and Bus Stops in the Metro District.***

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted the intention to transfer this motion to the Travel and Transportation

Strategic Policy Committee and indicated that this issue was a matter specific to the

Metropolitan District and that discussions relating to individual bus routes was not a policy area

of concern to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee. The Mayor confirmed

that the motion would be sent to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District write to the Minister for***

***Health requesting him to urgently intervene to speed up the opening of the new Emergency***

***Department at University Hospital Limerick.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Prendiville.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller noted that the Accident and Emergency Department

in University Hospital Limerick was operating far in excess of its design capacity with high

numbers of patients on trolleys for protracted periods. He noted the number of missed opening

dates for the new Accident and Emergency facility and called on the Minister for Health to

investigate the reason for these delays and ensure that this facility is opened in the immediate

future.

Members supported the motion and acknowledged the efforts of the Accident and Emergency

Staff working in difficult circumstances. Members noted that the new Accident and Emergency

facility had been built but was awaiting fit out and the recruitment of the additional staff

needed.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District write to Irish Cement***

***condemning their recent threat to cut jobs in Limerick and urging them to retract that***

***statement.***

At the outset the Mayor reminded Members that it would not be appropriate to stray into

planning issues during the discussion of this motion.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

Members noted their need to represent the general public and the employees of Irish Cement

in this regard and called on Irish Cement to engage fully with the public in relation to their

proposed development at Mungret.

On the proposed of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Hurley, it was agreed that the

motion be amended to read as follows :
---
9

“That Limerick Metropolitan District write to Irish Cement condemning their recent threat to cut

jobs in Limerick, urging them to retract that statement and asking Irish Cement to outline its

future plans for employment in the Limerick Region”.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District support the recent calls for***

***extra funding to be provided to*** ***expand Novas’ Community Detox scheme so that it can also***

***work with those struggling with alcohol and codeine addiction in this District.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that a recent review of Novas’ Community

Detox Scheme had identified the need to expand the service to other addictions and expressed

his disappointment that the Council had not allocated funding to same during the budget

process. Members noted that Novas’ Community Detox Scheme was funded by the Mid West

Regional Drug and Alcohol Forum and that the motion should be brought to the attention of

same.

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Marian Hurley**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council upgrades the road between the Annacotty***

***end of Shanbally Road to Carrinderry leading to Castletroy College to include new footpaths,***

***cycle lanes, road drainage and public lighting, similar to works carried out in 2016 at Walkers***

***Road. This upgrade is needed to connect Annacotty Village with new residential areas to its***

***west as well as the new Gael Scoile and Castletroy College.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hurley and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hurley acknowledged the work already carried out at

Shanbally Road Upper and highlighted the need for works at the location outlined in the motion

due to the heavy machinery using this road and the need to make the road safer for those who

live and work in the area. A number of Members pointed out that this motion related to an

issue that should have been discussed at the Operational Briefings and noted that similar

motions, when submitted by them, had not been included on the agenda.

**REPLY**:

The road in question is about 200 metres long and is quite narrow. There

are residential properties along most of one side of the road and two residential

properties on the other side. There is about 8 metres in width between

opposing extended front boundary lines. This is insufficient for footpaths and

cycle lanes and is enough for just a footpath along one side of the road.

Otherwise significant encroachment of front gardens would be required which is

unlikely to be welcomed by the property owners. I recommend that a scheme be

costed and considered for the 2017 Development Fund Allocation.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Marian Hurley**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District take in charge the open***

***green space at rear of Carrinderry House along Castletroy College Road. As the area has***
---
10

***become a magnet for litter I would ask that this space be suitably landscaped to include***

***cutting of grass and planting of suitable trees. The existing wooden fence currently in a***

***dilapidated state to be removed.***

The Mayor noted that this motion related to private property and would not be taken at the

Meeting.

**19.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted.

This concluded the Meeting.

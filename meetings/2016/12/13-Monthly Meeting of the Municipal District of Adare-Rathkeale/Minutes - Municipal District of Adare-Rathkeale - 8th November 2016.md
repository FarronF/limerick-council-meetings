4. Adoption of Minutes

held on 4" October, 2016.

Proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue;
Seconded by Councillor McMahon;
And Resolved:

“That the draft Minutes, as circulated, be taken as read, adopted and signed”.

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach Councillor Sheahan noted the issues he had raised at the
previous Meeting in relation to the lack of progress by Irish Water in upgrading the waste water
treatment facilities at Askeaton. He pointed out that the sewers in Askeaton were comprised of
combined waste water and storm water pipes, with two overflow outlets in the middle of the
town, and that a licence to discharge partially treated sewage granted by the Environment
Protection Agency (EPA) had expired in 2014. He noted that several houses in Askeaton also
discharged waste water directly to the river Deel and called on the Council and the EPA to carry
out their functions to protect the quality of water adjacent to Askeaton.

Councillor Sheahan pointed out that the sewerage discharge pipe from the existing plant had now
been moved to the centre of the river and that the discharge from same should be timed to
coincide with the outgoing tide. Members agreed with the sentiments expressed by Councillor
Sheahan and it was suggested that the sewerage needs of Foynes and Askeaton should be
reviewed in conjunction with the design of the new Limerick Foynes Road.

It was agreed that the three local TD’s and Irish Water should again be written to in relation to the
need for an upgrade of the Askeaton Sewerage Treatment facilities and that the relevant Minister,
the Taoiseach, local Senators and the EPA should also be contacted in this regard. Members also
agreed that Irish Water and the EPA should be invited to the next Meeting of the District.

of Adare-Rathkeale held on 25" October, 2016.

2. Deputation from Kilcornan Community Council

It was agreed that Item 2 would be taken in conjunction with the related Item No. 15 on the
Agenda.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Kilcornan Community Council to the Meeting.
Ms. Gillian Downes, Chairperson of the Community Council addressed the Meeting and thanked
Members for their continued support in relation to issues of traffic calming and route lighting
since the last meeting in Kilcornan in September, 2015. She outlined details of the contact the
Community Council had had with TIl and the Council in relation to this issue and expressed

disappointment at the lack of progress to-date.

Members thanked Ms. Downes for her presentation and noted that the commendable steps taken
by the community council in facilitating the drop off and collection of school pupils at the rear of
the school had weakened their negotiating position. Members stressed the need for traffic
calming and safety measures at this location and expressed their dissatisfaction at the lack of
progress and the lack of engagement by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (Til).

Members noted that Kilcornan was the only National School in the District located on a national
road and suggested that the classification of the required works as Emergency Works might
encourage the Department of Education to provide grant aid towards same. Members agreed
that all relevant TD’s and Ministers should be written to in relation to this issue and that a
deputation from the Adare-Rathkeale District comprising District Members, representations from
Kilcornan Community Council and the executive should meet with TII to discuss this issue.

The Cathaoirleach noted the related Motion under Item No. 15 on the Agenda submitted by
Councillor O’Brien as follows:-

“1 will move at the next Meeting that the TIl and/or Limerick City and County Council install
traffic route lighting in the vicinity of the Kilcornan primary school and entrance to the Ger
McDonnell all-weather playing facility and Kilcornan Community Centre together with enhanced
traffic calming and safety measures at this location.”

REPLY: Limerick City & County Council has previously consulted with Transport
Infrastructure Ireland (TIl) with respect to the provision of Public Lighting and
Traffic Calming Measures in the vicinity of Kilcornan NS/Community Centre. They
are in agreement that works would be beneficial at this location and have agreed to
consider proposals from Limerick City & County Council. In accordance with their

procedures for requests of funding, a feasibility report has now been requested.
This is currently being prepared and will be submitted to TIl before the end of

November.

It was agreed that the feasibility report would be made available to District Members when
finalised.

The Senior Executive Engineer noted that the feasibility study would focus on the area between
the entrance to Curraghchase and Kilcornan school/community centre site.

Members also noted the need for traffic calming at the nearby church and the Senior Executive
Engineer pointed out that, while this could also be looked at, it would not form part of the

feasibility study area.

3. Economi irectorate

Great Southern Trail

The Senior Executive Officer gave a presentation to Members detailing works planned to convert
the Great Southern Trail to a greenway thereby ensuring minimum disruption for cyclists and
pedestrians using the route. He noted that, as the route traversed a number of Districts, the
related Part Vill process would be brought before the full Council.

Members welcomed the proposals and it was suggested that a plaque to the group of volunteers
who had started this project and brought it thus far should be erected on the route.

In response to issues raised by Members the Senior Executive Officer noted that an annual
maintenance budget for the route was in place. In relation to the potential use of an old stone
Palatine building in conjunction with the route, he pointed out that this could be considered as
part of a subsequent Part VIII.

4. Operations & Main ic
Kilbraden Burial Ground

The Executive Archaeologist informed the Meeting that the caretaker at Kilbraden Burial Ground
had retired a number of years previously and had not been replaced as there were no new graves
to be allocated there and any further burials were to be confined to existing family plots. She
noted that the graveyard maintenance committee had, however, since allocated and marked out
graves that impinged on old graves and had been requested to undo same.

Councillor Sheahan noted that unfortunately the message had gone out locally that no further
burials were to be allowed. He pointed out that he had since had discussions with Council staff

and the position had been clarified.

Askeaton Reference No. P.P.S. 2016/A to the Record of Protected Structures in accordance with
Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

Members discussed how the proposed route of the proposed Limerick Foynes Road would be
impacted by the addition of Ballycullen House to the Record of Protected Structures and the effect

this might have on adjacent landowners.

The Director, Regional Services informed the Members that the item before them required them
to decide whether to add Ballycullen House to the Record of Protected Structures and did not
involve the Members in the design of the proposed Limerick Foynes Road.

Members noted that a decision in relation to Ballycullen House was required by 25™ November
2016 and agreed that the item be deferred to a Special Meeting of the District to be held on 14™
November, 2016 at 6.00 p.m. in Rathkeale.

Foynes Road, the proposed curtilage associated with Ballycullen House and adjacent land holdings
be made available for the Meeting.

(b) Update on Derelict Sites in Rathkeale

At the request of the Cathaoirleach it was agreed that Item No. 11 on the Agenda would be taken
in conjunction with this item.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

“1 will move at the next Meeting for the Council to give an up-to-date account of what buildings
are deemed to be in a derelict state in the town of Rathkeale. | wish to know what efforts have
been made by this local authority to address the current state of some properties within the
town that could fall or are already in this category. The Derelict Sites Act 1990 allows the local
authority to prosecute owners who do not comply with notices served, to purchase land
compulsorily and to carry out necessary work themselves and charge the owners for the cost. |
wish to know how many owners to date have been prosecuted within the boundaries of the

above mentioned act.

The A/Senior Planner gave a presentation to Members on derelict and vacant sites which included
the following:-

e The definition of a derelict site and the procedure involved in placing a site on the Derelict
Sites Register.

© Details of 13 derelict sites on the Register for Rathkeale including properties about to be
removed from the Register and in addition, potential derelict sites.

e Background to and details of requirements on Planning Authorities in relation to the
Vacant Site levy.

The Cathaoirleach thanked the A/Senior Planner for his presentation and circulated photographs
of a number of buildings in Rathkeale and raised concerns at the condition of these properties and
that some appeared to be in a dangerous condition.

The A/Senior Planner noted that any dangerous structure would be acted on immediately while
the procedure relating to derelict sites were more protracted.

The following points were raised by Members during discussion of this item.

¢ Many properties in Rathkeale had shutters attached to the windows and should be

considered derelict.
e¢ The 3% levy applied to derelict sites was inadequate and should be applied as compound

interest.

¢ A report on the unfinished developments at Ballywilliam, Monk Hill and the People’s
Bakery should be provided for the next Meeting.

¢ Dereliction was an issue in Askeaton and a work programme should be put in place to

address same.

The A/Senior Planner informed Members that Askeaton could not be prioritised at that time due
to the limited number of staff available to work on derelict sites.

noted that two of the estates listed were in Glin and not in the Adare-Rathkeale District.

In response to queries from Members the A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that a CCTV survey
of the underground services at Marine Cove had been carried out and a snag list for the estate was
being drawn up. In relation to Asgarde Cove he pointed out that the required works would go to
tender and that the vacant site there was privately owned. Members indicated that this site had
formed part of the planning permission for the estate.

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey.

It was noted that this Item had been considered in conjunction with Item 5 (b) on the Agenda.

NOTICES OF MOTION

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that the footpaths in Foynes be inspected in conjunction with a
representative of St. John of God, who have many residents using wheel chairs in Foynes, with a
view to having the footpaths designed for use by the residents of that institution.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Sheahan noted that wheelchair users, resident in St. John of
God, Foynes, had difficulty accessing footpaths to the west of the facility forcing them to stay on
the road in places. He requested that the footpaths be dished appropriately to facilitate
wheelchair access.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer verified that he would meet with a representative of St. John of
God in the coming weeks.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that Cios Sruthain, Croom be taken in charge.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Sheahan pointed out that he could see no reason why this
estate should not be taken in charge as he anticipated that the Council could deal with any issues
that might be in place, in due course.

Members raised issues in relation to a fence that had been erected across a portion of land that
was considered part of the open space associated with the estate and also in relation to the safety
of the site where it ran parallel to and above the old Cork Road. Members asked that ownership
of the disputed portion of land be established and agreed that the matter be adjourned to the
next District Meeting, with a detailed map of the area to be taken in charge made available to the
Members. Members also asked to be provided with proposals for any alternative portion of land
that would be provided as open space, should the disputed land not form part of same.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

| will move at the next Meeting that this local authority takes into consideration the floor level
of all houses when assessing road works.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey noted instances where road works resulted in the
raising of the road level above the floor level of adjacent property with the potential for rainwater
to drain from the road into such property. He suggested that in such instances the road should be
first lowered then brought back to its original level with the new road making material.

In seconding the Motion Councillor Keary noted that while property owners must not allow water
to drain from their property on to a public road there was an onus on the Council to ensure that

the reverse did not happen.

Members suggested that road drainage issues should be included as part of the planning
permission granted to a property.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that, in general, the cost of road reconstruction would be
prohibitively high were it to include for the initial lowering of existing road surfaces. He stressed
that every effort was made to take levels into consideration and to dish roads to facilitate the run
off of surface water to adjacent dykes. aki

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

It was noted that this Item had been considered under Item No. 2 on the Agenda.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O'Brien

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council install a pedestrian
crossing on the Main Street Pallaskenry at the Community Centre in the interest of road and

student safety.

The Cathaoirleach advised Members that in the absence of Councillor O’Brien this Notice of
Motion would be deferred until the next Meeting.

17. Correspondence

Correspondence was noted.

The following issues were raised at the conclusion of the agenda :-

In relation to Lees Cross the A/Senior Executive Engineer noted that an application for low cost
improvement works was in hand and signage would be reviewed.

Councillor O’Donoghue raised concerns in relation to the safety of the junction at Nevilles Cross
where there was poor sight lines and the extension to the adjacent Public House had increased
traffic volumes. The A/Senior Executive Engineer undertook to review this location.

This concluded the Meeting.

LIMERICK ON WEDNESDAY, 23°° NOVEMBER, 2016, AT 9.00 A.M.

PRESENT IN THE CHAIR: Councillor A. Teskey, An Cathaoirleach.

MEMBERS PRESENT:

Councillors Keary, O’Brien, O'Donoghue and Sheahan.

OFFICIALS IN ATTENDANCE:

Director, Regional Services (Ms. C. Curley), Meetings Administrator (Mr. T. O'Callaghan), Senior
Executive Technician (Mr. M. O’Brien), Executive Engineer (Mr. D. Flanagan), Staff Officer (Ms. K.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Inspector Alan Cullen to the Meeting.

Inspector Cullen highlighted details of the policing plan for the District at Christmas which included
areas such as public order, rural crime, burglaries, the licencing laws, illegal parking and offences
under the Road Traffic Act. He noted that he had discussed the use of exclusion orders, where
appropriate, with the Council's Housing officers and that these had proved successful in the past.
He pointed out that it was intended to bring relevant offences to the Courts as soon as possible
with a view to the prevention of a recurrence of similar offences.

Members raised a number of issues of concern and Inspector Cullen clarified the following in
response to same:-

e All Gardai in the Newcastle West District would be involved in the policing plan with
dedicated overtime available and manpower varying in accordance with activity and in
response to issues that arose.

e In relation to traffic issues in the town of Rathkeale, a small dedicated traffic core would
supplement existing resources.

¢ Temporary dwellings on public footpaths would be addressed on a case by case basis with
issues such as public safety and theft of electrical power taken into consideration.

¢ In relation to late night joy riding by youths and the impounding of the vehicles used,
vehicles could be seized while a case was being investigated but the vehicle must be
released if the owner presents and the issue is resolved.

Customs had similar seizure powers to the Gardai in relation to vehicles.

¢ With regard to speedy access to Courts during the Christmas period, the Court calendar
was not yet available and access to Special Courts would be limited, based on the gravity of
the offence.

e A drug plan was in place and Customs Officers search ships arriving into ports in the area.
There was no evidence that the Shannon River was being used as a route to illegally
imported drugs and any specific information in relation to the illegal importation of drugs
would be welcomed by the Gardai.

¢ In relation to the use of dogs to detect drugs, reasonable ground for a search would have
to be established before a warrant was issued in such cases.

¢ The law distinguished between mechanically propelled vehicles and dwellings and the
Gardai could only act within the law.
The Gardai liaise with police in the UK in relation to serious crime.
Work with the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) was ongoing but it should be noted that CAB
must prove that an asset was the proceeds of crime in order to secure a high court order to
seize such an asset.

e The policing plan would be reviewed on a daily basis and extra resources would be
targeted as required.

¢ Any garda number in the District, not manned, would hunt on to the Newcastle West
Station which was manned 24 hours per day.

The Director, Regional Services noted that the Council had kept a keen eye on unauthorised
parking the previous Christmas and a case had been taken to Court in relation to same. It was
noted that this case was still in play and the Council had 24 hour access to the next Court should

there be a breach.

The Cathaoirleach thanked Inspector Cullen for his update and Members stressed the importance
of maintaining adequate Garda numbers in Rathkeale during the Christmas period, given that the
population of Rathkeale would probably double during that period with up to 350 additional
mobile homes introduced. Members welcomed the opening of the Garda Station in Croom and
stressed the importance of members retiring from the force being given the opportunity to pass
on their extensive local knowledge to their replacement, before retirement.

This concluded the Meeting.

Cathaoirleach

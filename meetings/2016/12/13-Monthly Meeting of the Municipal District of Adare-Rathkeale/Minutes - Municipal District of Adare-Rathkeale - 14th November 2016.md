1. Service Operations Directorate — Planning & Environmental Services
(Proposal to add one structure to the Record of Protected Structures).

Circulated, Report of the Senior Planner dated 28 October, 2016 enclosing the Chief Executive's
Report on the proposed addition of one building, a country house at Ballycullen, Askeaton,
Reference No. P.P.S. 2016/A, to the Record of Protected Structures in accordance with Part IV of
the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). Also circulated three maps, updated
September 2016, showing provisional 100 m corridor and provisional junction locations for the
Foynes to Limerick Road Improvement Scheme and also showing the proposed curtilage to be
included as part of the proposed addition to the Record of Protected Structures.

At the outset Councillor Keary expressed his dissatisfaction at not having been provided with
1:2500 maps of the location as he had previously requested. Councillor Keary also pointed out the
difficulty involved in reviewing maps using an iPad.

The Conservation Officer informed the Meeting that he had received legal advice which indicated
that it would be inappropriate to become in any way involved in the alteration or re-routing of the
proposed Limerick to Foynes Road arising out of the decision to place the house at Ballycullen,
Askeaton in the Record of Protected Structures.

Members noted that they had no intention of encroaching on the functions of the Transport
Infrastructure Ireland (TIl).

The Conservation Officer outlined the rationale, as set out in the Chief Executive’s Report, that
supported the addition of Ballycullen House and the associated curtilage, to the Record of
Protected Structures and made the following points in response to issues raised by Members;

¢ The term curtilage was not defined in the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as
amended) but was generally considered as those lands that were dependent on the house
for their existence and included buildings, fixtures and landscape of significance to the
house that were classed as being for the immediate benefit and use of the occupiers.

e In determining the curtilage in this particular instance reliance was placed on the Demesne
Lands depicted on the Ordnance Survey's First Edition 6” Mapping of the 1840's — the

extent of such lands depended on ‘gentlemen's agreements’ between the land-owners and
the army officers supervising survey work in the 19" century.

e The shelter belt to the north, west, and south of Ballycullen House could be considered an
important benefit to the occupants of the house.

e While the Council’s Development Plan required that the settings and amenities of
protected structures be protected there was no reference to the provision of a 25 m
exclusion zone adjacent to the boundaries of protected structures.

¢ Ballycullen House had been recommended for addition to the Record of Protected
Structures by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and, in accordance with
Section 53 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, where the Planning Authority
decides not to comply with such a recommendation it shall inform the Minister in writing
of the reason for its decision.

The Director, Regional Services pointed out, in the interests of openness and transparency, that
Ballycullen House had been listed in both the 1999 and 2005 Developments Plans but that an error
had been identified when the 2010 Plan was being prepared and that, consequently, it was
dropped from the Record at that time.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O’Brien it was agreed that the
Meeting be adjourned for 10 minutes.

On the resumption of the Meeting, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor
O'Brien the following Motion was agreed.

“That the addition of Ballycullen House to the Record of Protected Structures as proposed in the
Chief Executive’s Report dated 28” October, 2016 should not be made at this point as it was
considered that, while the appropriate procedures were followed, the impact of the process was
not understood. The Members of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, as a result, request
that the addition of Ballycullen House to the Record of Protected Structures be reconsidered and
the process be reinitiated to ensure all parties are afforded an opportunity to comment”.

This concluded the Meeting.

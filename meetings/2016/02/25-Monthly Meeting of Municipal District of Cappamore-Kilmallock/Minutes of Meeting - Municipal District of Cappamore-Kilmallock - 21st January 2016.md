***I move at the next Meeting that immediate repairs take place to the footpath in front of the***

***Community Hall on Main Street Hospital in the interest of public safety.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy and seconded by Councillor Mitchell.

former Bank premises, which was now a restaurant.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor G. Mitchell**

***I will move at the next Meeting that regular inspections are carried out of gulleys, culverts,***

***pipes, watercourses to determine that they are fit for purpose and in working order***

***throughout the year.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Mitchell stated that climatic conditions were changing due

to heavier rainfall and inspections should be carried out on gulleys, pipes, etc. to ensure they

were in working order.

The motion was seconded by Councillor Donegan.

**REPLY**:

Manpower resources are not available to carry out regular inspections

throughout the year on drainage infrastructure. Landowners are responsible for

the maintenance of drainage infrastructure on their own properties under the

Roads Act 1993 as amended. Limerick City and County Council responds to

reports of blocked pipes usually by employing a specialised drainage contractor

to free them. Ongoing maintenance of roadside inlets/gullies continues to be

carried out, with a special emphasis during November following the shedding of

leaves.

Members expressed their disappointment with the delay in the recruitment process for

General Operatives. The Acting Head of Finance/Human Resources/Corporate/ICT confirmed

that it was hoped to have the General Operatives appointed in the next couple of weeks.

The following items were raised at the completion of the Agenda:

Members thanked staff in the Kilmallock Office who were available over the Christmas period

when houses in Galbally had been at risk of flooding.

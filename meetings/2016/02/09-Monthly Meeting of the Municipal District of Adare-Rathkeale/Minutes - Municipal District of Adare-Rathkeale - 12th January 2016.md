And Resolved:

“That the draft Minutes, as circulated, be taken as read, adopted and signed”.

The following issues were raised by Members, after the adoption of the Minutes, with the consent
of the Cathaoirleach.

Members discussed the selection process for the preferred route corridor (orange route) for the
new Foynes to Limerick Road and noted that the timeline for receipt of submissions by the public
on the preferred route corridor had already been extended to 29" January, 2016. Members
stressed the need for the public to be fully aware of the rationale behind the selection of the
preferred route and to be in a position to take this into consideration when making submissions.
Members noted that many concerns had been raised by the public in relation to access to and
exits from the proposed new road and the creation of cul de sacs. Councillor Keary proposed that
the executive summary, due to be published in March 2016, that outlined the rationale to the
selection process for the orange route, be made available to the public as soon as possible and
that the closing date for submissions be extended to a date after the publication of the executive

Members indicated that Foynes had not been serviced by proper road/rail and that a high quality
road connection between Foynes and Limerick was necessary in order for Shannon Foynes Port
Company to compete against other ports in Dublin and Cork. Members highlighted the need for
the new Foynes to Limerick Road to be of dual carriage way standard to cater for future needs.

The Director, Regional Services, indicated that, while the preferred route corridor had been
identified, detailed design for the new road had yet to be carried out. She acknowledged the
Members’ concerns regarding the timing of submissions and undertook to discuss same with her
colleagues and revert to the Members.

Councillor Neville indicated that he had formally requested, at the December Meeting, that the
taking in charge of Ballyvareen Estate remain on the agenda until resolved. Councillor Sheahan
pointed out that he had requested the need to provide footpaths from Adare to the GAA grounds
to remain on the Agenda also. Councillor Sheahan stated that if an item was proposed and
seconded to remain on the agenda it must remain on the agenda.

Deputation from Rathkeale Community Council at the next monthly meeting.

QUESTIONS
4. Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will ask at the next Meeting for a progress update on the proposal requesting something to be
done on Askeaton and the lack of employment opportunities for people without adequate
training.

REPLY:

Very serious and violent incidents took place in Askeaton, primarily in Church View Estate,
on the weekend of the 30/10/15-1/11/15, arising from a family feud among the travelling
community in the town. Some of the parties alleged to have been involved are resident in
Council-owned properties and some in private accommodation.

Immediately on being notified of the events, staff from the Estate Management
Unit of the Council visited a number of houses within Church View, and other
locations, to (i) offer reassurance and support to those residents who were left
traumatised and frightened and (ii) speak to representatives of the families
involved.

Continuous liaison is taking place between the Council and An Garda Siochana. The
latter has devoted considerable resources to investigating the incidents and
mounting regular patrols to prevent any further escalations. Two individuals have
been before the District Court charged with serious offences and are currently on
bail to addresses outside the town. As the investigation progresses, it is possible
charges may be laid against others involved. Obviously, the Council has to await
the outcome of the various court cases before being in a position to take any
definitive action against any of its tenants that may be convicted. However, in the
meantime, it is intended in the immediate future to call a number of tenants in for
formal interview and caution.

To provide reassurance to the peaceful and law-abiding members of both estates,
and to improve security, provision has been made to install CCTV cameras in both
Church View and Lismakeera Estates. It is hoped that this work can be completed in
the very near future.

The Estates Liaison Officer will continue his work with those residents that are
interested in effecting improvements to the living environment. Discussions will
also be held with West Limerick Resources to see if that body can assist in any way.

The matter was discussed at a meeting of the Traveller Accommodation
Consultative Meeting held on the 18th December last.

NOTICES OF MOTION

5. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

Following on from my request to have a pedestrian crossing installed at Colaiste na
Trocaire, Rathkeale | will move at the next Meeting that pedestrian crossings be installed
at all the primary schools in the town also.

Councillor Sheahan, in proposing the Motion indicated that, as the Council were in charge of local
roads, they were in a position to install pedestrian crossings on roads in their charge. He indicated
that there were a number of national schools in the district in need of pedestrian crossings and
work on same should be commenced.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor O’Brien indicated that pedestrian crossings were beneficial for
both the elderly and children and queried their cost and what rationale was used for their

installation.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer informed the Members that the cost of pedestrian crossings
varied from €25,000 to €50,000 depending on the nature of the site and the extent of the civil
works required. There was also a requirement to provide public lighting for distances of 100m on
both sides of a pedestrian crossing. The Operations Manager informed Members that the
installation of the pedestrian crossing at St. Annes National School was proposed for approval as it
was identified as a more urgent case.

Councillor Sheahan requested that the pedestrian crossings at both Colaiste na Trocaire and St
Annes National School by installed at the same time. Councillor Keary also supported the Motion
and indicated that a temporary school warden should be appointed for Rathkeale in the interim.

REPLY: St Annes National School is being proposed for approval under the GMA-Local
Roads - 2016. Other locations for pedestrian crossing at schools will be examined in
more detail during 2016. The installation of pedestrians crossings will be subject to
adequate funding being made available.

6. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that the Gardai provide a progress report on the behaviour of
the public in Rathkeale during the Christmas period.

Councillor Sheahan indicated that there was a greater presence of An Garda Siochdna in Rathkeale
over the Christmas period and this resulted in fewer incidents of anti-social behaviour. He
requested a progress report from the Gardai, Planning and Fire Services on the behaviour of the
public in Rathkeale during the Christmas period.

Councillor Keary referred to the opening of an unofficial halting site at Enniscoush housing estate
in Rathkeale where seven caravans were illegally parked and indicated that youths were causing a
disturbance from 2 a.m. in the morning. He indicated that a survey was carried out by the
Community Council on 31° December, 2015 which indicated that 338 caravans were illegally
parked at 169 locations in Rathkeale and added that the Council should be doing more to address
the problem of unofficial halting sites in the town. Members noted the proliferation of gas
containers associated with the influx of caravans each year at Christmas time in Rathkeale, and the
lack of powers available to the Fire Authority to deal with the associated fire risks. Councillor
Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O'Donoghue proposed that legislation be enacted that would
allow Fire Authorities to deal with any hazards associated with these gas bottles and that the
Minister be written to in this regard.

Ze Correspondence

Councillor O’Brien expressed his dissatisfaction with the reply from Irish Water regarding the
District’s request that houses, from Murphy’s Cross to the Town Hall in Adare, not connected to
the local sewerage scheme be serviced with sewerage connections, in conjunction with the
Proposed N21 Adare Western Approach Improvement Scheme. Members noted the large number
of houses that could be provided with sewerage connections at this location and the waste of
resources and poor public image that would be portrayed when, at some later point, some of the
works to be carried out under the improvement scheme are undone to service these houses. It
was noted also by Members that lands adjacent to the above road were zoned residential and
they called on Irish Water to survey same and take the future servicing requirements of these
lands into consideration. The Members requested that Irish Water reconsider its decision on this
matter and, at a minimum, make provisions for an appropriate sewerage main, available for future
use, to be laid as part of the improvement works.

The following items were discussed at the conclusion of the Agenda with the consent of the
Cathaoirleach.

Councillor O’Donoghue highlighted the need to paint speed ramps in Croom.

Members raised the issue of water pressure in Adare and requested that the Fire Service be
written to, to establish if the water pressure in Adare was sufficient, from a Fire Service viewpoint,
to deal with any fires that might occur. Members also requested that Irish Water be written to, to
establish their views in relation to water pressure in Adare and any plans they may have in relation
to same.

Councillor Sheahan requested that the Environment Department be notified of regular dumping of
refuse into the river at Askeaton in the early hours of the morning.

Councillor O’Donoghue queried if the water pressure in Croom was adequate. He noted that
Croom was supplying water to Banogue and that 22 leaks had been detected in one month in
Church Road. He stressed that these issues had been ongoing for the past two years and
requested the time line for the upgrade of the water system. The Operations Manager, South and
West Division indicated that he would consult with the Water Services Department and revert to

Members.

Members expressed concern that stray dogs were killing farm animals and that owners of dogs
were walking land with their dogs and causing a nuisance. They indicated that all dogs should be
chipped and licensed. The Director, Regional Services, indicated that it was a civil matter if dogs
were being walked on private land.

Councillor Neville indicated that in the mornings the stop/go system for traffic going into Limerick
City from Ballyneety was not configurated correctly. The Operations Manager, South and West
Division, indicated that he would look into the matter.

Councillor Keary requested an update on the status of the two derelict cottages in Adare that
went on fire during the summer of 2015 and noted that the new tourism season was commencing
shortly. He requested that no constraints be imposed on the repair of these properties that would
limit their fire safety.

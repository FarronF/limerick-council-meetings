8. uestion subm ncillor M. Collins

1 will ask at the next Meeting if the recently laid road surface at Killarney Pole, Newcastle
West as part of Barnagh Phase 2 realignment scheme be checked for safety reasons.

REPLY: The question apparently relates to a recent single vehicle collision at the Junction
of the Old Barnagh Road and the Ballintubrid Road in the area of the Killarney
Pole, and to occurrences of skidding in the vicinity of the new Killarney Pole
junction on the N21. It is the Council’s information that both types of incident

occurred during periods of frost.

The Council's on-site supervision team has confirmed that all of the relevant
checks carried out on the road pavements prior to Scheme opening complied
with the Contract Specification and hence the Council would not expect that the
road surface would be a factor in the cause of these incidents.

this area.

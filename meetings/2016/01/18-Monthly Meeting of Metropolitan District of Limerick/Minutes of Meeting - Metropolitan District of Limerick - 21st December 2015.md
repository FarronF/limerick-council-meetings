Department in taking on board concerns raised by the traders and those living in the area and

**Deputation to meet with NRA (now Transport Infrastructure Ireland)**

On the proposal of Councillor Hourigan, seconded by Councillor Byrne, it was recommended

that a nominee from each of the three Electoral Areas within the District should meet with

Transport Infrastructure Ireland and names would be submitted to the Director, Travel and

Transportation in due course.

Councillor Byrne raised the issue of Christmas parking arrangements in the city and proposed

that the Christmas arrangements be extended from the 24th December, 2015 to the 8th January,

2016. This was seconded by Councillor Lynch. Members noted that the Christmas parking

arrangements had extended into January last Christmas and expressed disappointment that they

had not been consulted in relation to changing what they had perceived as agreed practice.

The Director, Travel and Transportation noted that the extension of the Christmas parking

arrangements, as requested, would involve foregoing income, not budgeted for, but undertook

to discuss the issue with his colleagues and revert to the Members as soon as possible.

**Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting when the Council is going to pilot the 30km/h speed limits***

**Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas (to be referred to the Local Area**

**Operational Briefings)**

***I will ask at the next meeting what treatment options the Council has considered for the***

***section of the R445 road (Dublin Road) between the Kilmurry Roundabout and the entrance to***

***Munster GAA Offices and when the Council is going to carry out the improvement works.***

The Meetings Administrator informed Councillor Secas that it was proposed that this question

should be dealt with at the Local Area Operational Briefing.

Members noted that the Operational Briefings were working well in most instances but stressed

the need, at times, to escalate to District level issues that were not being dealt with to their

satisfaction at Operational Briefings. Members also stressed the requirements to raise, at

District Meetings, issues relating to the city centre which would be of concern to all Members.

On the proposal of Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Councillor Quinlivan, it was agreed that

the Mayor and Party Leaders should meet to discuss this issue.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***I will ask at the next meeting what solutions the Council has explored for safe road crossing***

***for children attending Milford National School in Castletroy and if the Council has considered***

***providing a school warden service for children’s safety.***

**REPLY**:

In order to confirm the full extent of current traffic issues in the vicinity of

Milford School the Council will undertake revised surveys of traffic in early 2016

along Plassey Park Road. The outputs from those surveys will allow the Council

to best examine the range of suitable options for this location to enhance the

safety of children crossing the Plassey Park Road from or to Milford School. It

would be premature to comment on any one possible solution before then.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the latest count to establish how many are***

***actually sleeping rough in Limerick and what measures have been taken to ensure that we***

***have no one sleeping rough this Christmas.***

**REPLY**:

The Limerick Homeless Action Team (LHAT) scheduled a rough sleepers count for

Wednesday the 9th of December 2015. This had to be postponed due to a

weather alert, it has been rescheduled for Wednesday the 16th of December.

LHAT endeavours to constantly monitor evidence of rough sleeping in Limerick.

We have ongoing liaison with the Garda Siochana, Approved Housing Bodies and

the HSE Emergency Department in order to identify any individuals actually, or at

risk of sleeping rough. Other individuals and agencies such as members of the

public, the media and elected members also aid in identifying transient rough

sleeping persons. LHAT has not received any indication that there are persons

consistently rough sleeping in Limerick.

The Limerick Homeless Action Team office hours are 9am to 5pm, Monday to---
5

Friday. Our telephone number is 061 481212. Anyone who is homeless or at risk

of homelessness is invited to present for assessment. From 5pm to 9pm, Monday

to Friday, and 12pm to 4pm Saturday and Sunday, an Out of Hours Service

operates, to which persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness may

present in person. An emergency telephone number 1800606060, operates 24

hours a day.

In November, Limerick City & County Council funded the Winter Beds Initiative.

Eight emergency beds are available through this initiative for individuals who

present to the LHAT, which are allocated on a daily basis. This service is provided

in addition to the existing hostel emergency accommodation, this provision is

adequate to meet current presented needs.

It should be noted that we are always planning ahead to be prepared in the event

of an increase in presentation, we are currently in discussions with a number of

agencies to have contingency emergency beds in place should the need arise.

Councillor Lynch indicated that he was not satisfied with the reply received and highlighted the

need for a walk in shelter in the city where people could avail of a warm drink.

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council provides the funding to implement a***

***permanent solution to the recurring flooding on Hyde Road close to the Byrne Avenue***

***junction.***

Councillor McCreesh noted that it was proposed that this issue be dealt with at Operational

Briefings but noted that this issue had been raised repeatedly at Operational Briefings but had

not been resolved.

Members supported the motion and stressed the need for funding to be sourced to apply the

appropriate engineering solution to this problem, which had been occurring for many years.

It was agreed that Item 11 on the agenda would be taken next.

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next meeting that this District calls on the Government to immediately act***

***on its promise to provide for flood defences in Limerick City, and to extend flood defences to***

***the Castleconnell/Lisnagry/Montpelier areas.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted the previous flooding of St. Mary’s Park, the

ongoing absence of adequate flood defences there and the fears of the residents in relation to

high tides.

Members acknowledged the great work carried out in maintaining flood defences during the

recent extreme weather but expressed concern at the flooding that had occurred in Corbally. It

was proposed by Councillor Quinlivan and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh that this District calls---
6

on Waterways Ireland to attend a Metropolitan Meeting to discuss the recent flooding of

Richmond Park, Corbally and its surrounds on Saturday 12th December, 2015. Reference was

also made to flooding in the general Corbally area and that this should be considered in

conjunction with the original motion.

Members referred to the impact climate change was having on extreme weather events and the

challenges faced by the ESB dealing with the slow flow of the Shannon and it was proposed that

all stakeholders come together to develop short and long term proposals to minimise flooding

and its impacts.

It was pointed out that sandbags had been stolen and damaged during the recent flooding and

that a hoax emergency call had been responded to during the flooding in Corbally. The public

were encouraged to come forward with any information they had in relation to these incidents.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next meeting that this District calls for prominence to be given to the Irish***

***Language in the Limerick 2020 bid and for the language to be included in the title of the bid,***

***making it Limerick2020Luimneach.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that the Irish language was a part of our

culture of which people were proud and could be an asset to the European Capital of Culture

2020 bid. He called for plans and events that promoted the Irish language to be included as part

of the 2020 bid.

**REPLY**:

The title of European Capital of Culture shall be awarded each year to a maximum

of one city in each of the two Member States appearing in the calendar set out in

the Annex of **Decision 445/2014/EU**, which governs the European Capital of

Culture Union action for the years 2020 to 2033. Under the formal criteria it

states “an English version of the application will be the working version for the

panel (jury) established to carry out the selection procedure”. With this in mind

the bid book was prepared in English.

The visual identify and logo for the Limerick bid is indicated as Limerick 2020. We

will ask the creators of the visual identity to address the idea of including

Luimneach in the next iteration of the visual identity.

The bid itself must ensure a relevant European Dimension and within this context

Limerick will include a project that will highlight the growing diversity of Limerick

and the increasing numbers of new Irish and migrants and the resultant number

of languages spoken in Limerick, including the Irish language. We acknowledge

that the Irish language is a vital part of our living heritage.

Members indicated their support for the Irish language and a suggestion was made that an

alternative Irish language version of the logo be used in some circumstances. Members also

noted that, as we were applying for European Capital of Culture Status, other cultures had to be

taken into consideration.---

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh indicated his satisfaction with the response he had received to his notice of

motion. The Meetings Administrator informed the Members that the Council’s logo in the

District Chamber would be reviewed early in the new year with a view to giving equal

prominence to the Irish and English language.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Michael Hourigan**

***I move at the next meeting that the double yellow lines on Honan's Quay at the back of the***

***old Dunnes Stores, that were put in place to facilitate loading, be removed and replaced with***

***normal disc parking measures. The store has been closed now for many years.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hourigan and seconded by Councillor Quinlivan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Hourigan noted that these double yellow lines had been put

in place 10 years ago, the adjacent building was not longer in use and these double yellow lines

were no longer appropriate.

The Meetings Administrator informed Councillor Hourigan that this item would be raised at the

Local Area Operational Briefing.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler**

***I will move at the next meeting for the Council to engage with the relevant organisation to***

***begin a process of removing the now redundant phone boxes from the city centre.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Hourigan.

Councillor Collins noted that in other cities redundant phone boxes were used as wifi hot spots

and for charging phones.

The Meetings Administrator informed Councillor Butler that this item would be raised at the

Local Area Operational Briefing.

**14.**

**Correspondence.**

Correspondence was noted.

At the conclusion of the meeting the Mayor thanked Members for their contributions and

wished everyone present a peaceful and happy Christmas.

This concluded the Meeting.

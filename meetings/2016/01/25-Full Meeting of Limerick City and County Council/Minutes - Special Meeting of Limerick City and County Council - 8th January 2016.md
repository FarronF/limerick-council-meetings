The Mayor then proceeded to thank everybody for attending the Special

Meeting explaining that it was being held in order to pass a Vote of Sympathy

for former Councillor and Mayor, Terry Kelly, who had passed away. Deep

sympathy was expressed to her family, friends, neighbours and community for

their great loss.

Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. It was stated

that the former Councillor had been born into a very politically prominent

family. Her father, Anthony Barry, had served in the Dáil and Seanad and had

served as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1961/1962. Her brother, Peter Barry, had a

very distinguished political career. He had been Minister for Foreign Affairs,

Minister for the Environment and former Lord Mayor of Cork. Her niece, the

MEP Deirdre Clune, had also served as Lord Mayor of Cork.

The former Councillor had moved to Limerick with her family in 1974 where

they became the proprietors of the Shannon Arms on Henry Street. Despite

the death of her husband in 1980, and her heavy family and business

commitments, Terry Kelly took an active part in the public life of Limerick City.

Terry was a passionate believer of education and was particularly interested in

the Women’s Movement. She was one of the founders of Adapt, which had

provided accommodation and support for women and children who were

subjected to domestic abuse. The Members referred to Terry’s great love and

passion for art and architecture.

From 1979 to 1985, Terry Kelly had served as a Member of Limerick City

Council and had served as Mayor from June 1983 to June 1984. She was the

second Lady Mayor of Limerick, following in the footsteps of Frances Condell,

and then followed by current Minister for Education, Jan O’Sullivan, Fine Gael’s

Councillor Maria Byrne, and Independent Councillor, Kathleen Leddin. She was

described as a progressive Mayor who had pushed the boundaries. During her

Mayoralty, she was described as a fantastic ambassador and advocate for

Limerick at home and abroad. Members referred to Terry as a lovely lady, who

had served the City well and who had adopted a stately approach while in

office.

Members said that Terry worked tirelessly to enhance the co-operation

between Limerick City Council and the business community in Limerick. She

was described as a pillar of the community who had fought hard for issues and

for the people she represented. She was very much respected by her

constituents. In turn, she was extraordinarily helpful, professional,

hardworking and committed to the area she represented.

Members said that Terry Kelly had served Limerick proudly and with great

distinction. She was a firm believer in the symbolic traditions associated with

the Office. Even though she did not run in the Local Elections of 1985, she

remained interested in politics all her life.

Terry had made a major contribution to the public life of the country, through

her roles in the Heritage Trust, Crafts Council of Ireland, Irish Landmark Trust,

EBS Building Society and Design Yard.

Members referred to Terry’s family and, in particular, the wonderful care and

support which Terry had received from them over the last number of years

during her illness which, they said, was second to none. It was stated that this

was an extremely hard and difficult time for her family.

The Chief Executive paid tribute to Terry on his own behalf and on behalf of

the staff and extended sincere sympathy to her family, community and friends.

He made reference to the very important traditions associated with the

Mayoralty and stressed the importance of preserving and continuing these

traditions going forward.

The Mayor concluded by saying that he had attended the funeral and had met

with Terry’s family. He said it was a very sad occasion but that her family was

very appreciative of the representation from Limerick and to those Members

who had travelled to either Dublin or Cork to convey their sympathies.

The Mayor then asked the Members to stand for a silent prayer.

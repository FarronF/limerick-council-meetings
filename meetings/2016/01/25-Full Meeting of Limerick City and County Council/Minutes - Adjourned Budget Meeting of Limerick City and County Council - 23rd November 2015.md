The Mayor opened the Adjourned Meeting by stating that formal notification had

been received on Friday evening, 20th November, 2015, from the Department of the

Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to once-off payment of

€1,191,546 to Limerick City and County Council to part-meet the deficit resulting

from the global valuation of utilities undertaken by the Valuation Office. The Mayor

invited the Chief Executive to read the letter into the Minutes of the Meeting as

follows:

“Section 53 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, provides for global valuations

of utility undertakings, to be carried out by the Valuation Office, every five years

and entered on the central valuation list. The Commissioner of Valuation is

responsible for the valuations. The most recent global valuations carried out by
---

the Valuation Office are in respect of Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnród Éireann and

telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and

Meteor. On 4th November, 2015, the Valuation Office issued a copy of the

Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value to each

rating authority. The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010.

The Global Valuation Certificates show a reduction in the combined valuations for

these utilities of €112m. This will impact on the rates payable by the utilities in

2016 and beyond. Moreover, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB,

following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, will reduce the rates payable by the

ESB from 2016.

The Department is fully aware of the challenges that the combination of the timing

of the revaluations and the number of utilities involved has caused, coming at such

an advanced stage of the budgetary process. In this regard, the Department has

engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there will be

a once-off adjustment in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local

authorities affected by the global valuations. In this regard, the Department will

be making an additional allocation of €1,191,546 to Limerick City and County

Council.

It should be noted that the additional allocation being provided is on an

exceptional and once-off basis, solely for the 2016 budgetary period. Where global

valuations occur in the future, it is important that local authority budgetary

processes make provision for potential reductions in valuations. In this regard, the

Department will engage with the Valuation Office on the timing of future global

valuations.”

Following some discussion, on the proposal of Councillor Collins (M), seconded by

Councillor Clifford, it was requested that the Valuation Office be invited to meet with

the Council to review this matter further as the original indication had been that this

process would be revenue neutral.

On the proposal of Councillor Collins (J), seconded by Councillor Collins (M), it was

also requested that a request be sent to the Department seeking the full amount of

the deficit in this case.

Following further discussion, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by

Councillor Hourigan, it was agreed that the Meeting would adjourn for a period of

one hour to consider the implications arising from confirmation of the additional

funding in this case.

On resumption of the Meeting and at the request of Councillor Gilligan, the Chief

Executive outlined his proposals for amendments to the Draft Budget to take account

of the additional funding of €1,191,546, details as outlined hereunder:

These proposals were circulated to all Members in hard copy.

In response to a number of queries, the Chief Executive confirmed that he was

proposing to the Members the adoption of the Budget, as circulated, subject to the

amendments as outlined by him to take account of the additional income of

€1,191,546. In this regard, the additional monies received from the Department

would be re-distributed across the Divisions and he was therefore still proposing a

4.5% increase on the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) for 2016.

The Chief Executive advised that following a request from the Members, contact had

been made with the Valuation Office and it was confirmed that Mr. Patrick Conroy,

Valuation Manager, Valuation Office, was not available to attend a meeting with the

Members during the prescribed period for the adoption of the Budget.

Members expressed their disappointment in relation to this matter and requested

that further contact be made with the Valuation Office in relation to the possible

attendance of other senior staff from that Office.

Councillor Prendiville indicated that he would be proposing an amendment to the

Draft Budget to provide for an increase in the Refuse Subsidy Scheme to a total of

€1,036,155, an increase of €274,847 for the Small and Medium Business Support /

Tourism Support Scheme, and an increase in the ARV to 5.6%. The A/Head of

Finance was requested to cost these proposals in the format required for

amendment to the Budget. The proposals were subsequently costed and were

circulated to all the Members as *‘Amendment to Draft Budget – AAA (Anti-Austerity*

On behalf of the Labour Party, Councillor Daly proposed that additional funding for

the Refuse Subsidy Scheme be provided to include Old Age Pensioners, Widows,

people on Invalidity Pension, Deserted Wives Pension and Blind Person’s Pension.

This would require a provision of €291,110, and the remaining €918,020 to be used

to reduce the ARV to 2.75%. The A/Head of Finance was again requested to

formally cost this proposal. A costed proposal in this regard was subsequently

circulated by hard copy to all Members, as summarised hereunder. This was

seconded by Councillor Leddin.

It was proposed by Councillor Ryan and seconded by Councillor Sheahan (K) that

the Refuse Subsidy Scheme be phased out over three years and that the saving of

€172,000 for 2016 be added to the General Municipal Allocation (GMA) for 2016.

It was proposed by Councillor Browne and seconded by Councillor Sheehy that the

Council would request a Special Meeting with the Valuation Office prior to the

conclusion of the Budget. In addition, it was also proposed that the Minister for

Finance be written to demanding that the €2.45 million be provided by central

government for the next three years.

Councillor Gilligan proposed that, in line with the wish of the Fianna Fáil Group, the

Refuse Subsidy Scheme in the County be abolished with the finance saved in

respect of same put towards the Metropolitan District. This was seconded by

Councillor Loftus.

A number of queries were raised by Members and clarifications were sought in

relation to some items in the Draft Budget. These were responded to by the Chief

Executive and the A/Head of Finance.

At this point, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor

Collins (M), it was agreed to adjourn for a period of one hour and fifteen minutes.

On resumption of the Meeting, the Meetings Administrator read into the Minutes of

the Meeting an e-mail received from the Valuation Office as follows:

“I refer to your e-mail and the Councillors’ request that a senior member from the

Valuation Office attend a Special Meeting to explain the revaluation appeals and

the global revaluation processes.

As you are no doubt aware, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the

exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act, 2001, and the making of valuations

is the sole prerogative of his Office.

Under the law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of

rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The

Commissioner has no function in deciding the amount of rates payable by a

ratepayer in any calendar year. This is a product of the valuation, determined by

the Valuation Office, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV). The

calculation of this rate is a Reserved Function of the Elected Members of the Rating

Authority.
---

The position is that all appeals to the Commissioner arising from the Limerick

revaluation under Part 7 of the Valuation Act 2001 have been determined and

there are now a number of appeals pending before the Valuation Tribunal. As

regards the global valuations referred to, these seven utilities, or their

predecessors, were first valued in 2005 and subsequently valued in 2010. In line

with the 5-yearly cycle prescribed by Section 53(6) of the Act, the Commissioner

recently completed the 2015 valuations for these seven utilities.

Therefore, having regard to the foregoing, I would consider it inappropriate for a

senior member from the Valuation Office to attend a budgetary meeting or a

meeting that would be associated with or in any way connected to the budgetary

process which is completely independent of the functions of the Commissioner.”

A number of other queries were raised in relation to various aspects of the Chief

Executive’s proposal and other proposals as put forward, and these were responded

to by the Chief Executive and the A/Head of Finance.

Councillor Ryan agreed to withdraw his earlier proposal in relation to the phasing out

of the Refuse Subsidy Scheme in light of clarification received from the Chief

Executive in relation to the procurement process for the scheme.

At this point, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor

Hourigan, it was agreed to adjourn for 20 minutes.

On resumption, the Mayor advised that it was his intention to adjourn the Budget

Meeting for a further period and that the scheduled November Meeting of the Council

would go ahead as planned at 3pm. On the proposal of Councillor Clifford,

seconded by Councillor Collins (M), the Meeting then adjourned.

On resumption at 4pm, on the proposal of Councillor Collins (M), seconded by

Councillor Sheahan (J), it was agreed that the Meeting would adjourn for one hour.

The Meeting reconvened at 5pm. Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that following

exhaustive negotiations, significant progress was being made in relation to

agreement for a Budget and, in this regard, he asked for a further adjournment of 30

minutes. This was seconded by Councillor Collins (M) and agreed.

On resumption, Councillor Collins (M) took the opportunity to thank all the Members,

Chief Executive and staff for their patience and assistance throughout the budgetary

process. He was now proposing that the rate increase proposed by the Chief

Executive would be reduced to 2.03%, giving an ARV of 0.2459.  There would also

be amendments to the Budget as proposed by the Chief Executive as follows:

Councillor Sheahan (J) seconded the amended Budget as proposed by Councillor

Collins (M).

Councillor Sheahan (J) went on to say that he too wished to thank Members, the

Chief Executive and his staff, and the media for their support throughout the

budgetary process. He added that the Budget, as proposed, was set against the

backdrop whereby there was no increase in the Local Property Tax for 2016 and a

significant decrease in rates income due to the revaluation process. He referred to

the growth in the economy of Limerick and stressed the need to create buoyancy in

relation to rates income going forward.

Councillor Prendiville requested that additional costings be calculated based on the

additional income and cost savings as outlined in the Fianna Fáil / Fine Gael

proposal, plus €500,000 additional for the Refuse Subsidy Scheme and an extra 2%

increase on rates for the top businesses. On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J),

seconded by Councillor Collins (M), it was agreed to take a short adjournment to

allow for a costing in this regard.

When the Meeting reconvened, It was pointed out that there had been a number of

amendments to the Budget proposed throughout the day. These would now be

drafted into formal proposals for the adoption of the Draft Local Authority Budget,

with or without amendment. These would be taken in the order in which they had

been received.

Councillor Browne, on behalf of the Sinn Féin Party, indicated that the position

regarding the request for a meeting with the Valuation Office had been covered in

the correspondence from the Valuation Office and that the issue regarding writing to

the Minister for Finance had been dealt with by way of Notice of Motion at the

November Council Meeting. Accordingly, these matters could be considered as

having been dealt with.

The Meetings Administrator then proceeded to read out the formal proposal to take

account of the original amendment proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded

by Councillor Keller. Following some discussion on the matter, it was pointed out

that what was before the Council at this stage were formal proposals for the adoption

of the Budget, with or without amendment. There was some debate on the

sequencing of the proposals and it was agreed that the correct procedure was to

take them in the sequence in which they were submitted. Councillor Prendiville then

indicated that he would not be putting forward his amendment in the format of a

formal proposal for the adoption of the Budget.

The Mayor indicated that, on this basis, he would be moving on to the next proposal.

Following some discussion in relation to this matter, the Mayor adjourned the

Meeting for a period of 10 minutes.

On resumption of the Meeting, the Meetings Administrator referred to the

amendment on behalf of the Labour Party as proposed by Councillor Daly, seconded

by Councillor Leddin, which was set out in detail in the circulated costed document,

and this was read into the record by the Meetings Administrator as follows:

“**That,** the draft Annual Budget for the financial year ending 31st December,

2016, prepared and circulated by the Chief Executive, be amended as per the

Labour Party costed document.

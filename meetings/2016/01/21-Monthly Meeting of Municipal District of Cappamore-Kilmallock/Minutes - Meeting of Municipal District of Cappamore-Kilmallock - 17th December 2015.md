**REPLY**:

The consideration of feasible options by the appointed Engineering Consultants,

Kilgallen & Partners, is at an early stage for the O’Rourke’s Cross project. The

developed and is being used as the basis for a consideration of the feasible

solutions from the respective perspectives of safety, engineering buildability and

impact on the environment. It is expected that by Spring 2016 the preferred

option shall have been proposed by the engineering consultants. Following

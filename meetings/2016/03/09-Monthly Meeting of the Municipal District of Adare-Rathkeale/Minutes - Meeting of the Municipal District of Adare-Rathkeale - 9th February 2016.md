Members noted that, arising from a high tide and storm surge, flooding had occurred in Askeaton
on the previous day. Members indicated that the car park of the swimming pool had flooded and
expressed disappointment, given the swimming pool was constructed 10 years previously, that
due diligence had not been taken to ensure the facility was built at a level which was safe from the
risk of flooding but commended the dedication of council staff and volunteers in saving the pump
house of the swimming pool from flooding.

Members sought an update on flooding relief works for Foynes, Askeaton and Ballysteen.

In relation to Foynes, the Operations Manager indicated that following a tender process, Wills
Brothers had been selected as contractors. A letter of intent had issued to Wills Brothers, legal
agreements were being finalised and it was intended that works would be completed by the end
of quarter 3 2016. He noted that the water levels recorded in Foynes on the previous day were
the second highest on record with a high tide of 5.2m accompanied by a higher than predicted
storm surge. He added that sand bags which were recently replaced in Foynes had not been

breached.

The Operations Manager indicated that MHL Consulting Engineers had been appointed to assess
and recommend flood alleviation measures for Askeaton. Design works were ongoing, but no
funding had been allocated for works.

In relation to Ballysteen the Operations Manager informed Members that any funding would have
to await national priorities following the CFRAMS studies by the Office for Public Works (OPW).

Councillor Sheahan noted that insurance companies were refusing to insure properties previously
damaged by flooding or charging exorbitant rates for same. He also noted that some insurance
companies were refusing to insure properties that had not flooded previously but were deemed at

6. Maigue Rivers Trust

The Senior Executive Engineer, Environment gave a presentation on the economic importance of
good water quality and achieving the objectives of the Water Framework Directive in terms of
protecting Ireland's derogation under the Nitrates Directive, avoiding court action and protecting

our "Green Image".

She indicated that the 2nd cycle of the Water Framework Directive runs from 2015 to 2021 and in
this cycle a greater emphasis was placed on developing a bottom up, community led approach to
managing our rivers. Prompted by a serious pollution incident, work on developing this
community based approach began on the River Loobagh in August 2014. Several projects were
undertaken including in-stream works to improve the fish habitat, an education and awareness
programme with schools and tidy towns groups and a study trip to Northern Ireland which led to
the formation of an informal rivers association on the River Loobagh.

She noted that this group identified priority issues, including the control of giant hogweed in the
catchment and an application for funding was made under Local Agenda 21 where €6,000 was
secured to provide training to 10 members of a rural social scheme who would start work to
control the weed in March 2016.

She pointed out that with guidance from Mark Horton, who co-ordinates Rivers Trusts in Northern
Ireland, the group made the decision to form a Rivers Trust on the River Maigue and that
nominations for directorships were currently being sought and it was hoped that the trust would
be in place in the next few months. She indicated that Rivers Trusts were community initiatives
started by local people to care for their local rivers and had environmental charitable status.

Members indicated that every effort should be made to increase salmon stocks and ensure that
sewerage treatment plants were working properly and expressed disappointment at not having
been consulted earlier in the process to establish a Maigue Rivers Trust.

In response to Members queries, the Senior Executive Engineer indicated that it was hoped to
establish a Rivers Trust for the River Deel and Members assistance would be sought in relation to
same.

4. Deputation from Adare United AFC

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Adare United AFC which consisted of John
Carey, Andrew Lohan and Greg Lohan. The representatives thanked the Members for receiving
their deputation. Mr. Lohan informed the Meeting that Adare United AFC had been established in
1937 and he expressed gratitude to the Council for the lease of their grounds at Deerpark Adare.
He outlined the plans for the club which included the development of the pitch and club house
and pointed out that there was a substantial slope of 2m in the pitch which would cost in the
region of €25,000 to resolve. He noted also that damaged fencing around the grounds would cost
€2,500 to repair and that the provision of a cycle path around the pitch would provide a valuable
amenity to the nearby planned Council housing development. The deputation requested the
Council's assistance with the project.

Members thanked the Deputation for their presentation and indicated that they were fully
supportive of the development.

Next District Meeting

it was agreed that the next Meeting would be held on Wednesday, 9" March, 2016 at 9.00 a.m. at
Aras Sean Finn, New Line Road, Rathkeale, Co. Limerick.

5. To consider updates from the Fire Department, the Planning Department
and the Garda Siochana in relation to the Christmas period in Rathkeale.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Superintendent Tom O'Connor and Sergeant Frank O'Sullivan from
Newcastle West District Garda Station to the Meeting and requested to be excused from the
Meeting as he had another engagement. Councillor Sheahan took the Chair at this time.

Superintendent O’Connor outlined to Members the Garda Policing Operation Plan in Rathkeale
from 11" December, 2015 to 11" January, 2016 and provided details in relation to crime statistics
for this period. He also highlighted the challenges encountered by the Gardai during this period
and concerns that arose. He indicated that over this period Gardai monitored the increased level
of traffic in the area, the sale and supply of liquor, the influx of teenagers into the town, some of
whom were driving vehicles dangerously, and the increased level of visitors arising from weddings,
Christenings and a funeral. He also noted the establishment of the Youth Diversion Programme
for Rathkeale/Askeaton. He recommended the installation of CCTV in the town to assist in the
prevention and detection of crime; a review of traffic management and that stakeholders meet in
October 2016 to plan for the Christmas period.

Members thanked Superintendent O’Connor for his update and commended An Garda Siochana
for their excellent work in the Community over the Christmas period. The following points were
raised by various Members during discussion.

e That consideration be given to how other towns dealt with an influx of people during
festivals / holiday periods.

e That a large number of youths, under the age of fifteen, had driven cars in a dangerous
manner around the town and the parents of these youths were then in a position to
recover the vehicle used from the Gardai, having completed the appropriate paper work.
There was a lack of appropriate sanction in these cases and legislation should be enacted
to deal effectively with this issue.

¢ Criticism was expressed that the Catholic Church had allowed 25 weddings to take place in
Rathkeale over the Christmas period. The apparent wealth and assets of a large number of
these visitors was noted and it was suggested that both the Criminal Assets Bureau and the
Revenue Commissioners should investigate the source of this apparent wealth.

¢ The need for effective speed ramps in Askeaton.

Councillor Keary called for a report to be produced showing appropriate locations for speed ramps
in Rathkeale and that the Gardai should be consulted in relation to same. Councillor Sheahan
suggested that pedestrian crossings should be included in such a report.

Councillor Neville noted that considerable investment had been made by the Council in Limerick
City and stressed the need for funding to be made available to upgrade Rathkeale which was the

Askeaton.

The Leas-Chathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Foynes Flying Boat & Maritime Museum
which consistent of Margaret O’Shaughnessy, Director, Foynes Flying Boat & Maritime Museum,
Tadgh Moriarty and Brid Moriarty, Approved Productions.

Ms. O’Shaughnessy thanked the District for its contribution towards the event last year and
indicated that the 2015 Foynes Air Show had attracted 12,000 spectators. She noted that figures
were down due to the very inclement weather conditions, an Air Show in Shannon the previous
week and the tragic death of pilot Howard Cox in a plane crash the previous day. She thanked the
many volunteers, An Garda Siochdna and emergency services for their help and assistance the
previous year.

Ms. O'Shaughnessy pointed out that the Foynes Air Show was planned for Sunday, 17" July, 2016
and that a total of three air shows were planned for the whole country, with two air shows
planned for southern Ireland in Foynes and Bray. She indicated that the Air Show for 2016 would

cost approximately €120,000.

Members indicated that they had enjoyed the 2015 Foynes Air Show and that the event should be
funded by the full Council, and not solely the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, as it was an
event that drew visitors from every part of Ireland. Members expressed disappointment that this
had not been agreed by full Council.

9. Flooding Issues

To receive update on proposals to address the fl ng issues in Foynes, Askeaton and

Ballysteen.

It was noted that this item was discussed at the commencement of the Meeting.

10. Sewerage Treatment Plant in Askeaton

Members noted that positive progress was being made on this project.

11. Footpaths in Adare

To receive update on request to provide footpaths from Adare village to the
GAA grounds in Adare.

The Operations Manager, South and West Division indicated that the existing road width would
not cater for the provision of a footpath. He stated that the requirement of a 1.2m footpath
would lead to the roadway being reduces to one way traffic, therefore, the inclusion of a footpath
would require the removal of the hedgerow and works would involve negotiation with landowners
along the route. He added that approximate costings for the works were in the region of €400,000
to €500,000 and currently the Council has no funding for this project.

Members indicated that these works could be provided in conjunction with the Proposed N21
Adare Western Approach Improvement Scheme.

Correspondence was noted.

The following items were discussed at the conclusion of the Agenda with the consent of the
Cathaoirleach.

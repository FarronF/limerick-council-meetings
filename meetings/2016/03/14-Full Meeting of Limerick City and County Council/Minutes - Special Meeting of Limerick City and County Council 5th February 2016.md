The Mayor thanked those in attendance for attending the Special Meeting

which was being held in order to pass a Vote of Sympathy for Sir Terry Wogan

who had passed away. Deep sympathy was expressed to his family and friends

and, indeed, the wider community on their great loss. Sir Terry Wogan

received the honour of Freedom of Limerick in 2007 and held a unique position

in the hearts of people from both Ireland and the UK as a person of honour

and integrity and was considered by many as an unofficial ambassador from

Ireland to the UK.

Mayor Galvin pointed out that he had opened a Book of Condolence on the

Monday and it was his intention to travel to England to the funeral to

represent the people of Limerick.

Councillor Leddin pointed out that he had been Mayor of Limerick City when

the honour of the Freedom of the City of Limerick was conferred on Sir Terry

Wogan and it was with a deep sense of sadness that he had heard of his death.

He spoke of the important part played by Sir Terry Wogan in broadcasting

throughout the years and of the charm, wit and humour for which he was well

known and highly regarded. Even though he had been living in England for

many years, he had never forgotten his roots in Limerick. He was born on the

Ennis Road and his family had a shop in the city and, throughout the years, he

had been to the forefront of the promotion of the city on very many occasions,

which was extremely important to the city and its people over the years.

Other Members referred to the unique bond he had with Limerick and Ireland

and referred to his rise through the ranks of broadcasting to the highest levels

in the BBC. It was pointed out that he was an iconic figure in broadcasting

where he was a household name throughout Britain and Ireland with a huge

listenership from a very loyal audience.

Members referred to the numerous tributes that had been paid to him from

people all over the world and to the tremendous work done by him up to his

death in respect of various charities and, in particular, the ‘Children in Need.’

It was pointed out that he had been Guest of Honour at the Mayor’s Charity

Ball in 2012 where he had received a tremendous reception from all those

present. He was very proud of being honoured with the Freedom of Limerick

and never missed an opportunity to promote his native Limerick and always

gave generously and freely of his time when asked to talk about his home city.

The Deputy Chief Executive joined with the Members, on his own behalf and

on behalf of the staff, in paying tribute to Sir Terry Wogan. He referred to his

upbringing in Limerick and to his father’s grocery shop which was located on

the corner of Shannon Street and O’Connell Street.

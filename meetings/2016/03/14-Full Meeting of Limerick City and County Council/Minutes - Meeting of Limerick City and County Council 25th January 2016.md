Limerick e-parking

The Senior Executive Technician, Service Operations, gave a presentation on e-

Limited on behalf of Limerick City and County Council. He explained that e-parking was a

one-stop shop window displaying the parking offering available in Limerick City and County.
---

He stated that e-parking enabled users to quickly and conveniently locate, purchase

and book on-street or off-street parking in Limerick City and the principal County towns of

Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock and Newcastle West. He pointed out that users could pay for their

parking by (a) calling a local number (b) downloading the Free Limerick e-parking app from

limerickparking.ie (c) visiting the limerickparking.ie.

He added that pay-by-phone parking in Limerick was first introduced in 2006 and

that Limerick was one of the first cities in Ireland to introduce the park-by-phone

technology. The new rebranded Limerick e-parking service was launched on 12th November,

2015, and 17,000 registered customers had successfully moved to the new Limerick e-

parking system.

duration of 1.05 hours.

The current parking payment profile was 65% disc parking and 35% e-parking. The

goal for Limerick e-parking 2016 was to grow it to over 50%. The e-parking marketing

mediums:

• Digital – app.

Compassionate Communities Project

The Mayor welcomed Dr. Kathleen McLoughlin, from Milford Care Centre and

Maynooth University, to the Meeting.
---
12

Dr. McLoughlin commenced by outlining how Limerick could become the first city in

Ireland to gain the Compassionate City Status. She said that death, dying and loss were

universal experiences. She explained that, in Ireland, approximately 28,000 – 30,000 people

die every year and that 80% of those die following a period of chronic illness. For every

death that took place, it had been estimated that up to 10 other people had been affected,

that was potentially 280,000 people in Ireland every year. She added that most people who

were living with advanced life-limiting illnesses spent their time at home and in their

communities and neighbourhoods, with families, relatives, friends and work colleagues. The

majority of people affected by advanced illness wanted to be cared for, and to die, at home.

However, nationally, only one in four would achieve that wish.

Dr. McLoughlin went on to state that the issues of death and dying affected

everyone but that there was not adequate resources to support people. She said that Irish

rituals around death were good but that there was not enough time and space to grieve

afterwards. The Compassionate Communities Project would try to address this imbalance

and would aim to support people who were facing death or who were experiencing grief

and loss.

Dr. McLoughlin delivered a PowerPoint presentation under the following headings:

• What is the Compassionate Communities Project.

• Care Orders from Britain and Europe.

• Study Protocol.

• Compassionate Cities Charter.

• What does it mean for Limerick.

Dr. McLoughlin explained that the Compassionate Communities Project was an

initiative of Milford Care Centre. The project would support people across the whole of the

Mid-West. She added that a small change in attitude towards death could make a big

difference to how we live. She said the costs associated with the project would be low and

that Milford Care Centre would assign two workers to same.

She thanked the Mayor, Management and Members for giving her the opportunity

to address the Meeting and putting forward the proposal to the Council for consideration.

She concluded her presentation by highlighting the following:

• What was expected from the Council.

• What Milford would do to support the process.

• Next Steps – Public Meeting and raising awareness.

• Setting up of a number of Action Groups and drawing up Action Plan.

• Official Launch.

• Work Programme.

• Forward Recognition.

Proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J);

Seconded by Councillor Byrne;

And Resolved:
---
13

“That, the Council would support the proposal for Limerick to develop a

Compassionate City Charter.”

Dr. McLoughlin thanked the Members for the opportunity to address the Meeting

and then withdrew.

Councillor Keary, in seconding the Motion, stated that local representatives were

very concerned regarding the whole operation of a gasification plant at Gortadroma.

Following considerable discussion, it was agreed that a Special Meeting would be the

best forum to explore the position regarding the proposed plant at Gortadroma. It was

further agreed that there would be a legal representative at the Special Meeting and that it

would be held “in committee.”

Further discussion ensued during which Councillor Prendiville proposed the following

Motion:

“That, the Council write to Cadence EnviroPower requesting that they voluntarily

agree to step back from their conditional lease and scrap it to allow for a full public

consultation before the Council votes on it again.”

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.

In response, the Chief Executive stated that it would be inappropriate for the Council

to correspond with Cadence EnviroPower as proposed by Councillor Prendiville until such

time as legal advice had been sought.

At this point, on the proposal of Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, seconded by Councillor Browne,

it was agreed to take a 15 minute adjournment in order to discuss the matter further and to

seek legal clarification on the proposed Motion. On resumption, the Meetings

Administrator stated that the legal advice regarding the Motion was that it could not be

tabled.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt

with:

11.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary

I will ask at the next Meeting for the following details to be provided in relation to burial

grounds in Limerick: (a) The total number of graves sold by burial ground in 2015, and the

total amount raised by the Council; (b) The total number of graves opened in 2015 by

burial ground; (c) The total number of requests for approvals for headstones and

surrounds submitted by cemetery to Limerick City and County Council in 2015; (d) The

total number of requests for headstones and surrounds granted and refused by burial

ground for 2015; (e) The total number of graves where permission was refused for specific

headstones and surrounds but where the headstone and surround was still erected; (f) The

total number of proceedings by graveyard which Limerick City and County Council has

taken since 2011 in relation to unauthorised headstones and surrounds, and the total cost

to the Council of same.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council sold approximately 505 gravespaces in

2015, raising €400,780 for this period. This is broken down as follows:

• 72 gravespaces were sold in Mount St. Oliver Cemetery, giving an income

of €55,880.

• 135 gravespaces were sold in Castlemungret Cemetery, with an income of

approx. €107,900.

• 298 gravespaces were sold in all other cemeteries throughout County

Limerick, raising €237,000.

Limerick City and County Council received 266 headstone applications in

2015. All the headstone applications received were granted with the

exception of three. The applicants whereby headstones were refused were

requested to re-submit their applications again based on the requirements of

the Cemeteries Bye-Laws.

The Council has not initiated legal proceedings against any monumental

sculptors since 2011. The Cemeteries Bye-Laws require that monumental

sculptors operating in Council cemeteries register with the Council and

comply with its bye-laws. There is provision in the bye-laws whereby

monumental sculptors can be removed from the Council’s Register of

Monumental Sculptors.
---
16

In this regard, the Council has met with three monumental sculptors

regarding non-compliance with its bye-laws in 2015. If there is a second

breach of the bye-laws by Monumental Sculptors, the Council will arrange to

remove these Monumental Sculptors from its list and they will not be able to

carry out works in Council cemeteries.

12.

I will ask at the next Meeting how many people presented as homeless in Limerick in 2014

935 individuals. In 2015, there were 1,035 presentations, which accounted

Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller

I will ask at the next Meeting were there any personal injury claims made against the

Council in the last five years due to the poor state of the Council footpaths and, if so, what

was the total cost to the Council.
---
17

REPLY:

A large proportion of the personal injury claims received by Limerick City and

County Council arise from trips and falls on the footpaths, particularly in

urban areas. Liability for a certain number of these claims will, following

investigation, be passed to a Third Party, e.g. Irish Water, Bord Gáis

Networks, Eircom, etc.

There is no direct cost to the Council as cover for these claims is provided

under the Council’s Public Liability Policy. Ground-up cover for all claims

received by this Authority is in place since January 2013.

The public liability policy premium for 2016 has increased by an average of

6%. This is in line with the increase in premiums across the insurance

industry nationally.

15.

Question submitted by Councillor P. Keller

I will ask at the next Meeting how many people on invalidity pension and blind pension

would not be eligible for a bin waiver for this year.

REPLY:

The Council has requested this information from the Department of Social

Protection and will provide same as soon as it is received.

16.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins

I will ask at the next Meeting which properties or sites are being considered by Limerick City

and County Council in response to the need to provide accommodation to incoming refugees.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council is working closely with the Department of

Justice and Equality Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration. A

Resettlement Interagency Working Group has been set and has met on two

occasions. No decisions have been made with regard to properties or sites.

NOTICES OF MOTION

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

I will move at the next Meeting that Management introduce a scheme that will attract

ratepayers, who have legacy arrears that predate 31/12/2014, to engage with the Finance

Department to put in place a payment plan that will clear the said same arrears.

Suspension of Standing Orders: In the course of discussion on this item, it was noted

that the time was approaching 5.30 p.m. and on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J),

seconded by Councillor Collins (M), Standing Orders were suspended in order to complete

the Agenda.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor

Collins (M).
---
18

REPLY:

The level of arrears at 31st December, 2015, will be approximately €21.47m.

This will be a reduction of 14% on the arrears figure at 31st December, 2014.

This will result in a collection rate of 71% , an increase of 6% on 2014.

A full end-of-year review has been carried out for all commercial rate arrears

at 31st December, 2015. A significant number of the Council’s customers are

now on payment plans which are designed to clear the current year rates and

also reducing opening arrears. The Council will continue to initiate legal

proceedings in cases where no progress is being made in recovering the

arrears due.

Based on the information from the end-of-year reviews, Management will

revert to Council with a proposal to continue to reduce the level of arrears.

A short discussion took place on the Motion. The A/Head of Finance stated that

there had been a considerable effort put in as part of the end-of-year reviews and that he

anticipated that there would be a €1.2m reduction in 2016. He agreed to submit proposals

to reduce the level of arrears at the March Meeting.

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Galvin, Browne, Collins

(M), Foley, Scanlan, Sheahan (J)

We will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Government to introduce a

Tax Incentive Scheme to encourage people to live in rural towns and villages.

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, stated that he was in favour of a scheme

which would encourage people back into towns and villages and which would halt rural

decline. He added that it would also help provide housing for local authorities while at the

same time improving the appearance of the County streets.

Councillor Sheahan (J) seconded the Motion and pointed out that many of the

premises in towns and villages were not conducive to families or as starter homes. He said

that a tax incentive was needed to help renovate these premises to make them more

suitable for families.

The Motion was agreed and it was also agreed to refer it to the Economic

Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee for discussion.

19.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Quinlivan (to be referred

to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee)

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council extends the Bin Waiver to those on

invalidity pension.
---
19

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Quinlivan stated that he felt that those on

invalidity pension should be included in the bin waiver scheme and should be treated in a

similar manner to those on disability allowance who were in receipt of the waiver.

The Motion was seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville (to be

referred to Environment Strategic Policy Committee)

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council undertake to restore the bin waiver to

those on invalidity pension and blind pension, to bring them on par with those on

disability allowance who are in receipt of the waiver.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Prendiville stated that he felt that those on

invalidity pension and blind pension were being treated unfairly and that they should be

dealt with in a similar manner to those on disability allowance who were in receipt of the

waiver. He requested that emergency funding be allocated to fund this initiative.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Keller

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to Irish Water requesting that they

publish the figure for how many people paid the third water bill.

The Motion was adopted, on the proposal of Councillor Keller, seconded by

Councillor Prendiville.

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council request the

Ministers responsible, namely Finance & Agriculture, to legislate for the immediate

reintroduction of the Early Retirement and Farm Installation Schemes so as to ensure

viability and continuity within this valuable sector of our local economy. I am also

requesting that we seek the support of Councils nationwide with Farming Interests.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan outlined the importance of young

farmers being in a position to take over farms in the interest of the continuity of this

valuable sector of the local economy.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J) and agreed.

It was also agreed to circulate the Motion to all Local Authorities for support.

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors E. O’Brien, K. Sheahan, T.

Neville, S. Keary, R. O’Donoghue, C. McMahon

We, the Members of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, call on the Council to

provide continued funding for the successful Airshow on the Shannon Estuary promoted by

the Foynes Flying Boat Museum.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Brien stated that Council support should be

given to this very successful Airshow which was promoted by Foynes Flying Boat Museum.

This would enhance tourism in the area.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (K).

REPLY:

Specific budgetary provision for the Airshow on the Shannon Estuary

promoted by the Foynes Flying Boat Museum has not been provided in the

Council’s Annual Budget 2016. To ensure that the Council has a balanced

revenue account, it is not possible at this time to provide funding towards

this project.

24.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors R. O’Donoghue, K.

Sheahan, E. O’Brien, T. Neville, S. Keary, C. McMahon

We, the Members of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, call on the Council to

continue to supply full funding for the Adare and Croom Public Parks through central

budget as heretofore.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donoghue called on the Council to fully fund

the ongoing maintenance of the Public Parks at Adare and Croom from the main Council

budget and not from the General Municipal Allocation.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (K).

REPLY:

A specific budgetary provision to fund maintenance of Adare and Croom

Town Parks was not made in Budget 2016. An amount of €40,000 has been

provided in Budget 2016 for Parks, Pitches and Playgrounds, part of the GMA

allocation for the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale.

25.

Meeting and stated that the Special Meeting had been called on foot of his Notice of Motion

at the January Meeting of the Full Council. He added that it had been agreed at that

Meeting that a Special Meeting would be the best forum to explore the implications of a

gasification plant and also that a legal representative would be in attendance. Councillor

Sheahan (J) explained that the Party Leaders had been circulated that morning with the

“Report on the Lease of Lands at Gortadroma Volume 1.” He said that a frank and open

discussion had taken place at the Party Leaders’ Meeting in relation to the report but that

further time was required to consider the report.

At this point, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Collins (M),

it was agreed to adjourn for twenty minutes.

On resumption, the Mayor stated that the format that the Meeting would take had been

agreed by the Party Leaders. He said that it had been agreed that the “Report on the Lease

of Lands at Gortadroma Volume 1” would be read into the Minutes of the Meeting. He

explained that there were five Sections in the said report and that each Section would be

dealt with individually. He pointed out that the Director, Transportation and

Travel/Environment, would read each Section and that the Members would be afforded an

opportunity to ask questions/seek clarifications at the end of each Section.

Before calling on the Director to read the report, the Mayor welcomed Messrs. W.E. Leahy

and W. Leahy of Leahy & Partners, Solicitors, and Mr. Gareth McElhinney, Technical

Director, RPS, to the Meeting.

At this stage, copy of “Report on the Lease of Lands at Gortadroma Volume 1” was

circulated to the Members by the Senior Executive Engineer, Environment.

The Director, Transportation & Travel/Environment, confirmed that the Appendices listed in

Volume 2 would be circulated to the Members in the following 2-3 days.

The Director then proceeded to read into the Minutes of the Meeting Section 1, comprising

of Pages 3-4 of the circulated report, as follows:

**Section 1**

**Introduction**

The Gortadroma landfill facility began operating in 1990 and was owned and operated by

Limerick County Council.The facilitycurrently holds a Waste Licence granted by the

Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for the acceptance of both a **130,000 tonnes** of

municipal waste and **30,000** tonnes of inert waste per annum. The site is comprised of **76 ha**

**(188 acres)** of which **18ha (44.5 acres**) (24% of site) is occupied by engineered landfill cells

(which are fully lined chambers designed to manage any leachate or gas arising from the

waste as it decays).

The Council developed and filled 16 cells in total and the last of these was filled in and then

sealed in the summer of 2014.

The site no longer accepts waste for disposal although the public may still bring small

quantities of waste to the site. This waste is subsequently collected under contract and then

transferred elsewhere for treatment or disposal.

There is planning permission and an EPA licence for a further 2 Cells. These proposed

further cells have not been developed due to the uncertainty in the market place for waste

disposal and doubts over the financial viability of a new cell development. The EPA has also

issued a licence in respect of another area within the site for an additional six cells.

However, this area does not currently hold a planning permission. The planning permission

and waste licence in situ represent a substantial asset owned by the Council.

The landfill site also includes a gas collection system and turbine to generate electricity

which is currently supplying to the grid. The turbine is generating 1 Megawatt of electricity,

equivalent to the electrical supply requirement for 700 households. This facility earns a

considerable annual income for the Council.

**Landfill Gate Fees**

Landfill gate fees (income from accepting waste) began to drop drastically in 2009 as a

result of significant landfill capacity being available in the market place and the willingness of

collectors to travel significant distances to deposit their waste. It should be borne in mind that

in the period during which the facility continued to accept waste for landfill the Council

generated a high level of income well in excess of operating costs. Over the lifespan of the

facility the net income earned for the Council amounted to many millions. The projected

decline in this income was an important factor that influenced the need to consider future

options for the use of this major infrastructural asset of the Council.

In 2009 the Council decided to reduce the gate fee at Gortadroma Landfill in line with market

forces and managed to maintain a reasonably significant volume of activity over its last three

years of operation. However, the option of operating the landfill at the reduced gate fees

necessary to ensure a supply of waste ultimately proved uneconomic to the Council. The

reduced gate fees resulted in the closure of all of the landfills in the Southern Region of

Ireland with waste now mainly being exported to mainland Europe for recovery in thermal

treatment plants.

**Pressures on Landfill**

The pressure on the landfill market increased due to the restraints on the types of waste that

could be accepted in the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) and the objectives of the Waste

Framework Directive 2008 (2008/98/EC) to move away from landfill.

The national framework policy produced by the Department of Environment, Community and

Local Government details specific objectives including reducing the dependence on Landfill.

A key stated policy objective in the latest National Policy named “*A Resource Opportunity –*

*Waste Management Policy in Ireland (2012),” is* the virtual elimination of land filling of

municipal waste.

The national policy is also incorporated into Council Policy through the Regional Waste

Management Plans namely the Limerick/Clare/Kerry Region 2006-2011 and the Southern

Region Waste management Plan 2015 – 2021.

The landfill levy forms part of this strategy and currently stands at €75/tonne for any

municipal waste accepted at a landfill for disposal. This landfill levy has proven a very

effective method in diverting waste from landfills. It should be noted that waste used for

energy does not attract the landfill levy. It was apparent to the Council that maintaining the

landfill gate fees at low prices to compete against recycling or waste recovery was not a long

term viable financial option.

The EPA amended the waste licence in June, 2010 which imposed further restrictions on the

Gortadroma Landfill. These restrictions included limiting the organic content of the waste that

could be accepted. Limiting this organic waste fraction, which is also described as

Biodegradable Municipal Waste (BMW), had the effect of requiring waste collectors to pre-

treat or source segregate the waste to remove the organic fraction. Pre-treating adds further

costs to waste that goes to landfill.

The introduction of 2 and 3 bin collection systems for householders is an extension of this

national policy to divert waste from landfill and to encourage recycling.

A decision to extend the life of the Landfill and commit capital to build new cells was not

considered viable given the market and regulatory restrictions.
---
4

In summary, the increased competition in the market for waste, the rise in the cost of the

landfill levy, the statutory compliance requirements all combined to limit the future viability of

Gortadroma as a landfill.

The Mayor then invited Members to indicate if they wished to ask questions/seek

clarifications in relation to Section 1.

Following a short discussion, it was agreed that there was a merit in reading the full report

to the Members at the Meeting and for recording it in full in the Minutes. Some Members

stated that they felt it was important for them to be provided with information on the

historical background to the site.

In response to a query from the Members, the Director, Transportation &

Travel/Environment, confirmed that the report, as circulated, was a public document.

Following requests from the Members, it was agreed that Volume 2 of the report would be

circulated to the Members imminently.

The Director, Transportation & Travel/Environment, then proceeded to read into the

Minutes of the Meeting Section 2, comprising of Pages 5-12 of the circulated report, as

follows:

**Section 2**

**Market Sounding Exercise & Proposed Sale of Gortadroma**

**Landfill**

Limerick County Council commenced a review of the future use of the Gortadroma site in

2010.

At the Special Meeting of the Council held on 26th March 2010, the status of the landfill was

brought to the attention of the full Council. A presentation given to the CPG earlier the same

day (see Appendix A) was also given to the Council. The presentation outlined the options

available to the Council. These options were as follows:-

•

Continue to operate with new cell development

•

Close the landfill

•

Lease/sell the Landfill

•

Add value to the landfill

•

A combination of any of the above.

The Elected Members approved the recommendation to proceed with a market sounding

with a view to engaging with the private sector to secure either the disposal of the site or

identifying some other possible partnership arrangement.

On foot of the Elected Members approval, the Council engaged a leading firm of Irish

Environmental Consultants, RPS, to undertake the Market Sounding Exercise on behalf of

the Council.
---
5

RPS prepared a notice in the EU journal in May, 2010 and then reported on the response of

the Market Sounding. This report indicated that the outright sale of the landfill facility

represented a viable option for the Council. This recommendation was communicated to all

the Members by the Director of Service for Environment on the 23rd June, 2010, (see

Appendix B).

This option of disposal then became the preferred option for the Council as full disposal had

the potential to eliminate the financial risks to the Council associated with the long-term

operation and aftercare of the landfill. This disposal option would have involved Council

divesting itself of the following:

•

Ownership,

•

Operation activities and associated costs,

•

Environmental & commercial risks including existing and contingent liabilities.

The Council conducted a competitive tender process on E-tenders on 27thJuly, 2010 and

appointed RPS Consulting Engineers in partnership with a specialist environmental legal firm

of Matheson Ormsby Prentice on the 5th Oct, 2010 to progress the disposal option on its

behalf.

The sale process was commenced with advertisements in appropriate media and a number

of interested parties expressed an initial interest. The Council engaged in further discussions

with these interested parties. However following an assessment of the bids by the RPS team

a satisfactory offer was not received and the sale process was then terminated on the 11th

July, 2011. The principal reason for failure of the sale was that the sale required a bidder to

accept the historic environmental liability for the Landfill and this provision was ultimately

unacceptable to the bidders.

A further presentation was given to the full council on the 24th October, 2011. (see Appendix

C). The presentation informed the members that the sale process had been unsuccessful

and was officially closed.

The presentation concluded with the following 3 possible options –

(i)

Development of new cells at a cost of €4m/€5m. This option was not recommended

as even if loan sanction could be obtained, the current gate fees would not meet the

loan charges in addition to the other operating costs.

(ii)

Based on the waste intake during 2011, it was anticipated at that time that the

existing cells would be full by early 2013.

(iii)

It was possible in the meantime to seek to establish a potential use for the site as an

alternative treatment option for waste or as an alternative energy option.

In conclusion the date of closure of the landfill was anticipated as 2013 based on the current

intake of waste.

**Alternate Waste Management Technologies at Gortadroma**

**Landfill**

As a follow-up to the market sounding, a number of interested parties approached the

Council during 2012 proposing alternate waste treatment options that could be sited at

Gortadroma Landfill.
---
6

These inquiries reflected the continuing development in new waste treatment technologies

as well as the impact of the greatly increased landfill levy and the mandatory landfill

diversion targets.

These approaches included both biological and waste to energy processes for waste. These

parties expressed an interest in entering a lease/contribution agreement with Limerick

County Council. Some of these interested parties also requested that they be allowed to

take-over the gas to energy plant in order to utilise the connection to the national electricity

grid.

At this stage the Council produced an options report into the Future of Gortadroma (see

Appendix D) in July, 2012. This report recommended that the RPS and Matheson Team be

re-engaged to assess the possibility of disposing of the site by way of a lease option. The

original appointment of the RPS and Matheson team included the option of dealing with any

alternative treatment technology proposal in the event of the sale process being

unsuccessful. The technical aspects would be dealt with by RPS Consulting Engineers and

the legal input would be undertaken by the leading commercial and environmental law firm

Matheson Ormsby Prentice.

Limerick County Council then engaged the RPS Team to ensure that the interested parties

were professionally, technically and financially capable of following through with an alternate

development at Gortadroma Landfill.

Alternative development proposals were requested following a negotiated procedure with

advertisement in the EU journal. These submissions were as follows:

•

A mechanical & biological waste treatment process and new landfill cells,

•

A wind turbine,

•

A waste to energy plant using gasification.

•

A waste to energy plant using pyrolysis.

The relevant steps undertaken in the assessment process are as set out hereunder.

**The prequalification and the selection of the preferred bidder**

• **Stage 1 - Pre qualification**.

This process was utilised to pre qualify any expressions of interest on future uses of

Gortadroma Landfill so that only proposals that met the Pre-Qualification criteria for

professional, technical and financial standing would proceed to the second stage.

These pre qualifying expressions of interest were advertised in the EU journal and on E-

tenders on the 1st August, 2012 and called for an expression of interest by the 15th March,

2013. The requirements of the expressions of interest also required the completion of a Pre-

Qualification Questionnaire.

The results of these Pre-Qualification questionnaires were evaluated by the RPS team,

namely F Clifford, G McElhinney and then approved by RPS Director, W Madden. The Pre-

Qualification Questionnaire Assessment Report was issued on 15th July, 2013.

The RPS report recommended that the Council authorised proceeding to the selection of

preferred bidder stage. The above reports are included in Appendix E.
---
7

• **Stage 2 - Selection of Preferred Bidder**

The Council, on the 31st October, 2013 informed each of the parties who had expressed an

interest if they had been short listed. These parties were then invited to make a detailed

technical and financial submission by the closing date of 8th May, 2014.

These bids were evaluated by RPS.

R Staunton, technical engineer of the RPS team produced a technical and financial appraisal

of these Bids which were then reviewed by G McElhinney, technical associate and approved

by Willie Madden, Director in the report called the **Bidder Proposals Assessment Report –**

**Lease of Land and Infrastructure** dated 23rd July, 2014.

In this report, RPS recommended that Cadence Enviropower Ltd. been selected as the

preferred bidder. The above report is included in Appendix F.

• **Stage 3 –The terms of the Lease**.

The specialist legal advisors, Matheson recommended that any lease should be divided into

two parts, with the Council firstly entering into an “**Agreement to Lease**”, subject to

conditions, and secondly, and subject to all conditions having been met, entering into the

formal “**Lease**”.

It was agreed that the Lease would be held in “escrow” by Matheson and only be released

when all the conditions within the Agreement to Lease have been complied with.

The advantage of this approach is that if the pre-conditions in the Agreement to Lease were

not met by Cadence Enviropower Ltd., then the Council would not be required to conclude

the full Lease Agreement.

This arrangement would simplify dealing with any non compliance by Cadence Enviropower

Ltd and ensure the interests of the Council were protected.

In accordance with the procedures of the Council a presentation was given on 9th September

to the Members of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District. The Council then proceeded to

set out for the Members the outcome and recommendation of the Assessment Report to

allow the Members consider and make an informed decision in relation to the future use of

the Gortadroma site, as set out herewith.

It is clear that the Council has considered all potential options arising out of the

openly advertised request for expressions of interest in relation to future uses of the

Landfill. All procedures have been correctly followed and were in accordance with

procurement law.

**Briefing of the Councillors in the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal**

**District**

The Gortadroma Landfill is located within the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District.

The Members for the Adare-Ratkeale Municipal District had a standing item on their agenda

called “Gortadroma Monitoring Report”. The report included information on the waste

accepted, the remaining capacity, operational issues and complaints.

A presentation was given by the Environment Section to the Adare-Rathkeale area meeting

on the 9th Sept, 2014, (see Appendix G). The presentation detailed the bidding process as

outlined above and the proposal of the preferred bidder. The Members considered the

proposal to dispose of the site by way of lease and requested additional details on the

gasification facility. It was agreed by the Members that the proposed disposal of the

Gortadroma site would be further considered at the next District meeting.

The Environment Department provided further information on the nature and the layout of

the proposed gasification plant at the meeting of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District held

on the 7th October, 2014, (see Appendix H). The Members considered that they required

further information to form a definitive opinion on the matter and requested that a delegation

from the preferred bidder, Cadence Enviropower Ltd. be requested to give a detailed

presentation of their proposed development to the Adare- Rathkeale Councillors.

Cadence Enviropower Ltd. gave a presentation detailing their proposals to the Adare-

Rathkeale Municipal District area meeting on 11th November, 2014, (see Appendix I).

The Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District Councillors requested at their meeting on 13th

January, 2015 that a site visit to a similar gasification facility be arranged in order to allow

them develop a better understanding of the proposal.

At the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District meeting on 10th February, 2015 the Members also

requested that members of the local community should be represented on the visit.

The Council consulted with Cadence Enviropower Ltd who suggested a visit to a plant in

Europe which uses their proposed technology. This facility is located at Morcenx in France.

The Council then coordinated with Cadence Enviropower Ltd on the arrangements for the

requested visit.

The delegation from Limerick included four of the six Adare-Rathkeale Councillors, two local

residents who were also committee members of the local Gortadroma Action group and two

LCCC council staff.

The visit took place on the 11th and 12th March. 2015. The Council delegation were met by

Leonardo Riera, the CEO of Cadence Enviropower and Ron Bailey, the president of PRN

Systems, the company who designed the Gasification System. The two representatives were

available throughout the visit for questions and answers from the delegation in relation to

their proposal.

A site visit report was prepared by the Council and circulated to the Adare-Rathkeale

Councillors on the 13th March, 2015, (see Appendix J).

On the 16th March, 2015 a briefing of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District took place in

Rathkeale. This briefing was given at the request of the Members to discuss the gasification

proposal following the site visit the previous week. It was unanimously agreed by the

Members at that meeting to support the proposal.

It is clear from the above time frame that the proposed disposal of the site by way of a lease

to facilitate the Cadence Enviropower proposal was in the public domain for a period 6 of

months. Subsequent to this period of consideration, the Adare-Rathkeale Members took

their decision to support the proposed disposal at their meeting of the 16th March, 2015.

**Consultation with Local Residents Representatives - The**

**Gortadroma Action Group**

The Gortadroma Action Group was formed in the 90’s and held its first AGM in 1998. It is

made up of representatives of local residents and its function is to discuss issues relating to

the operation of the landfill and to assist in the administration of the Gortadroma landfill

community fund.

For every tonne of waste accepted at the landfill, €1.27 euros (1 Punt), was placed into the

community fund. Projects such as a local group water scheme and a local amenity called the

white river walk were funded this way. The Gortadroma Local Area Development fund

currently contains €686,810

Meetings were held with the Gortadroma Action Group throughout the life of the Landfill. In

the period 2002 to 2009 these meetings were held on average once per quarter. After 2009

the meetings were arranged on an “as required” basis at the request of the Group. The

Council’s Landfill Manager continued to provide monthly reports to the Secretary of the

Gortadroma Action Group up to the closure of the landfill.

On 10th April, 2014 five members of the Gortadroma Action Group met with the Council.

They members of the Action Group were aware of the impending closure of the landfill as

the proposed closure had been advertised and they wished to discuss the implications of the

closure for the site and area.

They were informed that the council was exploring future options for the landfill and were

advised by Council that they had received bids including options for a wind turbine,

mechanical & biological treatment and waste to energy proposals. The Action Group

members were advised that they would be informed if the Council intended to proceed with

any of the options.

Following on from the April meeting with the Gortadroma Action Group, a presentation was

given by the Environment Section to representatives of the Group on 8th December, 2014.

This presentation was the same as that given to the Adare-Rathkeale Councillors on the 9th

September, 2014 and it outlined the proposals of the preferred bidder, Cadence

Enviropower.

At the request of the Adare-Rathkeale Councillors that local residents be included in the

delegation to the site visit to France, the Council contacted the Gortadroma Action Group.

The Group nominated two representatives who both live in close proximity to the Landfill.

The two residents participated fully in the visit and were given the opportunity to ask

questions of Cadence Enviropower about their proposal during the trip.

It is clear from the above that the Council continued to engage with, communicate and

inform the local resident representative group in relation to these proposals.

The Mayor then invited Members to indicate if they wished to ask questions/seek

clarifications in relation to Section 2.

In response to queries from the Members, the following points were noted:
---
10

• A review of the future use of the Gortadroma site had been commenced by Limerick

County Council in 2010. The preferred option at that time was for the disposal of the

site as full disposal had the potential to eliminate the financial risks to the Council

associated with the long-term operation and aftercare of the site. However, a

satisfactory offer was not received and the sale process was terminated in July 2011.

• In relation to the pre-qualification and the selection of the preferred bidder, it was

stated that pre-qualification questionnaires were assessed by RPS Consulting

Engineers on the basis of leasing of land only. It was confirmed that no risk

assessment was required at that stage and that the future use of the lands was the

sole consideration.

• Cadence EnviroPower Limited were selected as the preferred bidder, full details of

appraisal process were included in report dated 23rd July, 2014, entitled “Bidder

Proposals Assessment Report – Lease of Land and Infrastructure.”

• Based on legal advice received, it was stated that the lease was divided into 2 parts.

The first part involved the Council entering into an “Agreement to Lease,” subject to

conditions. The second part involved the entering into the formal “Lease,” this was

subject to all conditions having been met.

• Legal representatives at the meeting explained that the lease was being held in

“escrow” by the legal team and would only be completed when all the conditions

within the Agreement to Lease had been complied with.

• It was confirmed that all procedures were correctly followed and were in accordance

with procurement law.

• It was pointed out that knowledge of the proposed disposal of the site by way of a

lease to facilitate the Cadence EnviroPower proposal had been in the public domain

for a period of six months. It was important to acknowledge that there had been

extensive newspaper coverage of the proposal.

• Cadence EnviroPower would need to undertake and satisfy a statutory planning and

licensing process prior to any formal decision being made in relation to the proposed

development.

• It was confirmed that no cell would be opened at the landfill for municipal waste.

• It was likely that this application for planning would be referred to An Bord Pleanála,

given the scale of the plant and in accordance with the relevant legislation in relation

to Strategic Infrastructure Development.

• The Agreement to Lease the lands was not a pre-planning process, no indication had

been given as to whether planning would be appropriate.
---
11

• Until such time as all conditions had been met, the lease would not become

operative.

• In response to a request from some Members, it was agreed to contact Cadence

EnviroPower Limited to ascertain if it was possible to release details of the

“Agreement to Lease.”

Councillor Sheahan (J) referred to leaflet which had been produced and circulated and

which highlighted the risks associated with gasification. He held up for those present a copy

of this leaflet. He also made reference to a public meeting which was scheduled to take

place in Shanagolden on 18th February, 2016. He asked what could be done in advance of

this meeting to allay some of the fears of the local residents. He asked if information could

be given to the Residents Against Gasification in our Environment (R.A.G.E.) Committee.

The Chief Executive, in response, clarified the position by reiterating that he had signed an

Agreement to Lease only. He said the lease in this case was divided into two parts, with the

Council firstly entering into an “Agreement to Lease,” subject to conditions, and secondly,

subject to all conditions having been met, entering into the formal lease. He added that this

enabled the company to advance their proposals through the statutory planning process

and licensing requirements with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

He informed the Members that the Agreement to Lease, subject to conditions, had been

signed as a consequence of the majority decision of the Council on 23rd March, 2015. He

emphasised that the disposal of an asset, in this case a lease, was the function of the Elected

Members.

In relation to the public meeting scheduled for 18th February, he confirmed that he had

received an invitation to attend, as did a number of staff in the Council. He confirmed that

he would not be attending and, in addition, that he would not be sending a representative.

He stated that it was his opinion that it would be more beneficial to the process if a small

delegation of the R.A.G.E. Committee could be nominated to attend a meeting with himself

and senior staff of the Council on a date suitable to all. He further stated that this would

provide an opportunity to listen to the concerns of the residents of the area. It would also

provide a forum for council staff to outline factually the process envisaged under the

Agreement to Lease to Cadence EnviroPower.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Mitchell, it was agreed

that the Party Leaders would be invited to attend this meeting, subject to a proviso that no

persons currently running for Dáil Éireann would attend due to the ongoing election

process.

It was also agreed that it would be preferable if this meeting could take place before the

public meeting.

The Director, Transportation & Travel/Environment, then proceeded to read into the

Minutes of the Meeting Section 3, comprising of Pages 13-15 of the circulated report, as

follows:

**Section 3**

**Section 183 Notice to Dispose of Lands at Gortadroma Landfill and**

**the Signing of the Contracts for the Agreement to lease and the**

**Lease**

The disposal of land is a reserved function of the Members of Council.

The manner by which any proposed disposal in considered and agreed is set out in Section

The notice of the proposal to dispose of the site by way of a lease under Section 183 of

the Local Government Act was sent on the 12th March, 2015 to all Council Members

together with the associated report proposing the lease of lands at Gortadroma were

sent with the Agenda for the full council meeting of the 23rd March, 2015. (see Appendix

K).

At the Full Council Meeting on the 23rd March, 2015, (see Appendix L), the following

resolution was proposed by Councillor C McMahon and Seconded by Councillor R

O’Donoghue and Resolved:

*“That the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the disposal of 14*

*hectares of land located within Gortadroma Landfill, Ballyhahill, to Cadence*

*Enviropower Limited, 4 The Crescent, Limerick, for a signing fee of €50,000;*

*when planning permission and waste licence are in place, a rent of €4,000,000*

*per annum is payable; In addition a contribution to a Local Community Fund of*

*€100,000 per annum; the disposal to be by way of Lease Agreement for a period*

*of 30 years following granting of all authorisations.”*

The Chief Executive, subsequent to the passing of the Section 183 notice by the Members

and the payment of the Signing fee by Cadence Enviropower Ltd, signed the “Agreement to

Lease” Documents on the 25th May, 2015.

One copy of the Agreement to Lease was handed to Cadence Enviropower Ltd.

The “Lease” Documents were also signed and passed to Matheson, Dublin to be held in

Escrow, to be released if and when the conditions of the “Agreement to Lease” are complied

with.

The Mayor then invited Members to indicate if they wished to ask questions/seek

clarifications in relation to Section 3.

In response to queries from Members, the following points were noted:
---
14

• The disposal of land was a Reserved Function of the Council and the process

followed was as set out in Section 183 of the Local Government Act, 2001.

• The “Agreement to Lease” was signed by the Chief Executive on 25th May, 2015.

The Director, Transportation & Travel/Environment, then proceeded to read into the

Minutes of the Meeting Section 4, comprising of Pages 16-29 of the circulated report, as

follows:

**Section 4**

**Concerns raised by Members**

Subsequent to the completion by the Chief Executive of the Agreement to Lease, a number

of Members stated that they had developed concerns in relation to the proposed

development at the site, and offered the opinion that issues had arisen in relation to the

accuracy of some of the information they had been given in relation to the proposed

development.

Members offered the opinion that, if these allegations were found to be well founded, it

would have had a material bearing on their decision to support the disposal of the property to

Cadence Enviropower.

**Council meeting of the 21st** **July, 2015**, (see Appendix M),

**Emergency Motion** - Members sought as part of an emergency motion that the executive

would conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of the provisions of the agreement

to lease with a view to establishing options including the question of the termination of the

agreement to lease. The Chief Executive confirmed he would seek legal advice in relation to

the concerns raised by the Members with a view to establishing the options available to the

Council.

The Chief Executive confirmed that he would fully investigate any concerns or allegations

made by the Members, and that he would also consider any documentation submitted by the

Members in support of the allegations.

The Members also sought clarification as to the Planning process that Cadence would be

required to undertake prior to any formal grant or refusal of permission.

**The Following Question was submitted by Councillor J Sheahan to the Council**

**meeting held on Tuesday, 21st** **July 2015.**

***“I will ask at the next meeting, following the signing of the lease with Cadence***

***Enviropower Limited for a gasification plant at Gortadroma, will the planning***

***process be a direct application to Limerick City and County Council, a direct***

***application to An Bord Pleanála or a Part V111 application by the Council.”***

**REPLY**:

This application will be considered in accordance with the relevant

legislation in relation to Strategic Infrastructure Development.

It is a mandatory requirement for a prospective applicant for planning

permission for development listed in the 7th Schedule (see below) to

enter into pre-application consultations with the Board and obtain notice

from the Board stating whether or not the proposed development is

regarded as strategic infrastructure development.

For the purposes of these consultations, the prospective applicant must

supply sufficient information to the Board to enable it to assess the

proposed development in the light of the criteria set out for strategic

infrastructure development.

**Definition of Strategic Infrastructure Development**

The 7th Schedule to the 2000 Act lists the classes of infrastructure

development which, if considered by the Board to be strategic

infrastructure development, require direct application for permission to

the Board instead of the local Planning Authority.

To qualify as strategic infrastructure development, a proposed

development must first come within the scope of one or more of the

classes and comply with the thresholds contained in the 7th Schedule.

In addition, the Board must come to the opinion that the proposed

development, if carried out, would fall within one or more of the following:-

• is of strategic economic or social importance to the State or the

region in which it would be situate,

• would contribute substantially to the fulfilment of any of the objectives

of the National Spatial Strategy or any regional planning guidelines in

respect of the area or areas in which the development would be

situate,

• would have a significant effect on the area of more than one planning

authority.

The opinion is formed by the Board at the conclusion of the planning pre-application

stage.-

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan to the Council meeting held on**

**Tuesday, 21st** **July 2015.**

***“I will move at the next meeting that a Quantitive Risk Assessment be*

*immediately carried out so as to assess the risks or none of the operation of a*

*Gasification Plant at Gortadroma.”***

The following reply was drafted by the planning section.

*“The Council do not have sufficient detail to prepare a quantative risk assessment at this stage and in*

*any event this assessment will be carried out as part of the planning application process.”*

**Legal Advice requested since the signing of the Contract**

Members sought legal advice in relation to a number of issues.

**(A)** **The Following Question was submitted by Councillor J Sheahan to the Council**

**meeting held on Tuesday, 21st** **July 2015.**

“*I will ask at the next meeting if a Section 183 decision can be revoked and, if so, what the*

*procedure is*.”

The Senior Executive Officer, Corporate Services, having regard to the Legal Advice available to the

Council, set out the position in relation to the possibility of revoking a Section 183 Notice as follows:-

“Legal advice was sought in relation to this Question and I set out details of the advice

received hereunder for your attention:

*To deal with this Question, one has to consider Section 183 of the Local Government Act*

*2001, and also paragraph 56 of the Standing Orders of Limerick City & County Council*

*which, collectively, provide as follows:-*

*1) Section 183 deals with the requirements for the proposed disposal of land held by a*

*Local Authority and notes that a disposal for a term of years not exceeding one year*

*does not come under the provisions of this section.*

*2) Section 183 further sets out certain procedural matters connected with the disposal*

*of property, including the giving notice to the Members. The purpose of this notice is*

*to provide the Members with certain information including, inter alia:-*

*(I) The property being disposed*

*(II) The person from whom the property was acquired*

*(III) The person to whom the property is to be disposed*

*(IV) Any covenants or conditions that are to attach to the disposal.*

*(V) The purchase price.*

*3) The Members, having been supplied with the above information, have the opportunity*

*of considering the matter and making a decision as to whether they agree or*

*disagree with the disposal. Naturally, it is open to the Members to raise any issues in*

*respect of which they may need*

*Clarification at that meeting and before a decision is reached. The Members then*

*decide whether to pass the resolution to dispose of the property, or to decide that the*

*disposal shall not be carried out.*

*4) Turning now specifically to paragraph 56 of the Standing Orders, it is important to*

*note that this is worded in such a manner as to afford an opportunity to the Members*

*in certain circumstances to rescind a resolution. If the rescission is to take place*

*within six months of the resolution being passed, the Councillors have to carry out*

*the procedures that are set out in paragraph 56. Notice has to be given of the*

*intention of the Members to rescind a resolution passed within the previous six*

*months and that notice has to have the name of the Member who proposes the*

*Motion, together with the names of five other Members who are supporting the*

*Motion to rescind.*
---
17

*It is important to bear in mind that Standing Orders cannot overrule the existing common law*

*or statutory law. Standing Orders are brought in for the purpose of regulating meetings.*

*There is no doubt that the Council, in the Standing Orders which it has adopted, has given*

*itself a general power to revoke a resolution. However, I must reiterate that such a*

*revocation must not result in any breach of statutory law or common law.*

*Further, where the Council is exercising a quasi-judicial power, such as revoking a Section*

*183 Resolution, this cannot, in my view, be done where there is a binding contract in place.*

*The Members will be acquainted with the number of resolutions that come before it for the*

*disposal of dwelling houses and other properties. The contracts in respect of those*

*properties typically contain a provision that the contract is subject to the passing of a*

*resolution under Section 183 of the 2001 Act.*

*When that resolution is passed, the sale of the property is then completed. There is no*

*question of waiting to see if the resolution is going to be rescinded under the provisions of*

*the Standing Orders. If a binding contract exists, as it would where there is a disposal of*

*houses or other property, then once the resolution is passed, that binding contract becomes*

*enforceable. In those circumstances, it would be very wrong for the Members to rescind a*

*resolution when the purchaser of the property has been advised of the passing of the*

*resolution and a contract exists.*

*One must also be very much aware of the fact that the Councillors have an opportunity,*

*when considering a Section 183 resolution, of either approving of the disposal or rejecting*

*the disposal. That is very significant, because it could be very strongly argued that the*

*Councillors had an opportunity of rejecting the resolution at that particular time. Once that*

*resolution was passed, then the likelihood is that a binding legal contract comes into*

*existence. If that is so, in my view, the resolution under Section 183 of the Local Government*

*Act, 2001, could not be revoked or rescinded on foot of the Standing Orders.*

*Of course, the question may be asked as to why the Members seem to have a revocation*

*power at paragraph 56 of the Standing Orders but are now being advised by me that this*

*cannot apply to decisions made with regards the transfer of property where there is a binding*

*contract. The answer to this is quite simply that, in my view, the power the Councillors have*

*given themselves to revoke is not absolute and must be conditional on the decision not*

*affecting a third party who has acquired a contractual interest.*

*This would differ, for example, where the Members wish to revoke a resolution passed with*

*regards to an item fully within the control of the Local Authority – traffic control, signage etc.*

*In such an instance, it is of course open to the Council to revisit the decision. However,*

*where a third party has, on foot of the passing of a resolution, acquired a contractual*

*interest, I believe that the Councillors do not have the same leeway to revoke.”*

*End of legal Advice*

**(B) The relevance of an unsigned Document received through the Chair of the Adare-**

**Rathkeale Municipal District.**

The Council subsequently received for consideration a document, described as “Briefing

Document, Adare-Rathkeale Councillors”, and dated 23rd October 2015, through the Chair of

the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District. (Appendix N)

The Director of Service, in accordance with a commitment given to the Members, sought

legal advice in relation to the content of this document. The advice received by the Council is

set out hereunder.
---
18

*“I attended a meeting of the Limerick City & County Council on the*

*20**th* *October last when many issues relating to the proposed*

*development of the Gortadroma Site as a Gasification Plant were*

*discussed.*

*At that meeting it was agreed that the Councillors for the*

*Adare/Rathkeale area would provide you with evidence of alleged*

*misrepresentation, or misleading information was provided by*

*representatives of Cadence Enviropower Limited, regarding the*

*proposed development. The Councillors for the Adare/Rathkeale area*

*were to meet to discuss the matter further and agreed to forward to*

*you supporting evidence/documentation in that regard.*

*You received from Councillor Richard O’Donoghue a briefing*

*document dated the 23**rd* *October last. The document was unsigned.*

*I considered this briefing document which is highly technical in nature,*

*with the relevant officials of the City & County Council. Whilst I am*

*not qualified to assess the more technical aspects of the document, I*

*fail to see any evidence in that document that the proposed lessee*

*misled or misrepresented the Council in any way.*

*There are a large number of detailed environmental issues to be*

*considered. There certainly were issues raised in the briefing*

*document relating to detailed environmental matters that still need to*

*be fully assessed and will form part of the statutory requirement for*

*the application to carry out an environmental impact assessment as*

*part of the proposed lessee’s planning and waste licence applications.*

*Yours sincerely,*

***WILLIAM E. LEAHY***

**Chain of e-mails between the 19th** **June, 2015 and 22nd** **October, 2015**

The Members of the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District sought legal advice in relation to the

content of a chain of e-mails between the 19th June, 2015 and 22nd October, 2015 between

Cllr T Neville and Leonardo Riera, CEO of Cadence which were sent via the Council, (See

Appendix O).

The area of concern to the Members was to establish if these emails provide evidence that

the lessee has misled or misrepresented aspects of the proposed development to the

Council.

The Councils legal representative, having reviewed the chain of emails, offered the following

advice.

*“I have considered the correspondence that has passed between*

*Councillor Tom Neville and the Council and also the*

*correspondence that the Council have received from Leonardo A.*

*Riera the Chief Executive of Enviropower Renewal, Inc. The*

*main issue arising out of that correspondence is whether or not*

*the residue from the thermal treatment of solid waste at the*

*Gortadroma facility will be inert or not.*
---
19

*Throughout the correspondence Mr Riera seems to me to be very*

*definite in stating that, all of the solid residue resulting from the*

*processing of waste at Gortadroma will be inert. That appears to*

*have been made very clear in the responses received from the*

*Chief Executive Officer.*

*He does make reference to the disposal of 0.5% of the waste*

*processed and states that would need to be disposed of in a*

*sanitary landfill. Notwithstanding that, he still clarifies in his e-*

*mail of the 29**th* *September 2015 and indeed in other parts of the*

*correspondence, that the waste will all be inert.*

*I cannot see from that correspondence, that it is possible to argue*

*that the Councillors were mislead in regard to the disposal of the*

*solid residue from the Gortadroma facility.*

*Mr Riera in his e-mail of the 1**st* *October states “to summarise; the*

*5% of the 10% referred to in the August 28 letter will be inert*

*materials”.*

*The letter goes on to summarise the type of material comprised at*

*0.5% and the Chief Executive Officer concludes that paragraph*

*by stating:-*

*“again, these are all inert materials”.*

*On the basis of this correspondence it would be very difficult for*

*me to recommend proceedings based on an allegation of*

*misrepresentation by Enviropower.*

*It would appear that if one were to contemplate legal proceedings*

*one would have to be satisfied that there was serious*

*misrepresentation. If the Council was of the view that the*

*correspondence justified legal proceedings, and were to launch*

*same, the Council would in my view be in serious difficulties.*

*Obviously any such proceedings would delay the process and*

*could possibly result in the An Bord Pleanala application, or the*

*application for the licence being stalled. That in itself could well*

*result in Enviropower having a very substantial claim for loss and*

*damages against the Council.*

*There is a lot of case law on misrepresentation and deceit. In a*

*very old case, which is still relied on, the following extract will give*

*you some idea of the complexities of the law in regard to this*

*particular issue. The case was Derry –v- Peak and the following*

*extract is helpful:-*

*“the promoters of a company issued a prospectus stating that*

*they have a licence to use steam power to run a tram. They did*

*not; they expected to get it as a mere formality. They were*

*refused and the company failed. The shareholders sued for*

*deceit. The action failed because it was not proved that the*

*Directors lacked honest belief in what they had said”.*
---
20

*The following extract from an article on “fraud in Ireland” might*

*help to clarify in a small way the difficulties that arise in proving*

*misrepresentation.*

*“deceit arises in circumstances where the defendant causes the*

*plaintiff loss through misleading the plaintiff by means of a fraud*

*(ie with dishonest intent).”*

*This will give you some idea of the hurdles that have to be got*

*over in pursuing a claim of this nature. On the information I have*

*read to date, I am satisfied there is not sufficient, or any evidence*

*to conclude that the Council were mislead, or that there is*

*sufficient*

*grounds*

*to*

*consider*

*bringing*

*proceedings*

*for*

*misrepresentation.*

*If any of the Councillors have any other evidence that I am not*

*aware of, perhaps they would supply it either to the Chief*

*Executive or to me, so that it can be considered further.*

*It is important also to understand that the Lessees in the Lease*

*have to go through the planning process and also obtain a waste*

*licence. That will afford an opportunity to anyone to make*

*objections or representations. The likelihood is there will be an*

*oral hearing and perhaps that is the forum that should be used to*

*formulate grounds to lodge serious objections to the proposed*

*development.*

*You might revert to me if I can be of any further assistance.*

***Yours faithfully,***

***WILLIAM E. LEAHY***

The Council also sought advice from Senior Counsel in relation to a number of the issues

raised by the Members and the content of the advice received is set out hereunder;

**Advice from Senior Counsel,** **JAMES DWYER SC,**

**re: Gortadroma Agreement for Lease**.

I note that I furnished my Opinion in this matter as of October last, which Opinion

related to the possibility of revoking a Resolution made pursuant to Section 183 of

the Local Government Act 2001, as a means of determining an Agreement for Lease

which had been made between Limerick City and County Council and Cadence

Enviropower Limited. It appears that the Council accept that there isn’t really scope

for revoking a Section 183 Resolution, and also they presumably have taken on

board the fact that even if the same was revoked it would not entitle the Lessee to

terminate the Agreement for Lease.

The issue which has now arisen is a more complex issue, and it relates to the

possibility that Limerick City and County Council would seek to argue that they had

been induced to enter the agreement on the basis of a misrepresentation and thus

seek to rescind the same on that basis. It is beyond doubt that the Court will, under

in fairness very limited circumstances, which I will deal with below, grant relief to a

party who had been induced to enter into an agreement by virtue of the
---
21

misrepresentation made by the other contracting party. Such relief is equitable

relief. that means that it is not available save at the discretion of the Court, and

equally the onus of proving misrepresentation rests with the party alleging it, which

in this case would be Limerick City and County Council.

I would say as a preliminary point that insofar as Limerick City and County Council is

concerned one of the biggest issues in this case will inevitably be the fact that the

change of heart on the part of the individual councillors appears to have occurred

subsequent to representations being made by individuals, who presumably live in

the Adare-Rathkeale areas, in relation to the prospect of the erection of the

proposed gasification plant. While clearly it is perfectly legitimate for any County

Council to have regard to the views of voters etc. it does have to be accepted that

the views of the voters while they may influence individual county councillors, it

cannot be seen as a justification for or a reason for seeking to void existing

contractual arrangements. Even in the context of a misrepresentation the Court will

look at all surrounding circumstances, and it does seem to me that the timescale in

the present case, which is essentially the consideration of the possibility of

establishing a gasification plant, which does in fairness have significant financial, if

no other, benefit for Limerick City and County Council, the passing of the 183

Resolution and entering into the Agreement, before in fairness any issues arose as

to the suitability of the project from the point of view of local individuals, is a matter

that will have some significant influence on the Court in considering whether or not

misrepresentation is in fact a realistic prospect.

At its simplest misrepresentation is a statement made by one contracting party to the

other which has the effect of, which may not necessarily be intended, of inducing

that other party to enter into a contract. By definition all contracts would have as

their basis representations made by the contracting parties prior to the contract

being entered into, those representations could relate to any number of factors such

as, for example, an existing fact situation, a future or present intention, or even a

statement as to economic or other factors. A misrepresentation is simply a

representation which is untrue.

There are two types of misrepresentation, there are the misrepresentations which

are innocently made, and there are the misrepresentations which deliberately made.

It is only in the context of a misrepresentation which has been deliberately made that

a contracting party i.e. the other contracting party, is usually entitled to apply to the

Courts for rescission of the contract, the basis of the application for rescission is

clearly that the individual would not have entered into the contract save for the fact

that misrepresentation had been made.

By definition a misrepresentation has to relate to a significant factor in the context of

the contractual relations between the parties, and I would stress this, if rescission is

to be sought the misrepresentation must have been essentially deliberate or at the

very least as a result of significant carelessness on behalf of the person making the

same.

If there is a representation made in all innocence that generally speaking would

entitle a party to damages, where damages had been suffered, but not to rescission

of the contract. Equally it has to be accepted that where there is a deliberate

misrepresentation, which is generally referred to as fraudulent misrepresentation, it

must have had the effect of inducing the party to enter into the contract. For

example, if the contracting party was aware that misrepresentation was false, then

clearly misrepresentation, be it fraudulent or otherwise, did not induce that party to

enter into the contract.
---
22

Insofar as I understand matters the misrepresentation which would be alleged

relates to information that would have been furnished to, I presume, Council officials,

presumably much of the information given was very technical in nature, which I

presume would relate to the environmental and other aspects of the construction of

the gasification plant, and the suitability etc. of same. By definition such information

would be highly specific in nature and quite complex. I note reference is made to

the series of emails between Leonardo Riera, who is the Chief Executive Officer of

Cadence of the one part and Councillor Tom Neville of the other part. It does not

appear on consideration that the information given in these emails is in fact

inaccurate or false, but I have to confess I would have no personal knowledge in that

context.

I would envisage two very practical difficulties in Limerick City and County Council

seeking to argue that there had been a misrepresentation, the first is that it would

have to be established that the information given, if it was technical information, was

significantly incorrect, and by that presumably one would have to accept that the

information given was given in a particular way so as paint a false picture in relation

to the gasification plant, for example, if the levels of pollution generated by same

were significantly understated. Clearly in order to have any relevance the

information given has to have been given in writing, but equally there is an issue as

to who would have been the recipient of the information, in that if the decision is

made by the County Councillors as a whole, then information given to one County

Councillor clearly couldn’t really be said to have influenced others albeit that

presumably third hand information might have been given to them.

It seems to me that it would be very difficult on the basis of technical information

given, unless the same was grievously inaccurate, to seek to argue that there had

been a misrepresentation. Misrepresentation is always difficult to establish, but it

will always be easier to prove a statement to the effect that a second-hand car had

done 50,000 miles, when evidence exists to show that it had done 150,000 miles,

than arguing about the merits or demerits of technical data or scientific information,

in respect of which there may well equally be a variety of viewpoints, and as such it

is quite difficult to establish that the information given was in fact inaccurate, which is

the evidence that would be required.

A significant amount of time and consideration, presumably, went into the issue as

to whether or not the Resolution should be passed and the Agreement for Lease

entered into. The Agreement for the Lease is only the first part in a long process,

and it is the case that the Agreement for Lease contemplates a fairly stringent

planning and environmental process being put in place before the Lease is to be

granted.

I have read the briefing document which was received from the Adare-Rathkeale

Councillors, and quite clearly the same does deal to an extent with technical issues,

it doesn’t seem to me that the same would go anywhere near being sufficient to

establish a basis for seeking to argue that there had been a fraudulent

misrepresentation which had induced Limerick City and County Council to enter into

the Agreement for Lease. At the end of the day that is what is necessary.

Any attempt to seek to set aside the Agreement for Lease will inevitably be heavily

resisted, that means presumably a difficult and complex High Court action, which

presumably would be, given the value of the scheme etc. be dealt with in the

Commercial Court. That would mean that the hearing would take place, if such
---
23

Proceedings were launched, relatively quickly i.e. probably within 12 months, but the

costs of any such action would be very significant.

From the point of view of Limerick City and County Council to contemplate bringing

such an action one would also have to be aware of the fact that in the event that the

action was not successful, and I have to say on the basis of the documentation that

is available to date it seems to me that this is effectively a certainty, insofar as such

things ever are, that would involve therefore two sets of Commercial Court costs, as

well as the potential for damages. It would almost inevitably be acceptable for

Cadence to down tools and not proceed with any application in relation to planning

permission pending the resolution of the Proceedings such as might be brought, that

would result in effectively a 12 months’ delay, which would presumably in itself, if the

action was not successful, give rise to a claim in damages.

Clearly it is in theory possible if there was sufficient evidence that an application to

set aside the Agreement for Lease could be made on the basis of misrepresentation,

it would have to be a fraudulent misrepresentation which essentially would mean a

deliberate misrepresentation which was made so as to induce Limerick City and

County Council to enter into an Agreement for Lease. That would involve having

very clear and certain evidence as to the fact that there were such

misrepresentations, the nature of same and that same were deliberately made, and

that if such evidence was available, and it doesn’t seem to me that it is, then and

only then would it be appropriate to consider the possibility of bringing such an

application.

I trust this clarifies matters, if any further points arise please do not hesitate to

contact me.

Yours sincerely,

**JAMES DWYER SC.**

The Mayor then invited Members to indicate if they wished to ask questions/seek

clarifications in relation to Section 4.

In response to queries from Members, the following points were noted:

• Cadence EnviroPower would be required to make an application to An Bord

Pleanála in accordance with the requirements attached to major

infrastructure proposals. The Council would then have an opportunity to

make a formal submission to An Bord Pleanála as part of the consultation

process and would undertake a Quantitive Risk Assessment to support its

submission in this regard.

• As part of the Council’s application to An Bord Pleanála, a Quantitive Risk

Assessment would be carried out as part of the planning application process.

• It was noted that a significant amount of time and consideration had gone

into the issue as to whether or not the Section 183 resolution should be

passed and the “Agreement to Lease” entered into. The “Agreement to

Lease” was only the first part in a long process, it would be followed with a
---
24

stringent planning and environmental licensing process to be completed

before the Lease could be granted.

• Legal advice in relation to the Section 183 Notice under consideration was

that the Council had entered into a binding contract.

• Legal advice based on information submitted concluded that the proposed

lessees had not misled the Council.

The Director, Transportation & Travel/Environment, then proceeded to read into

the Minutes of the Meeting Section 5, comprising Pages 30-34 of the circulated

report, as follows:

**Section 5**

**Current status of the Agreement to Lease**.

Cadence Enviropower in accordance with clause 3.1.2.3 of the Agreement to Lease

are required to “…use all reasonable endeavours to ensure a planning application is

lodged with the planning authority within 12 months of the date of the Agreement…”

which is 12 months from the 25th May, 2015.

Cadence Enviropower Ltd arranged and held a public information meeting at

Shanagolden Community Hall on the 16th July, 2015.

Cadence Enviropower have appointed a firm of environmental consultants, AWN

consulting, Dublin who commenced work in July 2015. This work included a site

investigation and the preparation of the baseline study as required by clause 10.1 of

the Agreement to Lease. AWN Consulting submitted the report to LCCC on the 31st

December, 2015.

The report stated that the baseline study will form the basis of an EIS scoping report

to be submitted to LCCC, the EPA and to An Bord Pleanala.

Cadence Enviropower has not as yet applied to An Bord Pleanala for a decision

under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006 to secure

clarification as to whether their proposal falls within the classes of development

designated as Strategic Development in the Act. Cadence has stated in the Baseline

Report under Planning Context that it is their intention to seek such a designation.

The decision as to whether the proposed development at Gortadroma constitutes

Strategic Infrastructural Development can only be made by An Bord Pleanala, on

foot of a submission by Cadence Enviropower.

**Termination of Lease**

The principal measures within the Agreement to Lease detailing how the Agreement

to Lease may be terminated are as follows:-

**Conclusions**

The Section 183 resolution passed by the Members in relation to the disposal of land

at Gortadroma has been passed in accordance with the Local Government Act 2001.

The Legal advice available to the Council confirms that, inter alia,

“*Further, where the Council is exercising a quasi-judicial power, such as revoking a*

*Section 183 Resolution, this cannot, in my view, be done where there is a binding*

*contract in place” and, “However, where a third party has, on foot of the passing of a*

*resolution, acquired a contractual interest, I believe that the Councillors do not have*

*the same leeway to revoke.”*

The advice available to the Council in relation to the Section 183 Notice under

consideration in this report is that the Council has entered into a binding contract.

The Council has also had the documentation submitted by the Members,

subsequent to the passing of the Section 183 Notice of Disposal, and also the

completion of the Agreement to Lease, assessed.

The legal advice available to the Council is that the information submitted does not

provide evidence that the proposed lessee misled the Council in any way.

The advice confirms that

*“I fail to see any evidence in that document that the proposed lessee*

*misled or misrepresented the Council in any way.”*

This advice also acknowledged that there are technical aspects of the

proposal which will require further consideration and that the appropriate

time to have these concerns raised and addressed will be during the

application for planning procedure and the application to the EPA for the

required Waste Licence.

*“There certainly were issues raised in the briefing document relating*

*to detailed environmental matters that still need to be fully assessed*

*and will form part of the statutory requirement for the application to*

*carry out an environmental impact assessment as part of the*

*proposed lessee’s planning and waste licence applications.”*

The Legal advice also cautions the Council in relation to initiating proceedings

based on a belief that some aspects of the proposed development were

misrepresented to the Members, unless there is very strong evidence available to

the Council to support such an allegation or case.

*“It would appear, that if one were to contemplate legal*

*proceedings one would have to be satisfied that there was*

*serious misrepresentation. If the Council was of the view that the*

*correspondence justified legal proceedings, and were to launch*

*same, the Council would in my view be in serious difficulties.*

*Obviously any such proceedings would delay the process and*

*could possibly result in the An Bord Pleanala application, or the*

*application for the licence being stalled. That in itself, could well*

*result in Enviropower having a very substantial claim for loss and*

*damages against the Council.”*

The substance of these opinions has been confirmed by the advice from

Senior Counsel.

“*I have read the briefing document which was received from the Adare-Rathkeale*

*Councillors, and quite clearly the same does deal to an extent with technical issues,*

*it doesn’t seem to me that the same* ***would go anywhere near being sufficient to***

***establish*** *a basis for seeking to argue that there had been a fraudulent*

*misrepresentation which had induced Limerick City and County Council to enter into*

*the Agreement for Lease. At the end of the day that is what is necessary.”*

*“From the point of view of Limerick City and County Council to contemplate bringing*

*such an action one would also have to be aware of the fact that in the event that the*

*action was not successful, and* ***I have to say on the basis of the documentation***

***that is available to date it seems to me that this is effectively a certainty,*

*insofar as such things ever are, that would involve therefore two sets of Commercial*

*Court costs, as well as the potential for damages. It would almost inevitably be*

*acceptable for Cadence to down tools and not proceed with any application in*

*relation to planning permission pending the resolution of the Proceedings such as*

*might be brought, that would result in effectively a 12 months’ delay, which would*

*presumably in itself, if the action was not successful, give rise to a claim in*

*damages.”*

A Contract is now in place between Limerick City and County Council and Cadence

Enviropower Ltd. Any attempt to unilaterally withdraw or frustrate this Contract that

would result in Cadence EnviroPower not being able to meet their contractual

obligations would have serious implications. The legal advice available to the

Council confirms that such a development could well result in Cadence EnviroPower

having a very substantial claim for loss and damages against the Council.

The Council must also have regard to the fact that Cadence Enviropower must

undertake and satisfy a statutory planning and licencing process prior to any formal

decision being made in relation to this proposed development.

*“The Agreement for the Lease is only the first part in a long process, and it is the*

*case that the Agreement for Lease contemplates a fairly stringent planning and*

*environmental process being put in place before the Lease is to be granted.”*

In conclusion it is also clear from the legal advice available to the Council that the

financial and reputational damage that is likely to impact on the Council should it

decide to undertake any action to disengage or frustrate this Contract would be

substantial.

The Mayor then invited Members to indicate if they wished to ask questions/seek

clarifications in relation to Section 5.

In response to queries from Members, the following points were noted:

• Cadence EnviroPower, in accordance with Clause 3.1.2.3 of the “Agreement

to Lease” were required to “...........use all reasonable endeavours to ensure

a planning application is lodged with the Planning Authority within 12

months of the date of the Agreement.....,” which was 12 months from 25th

May, 2015.

• It was confirmed that Cadence EnviroPower had not as yet applied to An

Bord Pleanála for a decision under the Planning and Development (Strategic

Infrastructure) Act, 2006.

• The decision as to whether the proposed development at Gortadroma would

constitute Strategic Infrastructural Development could only be made by An

Bord Pleanála on foot of a submission by Cadence EnviroPower.

• A contract was now in place between Limerick City and County Council and

Cadence EnviroPower Limited. Any attempt to unilaterally withdraw or

frustrate this contract that would result in Cadence EnviroPower Limited not

being able to meet their contractual obligations would have serious financial

and reputational implications. Legal advice available confirmed that such a

development could well result in Cadence EnviroPower having a very

substantial claim for loss and damages against the Council.

This concluded the Meeting.

He concluded by pointing out that Limerick had many areas built at a level that put them

at risk of either fluvial or tidal flooding. He stated that flooding was not a new problem

and that heavy rainfall and storms were becoming more frequent and that global warming

and rising sea levels were a reality. He added that Limerick was at risk from fluvial and

tidal flooding but that the greatest risk was probably tidal. The Council needed to be

more selective when deciding where to locate developments. Improved flood

infrastructure was required which would take time and would be costly.

The Mayor and Members complimented the Director and the Senior Engineer for their

very comprehensive presentation. They expressed their appreciation for the whole

organisation of the flood relief response in what were very difficult circumstances. They

thanked all members of staff and other organisations who had been involved in the

endeavours to minimise the impact of flooding.

It was stated that the Special Meeting had been called to discuss recent flooding and the

plans that should be put in place to alleviate hardship and financial loss for affected land

and property owners. Solidarity with those affected nationally and locally needed to be

demonstrated.

It was proposed by Councillor Collins (M) that the Council call on the Minister for

Transport, Tourism and Sport to make emergency funding available to Limerick

City and County Council for immediate repairs to the Council’s roads that had been

damaged by recent flooding. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Foley and

agreed.

The Mayor, with the Members’ consent, moved the following Motion:

“That, the Council call on the Government to amalgamate all the agencies involved

in waterways in the country into one agency and to allow farmers, landowners,

property owners to undertake dredging of their rivers at appropriate times of the

year.”

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Hourigan and agreed.

The Mayor also requested that information be provided in relation to number of State

Agencies with responsibility for rivers, lakes, streams (waterways) in the City and County

of Limerick.

The Chief Executive, in response to queries raised by Members, stated that there had

been serious underfunding of the roads programme nationally over the previous number

of years. An estimate of the recent damage to the roads infrastructure would be prepared

and submitted to the Department.

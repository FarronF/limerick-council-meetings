**Economic Development and Planning**

**Proposed Amendment No. 2 to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011-2017 in relation to**

**Mungret - Loughmore Area**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Economic Development and Planning dated 20th January,

2016 enclosing the Chief Executive's Report to Members dated 20th January 2016 prepared in

accordance with Section 20(3)(c) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) in

relation to proposed Amendment No. 2 to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011 – 2017

Mungret – Loughmore Area.

At the outset Councillor Byrne put forward the following motion which was seconded by

Councillor Butler :-

“That the following change shall be made to Objective ML015(B), Point 4 :

Remove the text “With the exception of the development of the main block in Mungret

College”. Point 4 shall therefore state the following:

Community Uses: Within the Mungret College Hub community uses should be prioritised. No

new development shall take place within the Mungret Neighbourhood Hub, which is zoned for

mixed use purposes, until such time as the local community facility needs are met within the

hub. The Council will work with local community organisations to facilitate the provision of

community uses in this area.

Reason: To ensure the prioritisation of community facilities at this location. It is considered

that the proposed amendment is in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable

development of the area and will have no impact on the SEA and AA”.

Councillor Collins highlighted the absence of a detailed plan for the development of Mungret

College and his opposition to proposals to change the zoning for Mungret College to Mixed Use,

pending consideration of such a plan.

Councillor Collins proposed the following motion as an amendment to Councillor Byrne’s motion

and this was seconded by Councillor Lynch :-

“Remove the proposed mixed use zoning in Mungret College and revert back to current zoning

and omit objective ML05B and any other reference to mixed use there, throughout the

proposed amendment to the Local Area Plan, until a detailed plan for the College is presented”.

Councillor Butler raised concerns in relation to the zoning of serviced sites in Rathmale and

proposed the following motion which was seconded by Councillor Byrne :-

“I move that lands rezoned as serviced sites in Rathmale be zoned as established residential and

agricultural use as there is sufficient zoned land for housing and that the text in the amendment

document should be changed as necessary. The land zoned as established residential is along

the front of the site as shown on the map submitted (see Appendix 1)”.

Members discussed the appropriate use and zoning of Mungret College going forward and in

response to queries from Members the Senior Executive Planner clarified the rationale behind

the proposed 1.4 hectare mixed use zoning of the Mungret College complexes as follows :-

 The need for a neighbourhood hub to serve the extensive residential zoned lands planned in

the vicinity of the complex.

 That this neighbourhood hub should, according to national planning guidelines, be a lively

centre with activity and passive surveillance during night and day which essentially involved

having a residential component as part of it.

 That existing zoning was too restrictive.

The Senior Executive Planner also indicated that there were adequate conditions in the wording

of the original proposed amendment to ensure that community uses were prioritised and that

the floor space of the retail component was limited according to what was needed to serve the

residential areas to the rear.

Members noted the complexity of the items under discussion and there were calls for the item

to be adjourned to the next District Meeting or to a Special Meeting and in response to same

Councillor Collins called for a vote on his motion to amend Councillor Byrne’s motion.

The Meetings Administrator indicated his desire to clarify and accurately record the wording of

the various motions submitted and on the proposal of Councillor Leddin, seconded by the

Mayor, it was agreed to adjourn the Meeting for five minutes.

On the resumption of the Meeting, the Meetings Administrator noted that Councillor Collins

had put forward a motion amending Councillor Byrne’s motion and in accordance with standing

orders Councillor Collins’ motion should be voted on. He noted further that Councillor Butler

had brought forward a separate motion and that this should also be voted on.

The Mayor called for a vote on Councillor Collins’ motion, which had been proposed earlier in

the Meeting and seconded by Councillor Lynch, and the result of the voting was as follows :-

**FOR**

Councillors Collins, Crowley, Gilligan, Lynch, McCreesh, O’Dea and O’Hanlon

Proposed by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Lynch and resolved :-

“That the proposed amendment No. 2 to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011 – 2017

Mungret – Loughmore Area be amended in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief

Executive’s Report dated 20th January, 2016, subject to the amendments to same as set out

hereunder, in accordance with Section 20(3)(d) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as

amended)”

“Remove the proposed mixed use zoning in Mungret College and revert back to current zoning

and omit objective ML05B and any other reference to mixed use there, throughout the

proposed amendment to the Local Area Plan, until a detailed plan for the College is presented”.

“That lands rezoned as serviced sites in Rathmale be zoned as established residential and

agricultural use as there is sufficient zoned land for housing and that the text in the amendment

document should be changed as necessary. The land zoned as established residential is along

the front of the site as shown on the map submitted (see Appendix 1)”.

It was noted that any material alterations to the plan would go on public display for a further

four weeks.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler**

***I call at the next meeting for the Council to engage with University Hospital Limerick to***

***address the ongoing issues of people, visiting or working in the hospital, parking in the***

***surrounding housing estates causing serious traffic and safety concerns.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler noted the lack of sufficient parking spaces within the

hospital grounds to accommodate staff and visitors to the hospital and called on the HSE to

open the recently completed multi-storey car park at the hospital and also provide a taxi rank

there. He stressed that those visiting or working in the hospital and parking in the adjacent

housing estates were preventing residents accessing / exiting their property, blocking site lines

and footpaths and were parking on green areas.

Members supported the motion and noted that plans to relocate the Maternity Hospital to the

University Hospital Limerick site would exacerbate the problem.

**REPLY**:

The Council is aware that there are difficulties arising in adjacent Housing Estates

attributed to people using the University Hospital, Limerick.

We will engage with the Management of the Hospital in relation to these issues

to ascertain their proposals in relation to same.

In the longer term the most effective solution in terms of controlling parking

would be to consider extending parking regulations operated by the Council to

the affected Housing Estates. The initiation of the process would in the first

instance be a matter for the Residents of the Estates.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler**

***I will move at the next meeting that this District calls on the Council to develop one unified***

***cycling strategy for the Limerick Metropolitan area offering a comprehensive and safe cycle***

***network to encourage greater use.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Collins.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler highlighted the health benefits of cycling and its

potential to be used as a mode of transport for many of the short trips currently undertaken by

car around the city. He stressed the need for cycling routes to be taken into consideration in all

city planning and the need to join up existing cycle routes.

In seconding the motion Councillor Collins highlighted the need to encourage greater use of

cycling and the need to protect cycle routes from competing vehicular traffic.

Members supported the motion and stressed the need to focus on the provision of safe cycling

routes for cyclists.

**REPLY**:

The Limerick Metropolitan Cycle Network Study is currently being prepared to

complement the *Limerick Metropolitan District Movement Framework Study*

which was completed last year and presented before the Travel & Transport SPC

on 7th September 2015. It is intended to finalise the Cycle Network Study

shortly.

Following advertisements, the Limerick Smarter Travel Office received feedback

from interested persons and groups, and these views have assisted in the

development of the Limerick Metropolitan Cycle Network Study to date. The

Study when completed will provide a hierarchy of future cycle route

improvements, and will also be a structured basis from which to negotiate with

national funding bodies when seeking financial support for future cycle network

improvements.

**6.**

**Correspondence.**

Members noted correspondence and in reply to an enquiry the Meetings Administrator clarified

that a reply had not been received from Irish Water in relation to supply interruptions in the

area adjacent to the Childers Road.

This concluded the Meeting.

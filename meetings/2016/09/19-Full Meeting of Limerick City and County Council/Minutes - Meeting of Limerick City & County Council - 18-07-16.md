specific item on the Council agenda. Reports will be presented

by the appropriate SPC Chair on a regular basis giving an

update on proceedings at the SPC meetings. Members of an

Economic Development Directorate

Proposed New Limerick Footbridge

The Director, Economic Development, gave a PowerPoint presentation dated 18th

July, 2016, and entitled ‘Limerick City Footbridge’ which included the following:

• The background to the development of the project which included the aims of Limerick

2030 to enhance the waterfront and Fáilte Ireland’s Tourism Proposition and

Interpretation Framework for Limerick City and Environs which highlighted the need to

enhance the visitor experience of Limerick and identified the River Shannon as integral

to the development of a Limerick brand.

• Examples of similar projects at Derry, Gateshead Manchester, Amsterdam and Perth.---
14

• Feasibility analysis, which included consultation on constraints, leading to the selection

of a preferred route and a number of concept designs.

• The issues that had been raised in relation to the project, the context of the proposal

and details of funding.

• That the next step would include the development of the project and the

commencement of a formal structured public consultation process to invite submissions

on developing a new riverway/crossing in the city. The findings of this consultation

process would be presented to the Council and used as the basis for the procurement of

a design team or the holding of a design competition.

Members thanked the Director for his presentation and welcomed the commitment

to consult further with the public in relation to the project and the financial commitments

that had been made in relation to same. The following points were raised by various

Members during discussion of this item:

• That the project should not impinge on views of the historic buildings at the location

of the preferred crossing route nor with the passage of boats on the river or access

to the Curragower Boat Club.

• The project should focus on the development of a public space on the river and the

outer limits of the area on the river to be covered by the project should be defined.

Those with expert and local knowledge should be included in the consultation

process.

• All possibilities to increase public access to the river, including the

expansion/completion of the boardwalk, should be examined.

• The project offered an opportunity to enhance the tourism offering in the City

through the provision of an iconic feature on the river and should be considered in

that regard.

Limerick Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) 2016-

2021

Circulated, report of the Deputy Chief Executive dated 18th July, 2016, together with

Draft Limerick Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) 2016-2021, dated 30th June,

2016.---
16

The report stated that the purpose of the Local Economic and Community Plan was

to set out, for a six-year period, the objectives and actions needed to promote and support

the economic development, and the local and community development, of the relevant

local authority area, both by itself directly and in partnership with other economic and

community development stakeholders.

As part of the LECP process, an extensive consultation and drafting process had been

carried out. This included setting up the Advisory Steering Group in 2015 and the public

consultation on the socio-economic statement and the high level goals (July-Sept 2015).

The Advisory Group had agreed the draft LECP and the LCDC had adopted the draft LECP in

April 2016 following various revisions.

Following the setting up of the Advisory Steering Group, the consultation with the

relevant Bodies and the consideration of the statements of consistency, the adoption of the

Local Economic and Community Plan for Limerick 2016 – 2021 was being recommended.

The majority of Members welcomed the Plan and congratulated the staff who had

been involved in its development. It was noted that the Plan had been developed from the

ground up and identified the agencies responsible for delivery of various aspects of the Plan.

An issue was raised in relation to the absence of a representative of the Municipal

District of Adare-Rathkeale on the Local Community Development Committee (LCDC). It

was noted that the Chief Executive had secured agreement to increase the number of

Elected Members on the LCDC from three to four but that, ultimately, it had been a matter

for the Elected Members of the Council to make these nominations.

Proposed by Councillor Ryan;

Seconded by Councillor Gleeson;

And Resolved:

“That, the Limerick Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) 2016-2021, as

circulated, be and is hereby adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 66 C (4)

(a) of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended.”

(c)

Community Initiative Scheme 2016

Circulated, report of the Deputy Chief Executive dated 12th July, 2016.

The report stated that grants were provided by the Council under the Community

Initiative Scheme (formerly the Contribution Scheme) which had been established to

encourage and support a number of community, cultural or heritage initiatives. The scheme

was open to community-based organisations which included initiatives, events and activities

which promoted cultural and local heritage and generated civic pride. The total budget for

the scheme in 2016 was €100,000 and it was recommended that €80,000 be allocated at

Municipal District level. It was further recommended that €20,000 be reserved for projects---
17

that had a regional culture remit. The Members of each Municipal District had been asked

to nominate organisations within their District for the scheme for 2016 which met with the

above criteria.

The report went on to list the projects that were being recommended to the full

Council for approval. Section 66 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provided

for the approval of such grants.

Proposed by Councillor Galvin;

Seconded by Councillor Ryan;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to recommendations from

the Municipal/Metropolitan Districts for allocations to various Groups and Organisations

under the 2016 Community Initiative Scheme, as set out in report of the Deputy Chief

Executive dated 12th July, 2016, in accordance with Section 66 of the Local Government Act,

2001, as amended.”

ADJOURNED NOTICE OF MOTION

7.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

I will move at the next Meeting that Standing Order No. 3 (Meetings of the Council) be

amended to read as follows: Unless upon any occasion when it is otherwise fixed by

Statute or by Resolution of the Council, Ordinary Meetings of the Council shall be held

monthly on the fourth Monday of the months of September, October, November,

December, January, February, March, April, May, June and July.

Councillor Keary noted that he had agreed at the May Meeting of the Council to

defer this Motion to the July Meeting to allow time for constructive dialogue to take place

on this matter. He highlighted his frustration as a Councillor in dealing with the Executive on

a daily basis since the amalgamation due to the shifting of staff and departments and the

resulting difficulty in identifying the appropriate staff member or department to raise issues

with.

It was agreed to defer this Motion to allow time for the new process regarding

reports from Strategic Policy Committees to be put in place.

NOTICES OF MOTION

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Ryan

I will move at the next meeting that Limerick City and County Council calls on the Minister

for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, TD, to limit the amount of free legal aid

available to offenders who repeatedly offend; and that this Motion be circulated to other

local authorities for support.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ryan noted that people with large numbers of

previous convictions were still in receipt of free legal aid and that such a practice could not

be allowed to continue.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Gleeson.

Members supporting the Motion noted the high cost of free legal aid to the State

and that many in receipt of free legal aid had apparent means.

Members against the Motion noted that such a system would be unjust and

unworkable in that all offences had to be tried based on the evidence and to deny a defence

amounted to a conviction.

Amendments to the Motion that proposed that free legal aid should not apply to

second or subsequent offences and that attachments to earnings should be applied

following convictions were raised and, following discussion, it was agreed that the Motion

should go forward, unamended.

Suspension of Standing Orders: The Mayor drew attention to the time which was

approaching 5.30pm and on the proposal of Councillor Galvin, seconded by Councillor

Sheahan (J), it was agreed to suspend Standing Orders for 30 minutes to facilitate

completion of the Agenda.---
21

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan (to be

referred to Environment Strategic Policy Committee)

I will move at the next Meeting that the current burial ground bye-laws be amended to

permit the standard of maintenance and structure of headstones and kerbing that applied

in graveyards for a period in excess of twenty years.

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council calls on the Government to ensure that

the Commission that was set up to examine the issue of Irish Water and Water Charges is

also tasked with ensuring that people in Group Water Schemes are no longer

discriminated against by having to pay for their water.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Browne and seconded by Councillor Sheehy.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Browne noted the extent of water supplies

serviced by Group Water Schemes. He pointed out that members of these schemes

contributed to the direct cost of the Group Scheme and also, through taxation, to the cost of

running Irish Water, and that this anomaly should be removed.

Members noted the importance of water in maintaining many rural businesses and

the vital role Group Schemes played in this regard.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council protect the current

level of Fire-Fighting Service for the rural and county areas of Limerick.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor

Galvin.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan (J) referred to the risk categorisation

that had been applied to fire stations in the County and the perception that same might lead

to a downgrading of elements of the retained fire service.

Members supported the Motion and noted the high quality of service provided by

the retained fire service and requested that the existing level of service be maintained.

In response to issues raised by Members, the Chief Executive clarified the following:

•

The Fire Service was the only service that had not received reductions in funding or

staff over the course of recent difficult budgets.---
22

•

Risk categorisation was the basis for proper Fire Service management. The concerns

of Fire Fighters would be taken on board and Unions and the Management Group

would engage in relation to same.

•

Brigades responded to call-outs in accordance with pre-determined attendances and,

depending on the nature of the incident and the availability of neighbouring Limerick

brigades, brigades from neighbouring counties could be called out.

•

Difficulties were experienced at times in recruiting suitable candidates for the

retained brigades and these difficulties had to be addressed as they arose.

•

The Fire Service would continue to review service delivery and best practices to

ensure a continued high level of service to the public and a safe environment for

staff and these standards would not be reduced.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors M. Donegan, N.

Gleeson, G. Mitchell, W. O’Donnell, E. Ryan, L.M. Sheehy and B.

Teefy

We will move at the next Meeting that this Council appoints a Tourism Officer.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Donegan and seconded by Councillor Ryan.

The Director of Economic Development acknowledged the importance of tourism to

Limerick City and County and informed the Members that a Tourism Officer would be

appointed in the coming days and would commence working with the various stakeholders

in this area.

Members welcomed the announcement and highlighted the importance of

promoting the tourist potential of all Districts in the Council, including linkage to the Wild

Atlantic Way. Members also noted the importance of developing a Tourism Strategy for the

City and County and the benefits of working with Fáilte Ireland in this regard and also with a

view to drawing down capital funding. The importance of developing Limerick as a prime

tourist destination in order to increase the number of days tourists stayed in the locality was

also discussed.

Suspension of Standing Orders: On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by

Councillor Ryan, it was agreed to suspend Standing Orders for a further 10 minutes to

facilitate completion of the Agenda.---
23

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council include the

alternative footbridge designs by Healy & Co. as part of any further spend on proposals so

that all options are fully considered prior to any final decision being made on this project.

Councillor Leddin indicated that the issue raised by his Motion had been adequately

discussed under Item 4.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L.M. Sheehy

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council calls on the Department of Transport,

Tourism and Sport to provide a budget specific for the provision of disabled parking bays

and other measures, including ramps, to improve accessibility; and that the Council also

calls on the Department to implement national policy that, when upgrading a large

section of footpath in an area (particularly rural town or village) that is built up with

services, the Local Authority is required to include disabled parking.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy and seconded by Councillor Browne.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehy highlighted that there were no specific

grants available to the Council to provide disabled parking bays.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Browne called for the provision of disabled

parking to be made part of policy.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Ó Ceallaigh

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council supports calls for a Referendum to be

held on Irish Unity, and calls on the Government to do likewise.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor

Crowley.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ó Ceallaigh noted that 60% of voters in Northern

Ireland had voted to stay in the EU and that the Good Friday Agreement allowed for such a

referendum.

Members supporting the Motion welcomed the opportunity to debate the issues but

stressed the need to build a consensus on both sides of the border and maintain peace. A

view was also expressed that even if such a poll were successful in the six counties, the

minority would not accept the result and civil unrest would follow.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the Motion was carried.---
24

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Dea

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council publicly supports the

recent call by Limerick Chamber for corporate entities in the Region to support Limerick

FC’s work in the community and, in addition, to make available whatever assistance

possible in order to ensure that this important community work continues.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Dea and seconded by Councillor Donegan.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Dea acknowledged the presence of Pat

O’Sullivan, Chairman of Limerick FC, in the public gallery and welcomed him to the Meeting.

Councillor O’Dea noted the expanding remit of Limerick FC which had a county-wide focus

and carried out tremendous work in the community.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Donegan noted the excellent facilities that had

been developed in Bruff by Limerick FC who were using sport to bring about social

transformation.

Members supported the Motion and joined in welcoming Mr. O’Sullivan to the

Meeting. They congratulated him for his work in promoting soccer in Limerick, for the range

of initiatives he was involved in with disadvantaged communities and for using football to

transform lives.

REPLY:

Limerick Sports Partnership offers support for sports club development,

training and programme delivery. Support to existing clubs is provided in key

areas of club governance with the provision of club development grants,

training and education, funding application assistance and club development

seminars.

There are also three FAI Development Officers based in Limerick to cover

programme delivery and development of the sport within local clubs and

promotion of the sport to schools in Limerick. The idea of a sport specific

Development Officer is to assist in the development of players from grass

root level and up. The relationship between Development Officers and local

clubs/schools has always been productive in the development of this sport in

Limerick and the Council will continue to support all sporting organisations,

including Limerick FC, in any way it can.

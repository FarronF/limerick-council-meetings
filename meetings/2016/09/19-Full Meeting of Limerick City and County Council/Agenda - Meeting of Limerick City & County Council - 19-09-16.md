Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

| will ask at the next Meeting can the Council provide a list of all Council-owned lands
which may be suitable for housing development and how many housing units they
could possibly comfortably fit.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council calls on the
Minster for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to introduce a
scheme akin to the ‘Works in Lieu Scheme/Grant’ which has previously operated in
the Local Authority system to be made available to persons, especially first-time
homeowners, to purchase properties that need refurbishment to make a habitable
home; this grant would be repaid over a fixed term at a rate calculated to equal the
deferential rent persons currently pay for social housing; the Local Authority / State
would have a lean on the property for the fixed term of the repayments so as to
safeguard against any sale or change in title of the property during the term. This
scheme would extend to revitalising our rural towns and villages and encourage
families back to the rural countryside where a plethora of these properties are
available.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler (to be

referred to Travel & Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council request
Shannon Airport Authority to provide a bi-annual (twice yearly) briefing to Members
on its yearly activities and current plans so that we, as a Council, can support its
success and advocate for the needs of the people of Limerick.

Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhir. S. 6 Ceallaigh (fo be referred
to Environment Strategic Policy Committee)

1 will move at the next Meeting that this Council oppose Irish Water's plan to
introduce Orthophosphate to the Water Supply in Limerick and Clare, and instead
calls on them to use those resources to locate and replace lead pipes.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council support extending the opening
period of the Desmond Castle in Newcastle West to include April and all September
to enable more tourists visit Limerick.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. McCreesh (fo be

referred to Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning
Strategic Policy Committee)

| will move at the next Meeting that the companies concerned be requested to
facilitate a public consultation process to assist the communities that will be
impacted by the proposed plans by Irish Cement and Mr. Binman on the Dock Road
sites. The general public within a wide area of these sites have serious concerns
regarding waste management that need to be addressed by the appropriate
expertise.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors C. Prendiville and P.
Keller

We will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the Minister for Finance
urging the Government to drop its plans to spend more money appealing the Apple
Tax judgement and request that instead as much of the money due to the State as is
possible is used to build social and affordable housing desperately needed by this
Council.

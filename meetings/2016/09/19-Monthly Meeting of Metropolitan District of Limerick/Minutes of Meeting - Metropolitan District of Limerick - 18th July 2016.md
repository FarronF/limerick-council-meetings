***plans for these units?***

and 6 duplex type units. Two of these are occupied with the remainder vacant

pending major refurbishment of the overall block. Stage 1 approval, which---

included an approved budget, was received from the Department of Housing,

Planning and Local Government on 12th July, 2016. On foot of this approval the

the commencement of construction work.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the Council has prepared a submission to the EPA about Irish***

***Cement's EPA Emissions Licence application to burn tyres and other waste in Mungret, and will***

***the Councillors be consulted on its contents before it is submitted?***

**REPLY**:

The Council is currently considering whether to prepare a submission to the EPA

in relation to the technical aspects of the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control

Licence. No decision has been taken as yet as to whether the Council will make

such a submission.

We will facilitate the Members of Council by providing any information or

clarifications sought in relation to any submission ultimately prepared, or any

submission by the Members.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a list of sites that could be, or are planned to be, developed***

***as playgrounds?***

**REPLY**:

There are 12 Council run playgrounds in place at the moment, 5 of which are

located within the Metropolitan District and the other 7 are located around the

main county towns. In addition there are 15 community run playgrounds in

County Limerick. The latter were constructed by the Community groups

themselves through Leader funding and the Council give support in the form of

training, annual inspections, insurance cover and an annual allowance.

The Council are continuing to resource this very worthwhile form of recreation

with a new playground under construction in Mungret and proposals to extend

the existing playground in Newcastle West. There are also plans to provide new

playgrounds in Caherdavin and St. Mary’s Park, Limerick.

It is envisaged that local communities will continue to be afforded the

opportunity to apply for funding through the Leader and other programmes to

develop their own playgrounds also. The Council are happy to work with and

advise any local community group who are considering the possibility

of developing a playground in their own area including the suitability of a site for

this specific project.---

***I will ask at the next Meeting who is responsible for monitoring health and safety precautions***

Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005). This details employer’s responsibilities for

Health and Safety, including monitoring. Inspections, in relation to the

enforcement of Health and Safety, are the responsibility of the Health and Safety

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls upon Failte Ireland to***

***attend a future Metropolitan Meeting and present their thoughts on what Limerick must do to***

***enhance our tourism offerings and increase visitor numbers to the City.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin noted the role of Fáilte Ireland in relation to the

capital funding of Tourism Projects and noted that the Council did not have a strategy in place

that identified projects to attract such funding. He stressed the need for the District to engage

with Fáilte Ireland in a collaborative manner, in this regard.

Members supported the motion and highlighted benefits of tourism and the need to maximise

the potential of Limerick in this area. Members highlighted the need for a major festival in the

city. The benefits of achieving Purple Flag Status was raised along with the need for guidance on

how best to achieve this goal.---

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the Egyptian***

***Ambassador to Ireland to support the efforts of all those NGO's and political groups trying to***

***obtain the release of Ibrahim Halawa who has been imprisoned by the Egyptian Government***

***for 3 years.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin acknowledged the efforts of the Government and

NGO’s in this case and noted that the trial of Mr. Halawa was constantly being deferred. In

seconding the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted the reports of mistreatment of prisoners where

Mr. Halawa was being held and called on the Irish Government to do more to secure his release.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan**

***I will move at the next Meeting, given Minister Simon Coveney's rejection of the Commission's***

***proposal to amalgamate Cork City and Cork County Council and to come up with an***

***alternative solution, that this District ask for an urgent review of the position of Limerick City***

***and County Council.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan referred to the original application by the City

Council for a boundary extension which had resulted in the merging of the two Limerick

Authorities with promised savings of €20m. He noted that the rejection of a similar model for

Cork City and County by Minister Coveney called into question the success of the merger of the

Limerick Authorities.

Members supported the motion and the following points were raised by Members during

discussion of the motion :-

 While the merger had promised significant savings, the Council was struggling to deliver

services due to lack of financial resources.

 While there had traditionally been a Mayor associated with the city, there were now two

Mayors associated with the merged authority, leading to confusion for the public and

outside groups seeking to establish contacts with the city.

 There were six electoral areas in the merged authority represented by four Districts with the

city electoral areas unable to have separate statutory meetings.

 There was a poor level of staff attendance at Metropolitan Meetings and agendas were

weak.

 The Minister’s views on the amalgamation of the Limerick and Waterford Authorities should

be sought. The views of the Council’s customers in relation to the Limerick amalgamation

should also be sought.

 Due to the size of Cork County, the proposed merger of the Cork Authorities could not be

realistically compared to the merger of the Limerick and Waterford Authorities.

 Action had been required in relation to the serious financial conditions that had pertained in

the City Council at the time of the merger and a boundary extension would have had serious

financial implications for the County Council.---
7

There was general agreement among the Members that a review of the merger was timely with

a view to addressing any issues that needed to be changed.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan**

***I will move at the next Meeting, to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the death of John***

***Daly, three times Mayor of Limerick, that the Howth Rifle presented to him in recognition of***

***his work to proclaim Ireland a Republic be returned from the National Museum and displayed***

***in this Chamber.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Gilligan highlighted the part John Daly had played in his

work to proclaim Ireland a Republic and the contribution he had made both locally and

nationally.

**REPLY**:

Limerick Libraries and Museum Department will undertake to contact the

Director of the National Museum of Ireland with a request to seek the return of

the Howth Rifle.

It is our experience that the National Museum is more favourably disposed to

returning or loaning artefacts (both long term and short term) to a museum

rather than to a civic space such as a council chamber.

The rationale for this policy is the issue of security and appropriate

environmental conditions for the safe storage of historical objects.

When we have received a reply from the National Museum we will advise further

on the issue.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District reconvenes the previously established Horse***

***Committee to deal with the ongoing issue of horses in the District.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor O’Dea.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that in spite of the high expenditure in this

area, horses were still seen on the streets of the city and continued to be kept in poor

conditions. He called for consideration to be given to the introduction of a horse project and for

zero tolerance to be shown to those who keep horses outside the law.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the potential benefits of engaging with these

horse owners in a positive way to the benefit of both the owners and the horses and the need

for communities to engage in this regard. Members also discussed the need for elements of a

horse project to be located in both the north and south of the city.

**REPLY**:

The Working Group on Horses can be reconvened after the Summer subject to

the availability of the Members.---

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls on the Council***

***to launch an open appeal for ideas and designs, and full public consultation, about developing***

***Limerick City's riverfront using the available money, rather than simply pushing ahead with***

***the proposed footbridge.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that the riverfront was a huge asset to the

city and stressed the importance of engaging with the public to establish their views on how it

could be best developed.

Members highlighted the need for increased consultation on this proposed project and the need

to explore a range of options to improve access to and enjoyment of the river, complete the

existing river walk and improve access to King Johns Castle. Concerns were also raised that any

proposed works would compromise existing views of historic buildings such as the Hunt

Museum.

**REPLY**:

This matter will be addressed at the Meeting of the Limerick City and County

Council to be held on 18th July, 2016 at which a full update on the project will be

provided.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the motion be adjourned, pending the outcome of the

presentation that was to take place at the Meeting of the Full Council that evening.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District marks this Limerick Pride***

***week by writing to the Minister calling for the complete lifting of the ban on blood donations***

***from men who have had sex with men, and instead calling for all blood donations to be***

***screened on the basis of risky sexual behaviour rather than the current, prejudiced system.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that the ban was unnecessary as all blood

was screened prior to use. In seconding the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh noted that a similar

requirement in Northern Ireland had been repealed. During discussion of the motion it was

noted that there were many different instances where blood donation was not accepted on

medical grounds and that this should be the overriding factor.

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor Jerry O’Dea**

***I will move at the next Meeting, in light of the ongoing lack of completion to the tender***

***process, that the Council examine the operation of Municipal Golf Courses in Cork and Dublin***

***in order to compare and evaluate the operation of our own Municipal Golf Course at***

***Rathbane.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Dea and seconded by Councillor Lynch.

In proposing the motion Councillor O’Dea noted that he had raised issues regarding the---
9

maintenance of the course at Rathbane six weeks previously and had received a good response

to same. He highlighted the social and potential financial benefits of the course and the benefits

of learning best practice from Municipal Courses elsewhere. In seconding the motion Councillor

Lynch highlighted the potential benefits of Limerick Sports Partnership engaging with the Club.

**REPLY:**

The procurement process is almost completed and it is expected to come to a

close within the next month. It is intended that the outcome will result in a new

maintenance contract for Rathbane Golf Course for the next five years with the

option of extending it for a further five years. It is not possible to comment

further on the procurement process as it is ongoing.

The proposal that we investigate the operation of other municipal golf courses in

Dublin and Cork can be explored but this was already considered in the past.

Limerick City & County Council tendered for a management company to maintain

Rathbane Golf course and the procurement process is almost completed and as

stated it is intended to have a new contract in place in the very near future.

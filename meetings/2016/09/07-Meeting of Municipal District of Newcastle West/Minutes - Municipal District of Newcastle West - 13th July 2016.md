5. Regional Services Directorate
Fire and Emergency Services

Circulated, Draft Fire and Emergency Operations Plan dated June 2016 prepared under Section
26 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003.

The Senior Assistant Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Scott Keenan, presented a summary of the
background to, and details of the Draft Fire and Emergency Operations Plan, which included an
overview of the Council's Fire Service operations and the 14 sections of the draft plan.

In response to Members queries, he clarified a number of issues as follows:

The draft Section 26 plan described how the fire service was organised. It did not cover the
operational side of the service.

The number of fire fighters positions in each of Limerick’s Retained Fire Stations was 12.

Pre-determined Attendances (PDAs) described the number and type of resources that would be
sent to a particular incident type. Pre-determined attendances were outside the scope of the
Section 26 plan therefore were not detailed in the document.

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
5

The ‘Order of Turn Out’ described the order in which resources would be located to an incident,
based on the location of the incident and the locations of the various stations from which the
resources would be mobilised. Orders of turn out were outside the scope of the Section 26 plan
and were not detailed in the document.

The Area Risk Categorisation process arose from the National Directorate for Fire and
Emergency Management’s Keeping Communities Safe project and represented a standard for
risk categorisation across Ireland which did not exist heretofore. The Area Risk Categorisations
for Limerick were re-categorised to a higher level for 3 retained stations following negotiations
by Fire Service management in Limerick. The risk categorisations as presented in the draft
Section 26 Plan had been approved by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency
Management's External Validation Group.

The Fire Service presented the draft Section 26 plan to the Community, Leisure & Emergency
Services Strategic Policy Committee which was held on Wednesday, 6th July, 2016. The SPC
asked that a presentation on the draft plan be made at each of the District meetings. The Chief
Fire Officer had conducted meetings with a number of retained fire stations and with a number
of whole time shifts regarding the draft Section 26 plan. Hard copies of the draft plan document
had also been provided to each retained fire station and each whole time shift.

In response to further queries from Members, the Senior Assistant Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Ken
Crowley, clarified a number of issues as follows:

The Fire Service fleet in Limerick consisted of 32 Heavy Goods Vehicles and 7 Light Goods
Vehicles. The fleet was managed as a single City and County service covering 7 stations, both
whole time and retained. The cost of a new water tender appliance was in the order of
€250,000. In order to keep the age profile of the Fire Service fleet within National Directorate
Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) guidelines it was necessary to purchase good
quality second-hand appliances when needed.

On the basis that vehicles in those stations that attended a greater number of incidents
incurred the greatest wear and tear, it was the Service’s practice that such stations received
newer vehicles when they entered the fleet. This practice was in keeping with other Fire
Services in Ireland and with private fleet operators in various sectors. The practice of
redistributing the fleet among the stations throughout County Limerick had been in operation
prior to the merger of the two Limerick Local Authorities.

The Fire Service ensured that all of its fleet was safe, serviceable and fit-for-purpose
irrespective of its age.

The Director, Regional Services, noted the Members concerns and agreed to remove the
statement in the Executive Summary to the draft Section 26 Plan which stated that “It is not
intended at this time to apply for any Capital Aid Grant Funding for any major replacement
programme of equipment”. In order to bring a version of the Section 26 plan to the full Council
for approval, the Council would examine if the draft plan could be amended by omitting the risk
categorisation criteria.

Old School to the cemetery, make a new connection to public lighting
including the installation of micro pillars and make the public lighting safer in

There is only funding in the 2016 Burial Grounds budget to carry out Item 1. It is intended to
programme the other works in 2017. If additional funding, however, is found this year we will
proceed with items 2-4 at an earlier stage.

The provision of a New Burial Ground in Abbeyfeale.

Over the last number of years several sites within easy access of Abbeyfeale town have been
assessed, unfortunately due to poor ground conditions they all have been deemed unsuitable
for use as a burial ground.

A desktop study was conducted late last year; another possible suitable site was identified near
Knockbrack. The landowner was contacted regarding the Council seeking approval to carry out a
site assessment on his lands. Unfortunately the land owner in question recently contacted the
Council explaining that he does not wish to allow the Council conduct a site assessment on his
lands nor is he interested in disposing of the land.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Browne stated that the pedestrian crossing at Joy’s corner
was very dangerous and needed to be looked at. He also asked for signage to be reviewed at

REPLY: A scheme has been prepared for Abbeyfeale Traffic Management and is subject
to approval by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (formerly the NRA). A meeting is

available.

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

! will move at the next Meeting that additional crash barriers be installed on the Barna Road
where it meets with the Great Southern Trail.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Browne stated that crash barriers at this location were not
adequate and additional barriers were required.

Seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY: The Council notes that the Southern Trail was constructed at this location only in
recent years. The works associated with the recent overlay contract did not alter
the Trail in any substantive way nor did the Council change its relative location to
the adjoining N21, i.e, the verge width has remained the same. The designer of
the Trail obviously did not see the need for a greater degree of segregation from
the N21 nor indeed the need for a safety barrier.

The Council employed a firm of consultants to undertake the design of this
Scheme. As part of their work they assessed the need for safety barriers along
the Scheme. Their assessment did not identify a need for safety barriers along
the Southern Trail. They did however recommend, on safety grounds, replacing
the timber post and rail fence with the “rail-less” fence now in place.

if the consultants had recommended barriers along the Trail, the space available
in the verge segregating the Trail from the N21 carriageway would not have
allowed for the provision of conventional safety barriers, as there would be an
issue with working width of the barrier, due to the width of the verge, between
the Trail and the adjoining N21 carriageway.

This Scheme was subject to the Road Safety Audit process during the
implementation of the project and no issues around the provision of safety
barriers along the Southern Trail were identified.

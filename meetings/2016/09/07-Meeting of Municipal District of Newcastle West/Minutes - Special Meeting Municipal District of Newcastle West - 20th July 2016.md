reply. She then withdrew from the Meeting.

A discussion took place among Members in relation to the presentation and also regarding the
feasibility report which had been prepared in respect of a pool at Newcastle West. There was
some disagreement in relation to the adequacy of this report, which had been prepared at
considerable cost. It was pointed out however that further information was required in relation
to the issues such as the impact on other facilities, corporate governance and the proposals
now being put forward by Killeline Leisure Centre to provide for a significant extension to their
facility. Members referred to the importance of ensuring that value for money was achieved in
relation to any proposal for the development of a pool at Newcastle West.

In response to queries raised the Operations Manager, West and South Division pointed out that-
it may be necessary to have an independent study carried out in relation to impact of a new
pool on existing facilities before any decision on the matter could be taken.

Members referred to the recent Public Meeting, which was attended by the Minister of State for
Tourism and Sports, where the issue of funding and the role of the Council in relation to the
proposed development was raised and it was agreed that a meeting with the various parties
together with the Oireachtas Members for the area and the Municipal District Members and
the Chief Executive be convened in early September to discuss the proposed facility.

It was proposed that this meeting would be scheduled for the 6'" September, 2016 at 6.p.m. at
Newcastle District Office.

This concluded the Meeting.

Cathaoirleach

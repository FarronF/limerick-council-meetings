1. Disposal of Land

Circulated report of the Director, Regional Services dated 15” July, 2016 setting out details of the
proposed disposal of land by way of exchange of land at the public car park, Rathkeale between
Limerick City and County Council and Limerick Community Games subject to conditions. The
report noted that it was proposed to bring a Section 183 disposal notice in this regard to the full

Council.

Members noted that this matter had been brought before them previously and was subsequently
approved by the full Council but had to be revisited due to difficulties in the administration of
transfer of title to Limerick Community Games. Members noted the proposed disposal as
circulated and agreed that the disposal should proceed to the full Council.

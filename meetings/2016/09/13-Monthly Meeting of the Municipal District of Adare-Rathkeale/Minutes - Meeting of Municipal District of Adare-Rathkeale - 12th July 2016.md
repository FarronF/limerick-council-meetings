NOTI TION

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

| will move at the next Meeting that adequate funding be provided by Limerick City and County
Council in order that basic road maintenance standards can be achieved in the interest of public
health and safety. As the Department is the sole beneficiary from Motor Tax we must give safe
passage to and from our schools, workplaces and for agricultural contractors to carry out their
works safely. | will move also that a schedule be agreed, without delay, for roadside hedgerow
cutting, Phase 1 of which must be school bus routes so that we are ready for September.

Councillor O'Donoghue, in proposing the Motion, noted the extend of overgrown hedges adjacent
to roads in the District and the dangers of same for road users. He requested that a programme
be put in place to cut hedges with priority given to bus routes. He noted that when
representations were made for hedges to be cut there was an expectation that the Councillor
provide the name of the owner/occupier of the land and that this should not be the case.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan who highlighted the under funding of Local
Authorities by the Government and the range of works not being carried out due to lack of
funding. It was agreed that the District would write to the Minister for Housing, Planning and
Local Government, the FF Spokesperson for Housing, the Local Authorities Members Association
(LAMA), the Association of Irish Local Government and each Local Authority calling on all Councils
to lobby the Government to recognise and address the financial plight of Local Authorities.
Members also noted the inability of struggling businesses and household to withstand increases in
rates or household charges.

During discussion Members also agreed a Motion calling for the period covered by Section 40 of
the Wildlife Act, 1976, to be reduced by 6 weeks to cover 1" March to mid July in any year.

REPLY: An effective transport system is central to the functioning of our society and our
economy. Increased transport demand without appropriate infrastructure and
services in place, inevitably leads to increased congestion, longer journey times,
higher costs, suppressed economic activity and inhibits development. The
challenge posed to Local and National Government is to allocate the resources
essential to maintain transport networks and add new capacity as it is needed. This
requires large scale investment and must compete with other policy priorities.

In the 2016 Budget the Council allocated a total of €33 million to Division B — Road
Transport and Safety. This represented a slight increase on the 2015 outturn. The
Council receives significant funding from central government and this generous
support has to be acknowledged.

In 2016 central government grant support for regional and local roads was almost
€13 million and in addition a further €4.4 million was allocated to the Council by the
Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for remedial work programmes
following the severe weather. These allocations are critical to the maintenance of
roads and are most welcome.

It is generally accepted that Ireland needs to move to “Steady State” maintenance
of roads. This is set out in the Government policy document “Investing in Our
Transport Future” which was published by the Department of Transport, Tourism
and Sport in April 2015. To achieve steady state would require transport capital
funding to rise to an average of 1.1% - 1.15% of GDP or an equivalent of €2.3 billion
per annum. This level of expenditure is subject to the state of the public finances
which are now recovering. At a local level it is a matter for the Council to decide its
level of expenditure across a range of services. While addition funding for roads
would be welcome this must be set against other competing demands and the
willingness of the Members to increase rates or the Local Property Tax.

Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 obliges landowners and occupiers of land to take
all reasonable care to ensure that trees, hedges and other vegetation growing on
their land are not, or could not become a danger to people using or working on a
public road.

If a tree, hedge or other vegetation is or could become a danger to those using or
working on a public road the local authority can serve a written notice on the
owner or occupier requiring action to be taken in order to remove the danger or
potential danger. The local authority can carry out the works specified in the notice
itself in any case where the person on whom the notice was served fails to comply
with it.

The public notice is advertised annually by the Council informing landowners and
occupiers of their obligations under the Roads Act.

For the most part landowners comply with the Act and cut their hedges. In cases
where hedges are not cut, Limerick City and County Council serves hedge cutting
notices.

Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users the local authority can
act at once (without serving a notice) to remove or reduce the danger. In either
case the local authority may recover the cost of the works from the landowner or
occupier. It is an offence not to comply with the terms of a notice served by a local

authority.

In addition it must be noted that the local office has recently employed a contractor
to carry out hedge cutting on the junctions on the regional roads and some selected
local roads. We do not have the resources to extend this contract currently.

Members raised the issue of free legal aid being available to repeat offenders and on the proposal
of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O’Brien it was agreed that the District would write
to the Minister for Justice and Equality calling on the Government to put systems in place whereby
the cost of legal aid would be recoverable from offenders on conviction of a second or subsequent

offence.

3. Regional Services Dir:

Circulated, Draft Fire and Emergency Operations Plan dated June 2016 prepared under Section
26 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003.

The Director, Regional Services indicated that the Community, Leisure and Emergency Services
Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) had requested that a presentation on the Draft Operations Plan
be made at each of the District Meetings.

Mr. S. Keenan, Senior Assistant Chief Fire Officer presented a summary of the background to, and
details of the Draft Fire and Emergency Operations Plan, which included an overview of the
Council's Fire Service operation and the 14 sections of the draft plan.

Members thanked the Assistant Chief Fire Officer for his presentation and paid tribute to the work
carried out by the Fire Service and expressed concerns that the service would be downgraded in

any way.

The following points were clarified by the Senior Assistant Chief Fire Officers in response to
queries raised by Members.

¢ Replacement of equipment was an ongoing activity and reference in the draft plan to the
funding of same would be clarified.

¢ Due to the high cost of new appliances it was appropriate to purchase good quality second
hand appliances when necessary.

¢ All vehicles had to be serviceable and fit for purpose and the fleet was managed to ensure
that newer vehicles were exposed to greater use. The practice of redistributing the fleet
among the retained brigades in the County had been in operation prior to the merger of
the two Limerick Local Authorities.
A high standard of personal equipment and kit was available to all fire fighters.
Area Risk Categorisation had been carried out in 2014 based on call outs in the previous
three years. Gorse fires would have been included in such call outs and same would be
clarified to the Members.

¢ There were national guidelines in relation to the age of vehicles in use and all vehicles were
well maintained.

e The process of Area Risk Categorisation has been ongoing for a number of years and had
been communicated to the Fire Fighters. Discussions with the Fire Fighters Unions in
relation to same had been taking place at national level.

e The number of appliances sent to an incident was based on the information received in the
call out. Assistance from neighbouring Fire Authorities may also be required based on the
nature of the incident and the availability of neighbouring stations within this Council’s Fire
Service. The background to why a Shannon brigade was called to an incident in Galvone
would be forwarded to Members.

The Director, Regional Services indicated that the approval of the Plan was a reserved function of
the full Council. She pointed out that the issues raised would be examined further with a view to
the finalisation of a draft plan for consideration by the Council.

8. Community Initiative Scheme

Director, Regional Services circulated proposals for spending the €20,000 allocated to Community

QUESTIONS

9. Question submitted by Councillor Adam Teskey

| will ask at the next Meeting approximately how much it costs to maintain the park in Adare on
an annual basis and how much funding is available for the park for the remainder of this year.

REPLY: We have maintained Adare Park with an annual budget of €25,000 for the last
number of years. This year, however, the allocated budget for the park through
GMA was €5,714 all of which has been expended. Efforts have been made to
identify additional monies within the Adare-Rathkeale District expenditure areas. It
is not possible to reallocate without there being a knock on effect. It has been
decided that a further €10,000 will be reallocated from the Roads General
Maintenance budget.

10. Question submitted by Councillor Adam Teskey

1 will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to bring forward the date for the cutting of
hedgerow’s on public roads in the district.

REPLY: SECTION 40 of the WILDLIFE ACT 1976 AS AMENDED by the WILDLIFE
(AMENDMENT) ACT 2000 states that

‘It shall be an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise
destroy any vegetation growing in any hedge or ditch during the period
beginning on the 1st day of March and ending on the 31st day of August

in any year’.

Accordingly the Council is not in a position to change the dates as requested.

NOTICES OF MOTION

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

| will move at the next Meeting that the Department of Transport carry out an immediate
investigation into the Part 8 Planning Application for Road Overlay Works in Adare Village which
are about to commence without due consideration being given for the inclusion of a foul sewer
to serve adjacent lands and which will, if omitted on this occasion, necessitate the re-excavation
of this stretch of road at a conservative cost of €1,000,000.00 to the hard pressed tax payer and
cause months of repeated traffic flow disruption.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Keary called on Members to support his motion and thereby
seek to put an end to a situation whereby the necessary laying of a foul sewer system to service
proposed housing developments on Council and private lands at an estimated cost of between
€80,000 and €100,000 would not go ahead as part of the agreed overlay works. Councillor Keary
noted that, should these works be carried out at a later date, they would cost in the region of €im
and would require the new overlay works to be dug up and result in repeated traffic disruption.
Councillor Keary noted that the required works could be funded from the sale of the Courthouse
in Adare Village and quoted policy H1 and objective IN3 from the Adare Local Area Plan 2015-2021
in support of the need to lay a foul sewer system at this opportunity. He stressed that he did not
have a negative attitude towards Adare nor was he trying to prevent the proposed overlay works
taking place. He noted the large number of young people born in Adare who were seeking to set
up home there and who would benefit from the availability of serviced land in the village.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan who pointed out that it was common sense to
spend €80,000 now compared to €1,000,000 in the future and called on the Members to continue
to work as a team with the executive to achieve this goal. He also stressed that he was not anti
Adare or anti investment in Adare.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately exercise their
powers and prevent illegal trading taking place from unauthorised premises that have been

brought to their attention in recent months.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Keary indicated that unauthorised development, trading from
the old mart premises, was affecting legitimate businesses in the area who paid commercial rates.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan who stressed that every step should be taken to
protect rate payer.

REPLY: The Planning Enforcement Section of Limerick City and County Council investigate
all complaints received and instigate enforcement proceeding where appropriate.
Proper procedure in relation to planning enforcement as set out in the Planning and
Development Act 2000 (as amended) is followed at all times.

14. Correspondence

Correspondence was noted. Members noted that if schools wished to expand then the issues in
relation to traffic calming and set down areas should be addressed prior to expansion as part of
the planning process and that the Council’s Planning Department should be contacted in this

regard.

The following issues were raised at the conclusion of the agenda :-

On the proposal of Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor Keary the following Motion was
agreed by Members.

| move that a street scaping / public realm improvement plan for the town of Rathkeale be put in
place, similar to what has happened in Patrickswell and Mungret. Given the improved economic
situation and the fact that Rathkeale is the Municipal capital town, with the local area Council
offices located there, | feel this would be a step in the right direction. It would be a proactive
approach for us to have this plan ‘shovel ready’ if such funding were to be made available for
projects like this in the future.

Members also noted that the ‘Love Your Street Initiative’ should be implemented in Rathkeale.

A number of areas in Askeaton were overgrown with grass and weeds; The Sli na Slainte walk, the
area around the old bank building, the Ferry Bridge and the adjacent road and the two footpaths
from GAA field in Askeaton to the nearby junction.

Members highlighted the hight rate of stray dogs in Limerick and the Rathkeale area having to be
put down. The Director, Regional Services indicated that these concerns would be raised with the

appropriate staff.

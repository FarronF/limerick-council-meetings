**Item 3:**

**Consideration of Draft Fire and Emergency Operations Plan under**

**Section 26, Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003 (copy attached).**

Mr. Michael Ryan, Chief Fire Officer gave an overview of the background to the Fire Plan

which had already been circulated to members.

Chair thanked Chief Fire Officer for his presentation and complimented the fire fighters for

their ongoing commitment and professionalism in the delivery of their duties.

The majority of the Councillors present complimented the fire service and fire fighters and

their work. However they would not support this plan if the formation of the policy could

potentially result in the number of personnel being reduced in the fire service.

C. Curley, Director of Services explained that Section 26 is a reserved function of the council

and the Local Authority is obligated to have this plan. Currently they are working off two

separate plans. It has come to the SPC meeting as an advisor on policy and will be brought

before the full Council Meeting. She advised that there is a national standard which all fire

services are required to comply with and this will improve fire safety.

Following further discussion it was agreed that the plan would be referred before each

Municipal District Meetings. This was formally proposed by Councillor Kevin Sheahan and

seconded by Councillor Michael Collins.

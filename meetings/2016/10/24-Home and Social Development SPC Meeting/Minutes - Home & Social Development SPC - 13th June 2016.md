**Item 3:**

**Update on Syrian Resettlement Programme**

The members received an update on this programme. As part of a UN commitment the

Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (Department of Justice and Equality) have

asked the Local Authority to house up to 100 Syrian programme refugees in 2016, who

come from refugee camps. The first ten families arrived in Limerick in May and were

housed in Newcastle West (3) and the City Environs (7). An inter-agency group is working

with the Department of Justice to provide the necessary supports to these families. West

Limerick Resources and the Paul Partnership have employed resettlement workers to work

locally with the families. The refugees go through an eight week programme before they

arrive.

**Item 4:**

**Presentation on drafting of Allocations Policy**

It was outlined that the two separate schemes that are currently being used in the Council,

based on the old Local Authority areas. A draft policy will be prepared over the summer and

will be brought before the next SPC. Members who are interested can email any queries or

suggestions.

In discussion the members stated that more unified up thinking is needed between different

sections e.g. allocations and local area engineers, that the time period between handing

back keys and reletting properties should be examined and that there should be an audit of

occupancy of stock. It was suggested that a workshop on allocations would be beneficial.

Several comments were made in relation to the Joint Allocations Policy.

**Item 5:**

**Presentation on Tenant Purchase Scheme Exclusions**

The members received a presentation on the new incremental tenant purchase scheme and

current demand. It was highlighted that the legislation *Sale of Local Authority Houses*

*Regulations 2015* excludes

(a) houses that have been specifically designed for elderly persons,

(b) houses that haves been provided to facilitate the transition from institutional care to

community-based living of persons with disabilities

(c) group housing for travellers

(d) a caravan, a mobile home, etc

(e) houses that have been transferred in a Part V agreement

(f) houses in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons of proper

management of the authority’s stock of housing accommodation or on account of the

house’s structural condition

(g)houses that should not be sold for the time being on account of proposals the authority

has to carry out reconstruction or improvement works under section 12 of the Housing Act

1988 or for the regeneration of the area in which the house is located.
---
It was proposed that based on the high level of demand and the low level of turnover (i.e.

stock returned for allocation) single occupancy units should be excluded due to the high

level of demand on the waiting list. It was agreed that this should be discussed further at

the next Strategic Policy Meeting.

**Item 6:**

**Any other business**

No other business was raised

The meeting concluded.

**Next Meeting: 24th** **of October 2016**

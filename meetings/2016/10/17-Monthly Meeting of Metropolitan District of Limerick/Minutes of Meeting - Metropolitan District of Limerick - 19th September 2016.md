**Physical Development Directorate**

**(a)**

**Part 8 Procedure** **–** **Patrickswell Village Renewal Scheme**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Service Operations dated 14th September, 2016 enclosing copy

of the Chief Executive’s Report dated September, 2016, detailing proposed works in the Village

of Patrickswell, Co. Limerick, that had been prepared in accordance with Section 179(3) of the

Planning and Development Act 2000-2015 and Part VIII of the Planning and Development

Regulations, 2001-2015 and noted that, in accordance with Section 179(4)(b) of the Planning

and Development Act 2000-2015, it was proposed to proceed in accordance with the Chief

Executive’s Report.

Members welcomed the proposed development and discussed the possibility of using urban

renewal funding to extend the proposed project. The Director, Physical Development informed
---
2

the Members that the project would involve capital expenditure of approximately €1.5m which

was not currently available. He noted the possibility of carrying out the project in stages, as

funding came available, and undertook to revert to the Members in relation to same in due

course.

**(b)**

**Pilot Project for the Introduction of 30 km/hr Special Speed Limits in Five Housing**

**Estates in the District**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Physical Development, dated 9th September, 2016 setting out

details of a proposed pilot project for the introduction of a 30 km/hr special speed limit in a

number of housing estates in Limerick City and County. The report detailed 15 housing estates

in the Metropolitan District of Limerick where it was proposed to commence the pilot project

and sought the approval of the Members to prepare draft bye-laws in this regard and to

commence the public consultation phase as outlined in stage 2 of the report.

Members welcomed the proposal as worthwhile and timely given the high population density in

these estates, the dangers that traffic poses to children in estates, and the opportunity the

measures would afford to the Gardai to enforce these reduced speed limits.

On the proposal of Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Daly, it was agreed to proceed in

accordance with the circulated report.

Members extended sympathy to the family of Kellycia Nudiri who had died in a tragic accident

on the M20.

Members also extended sympathy to staff member, Tom O’Callaghan and family on the recent

death of his mother Christina O’Callaghan.

**Social Development Directorate**

**(a)**

**Part 8 Procedure** **–St. Mary’s Park**

Circulated, Report of the Director, Service Operations dated 12th September, 2016 enclosing copy

of the Chief Executive’s Report, setting out details of the proposed works including 20 No. infill

housing units, public realm improvement works and all associated ancillary works. It was noted

that the Chief Executive’s Report had been prepared in accordance with Section 179(3)(a) of the

Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and Part 8 of the Planning and Development

Regulations, 2001 (as amended) and that, in accordance with Section 179(4)(b) of the Planning

and Development Act 2000 (as amended) it was proposed to proceed in accordance with the

Members welcomed the proposed works and noted the poor condition of paths, roads and

houses in the area and the need for works to be carried out to improve same.

**(b)**

**Raising of Loan**

Circulated, Report of the Acting Director, Social Development, dated 16th September, 2016

setting out proposals to raise a loan of €1.7m to undertake refurbishment works at the

Watergate Complex which consisted of 100 apartments constructed in 1969. It was noted that
---
3

the works would include external insulation of the complex, attic insulation and replacement

glazed windows, thereby reducing energy costs, improving the living environment and

addressing ongoing maintenance issues. The report proposed the recommendation to Full

Council for approval of an application for sanction from the Minister for Housing, Planning,

Community and Local Government, in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act

2001 (as amended) for a loan of €1,700,000 under Section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous

Provisions) Act 2009 to fund these works and sought approval of the District Members to

proceed in this regard.

Members welcomed the proposals to carry out the improvement works outlined and the

following points were made by Members during discussion of this item :

 The management of the complex in relation to maintenance and anti social behaviour was

an ongoing issue and the Council should allocate a staff member to liaise with the tenants in

this regard.

 The play areas around the Watergate Apartment Complex should be improved and expanded

into some of the unused space at the complex.

 The site was used by individuals engaging in anti social behaviour and CCTV at the site

should be enhanced to help deal with same.

In reply to queries raised by Members, the Senior Project Manager, Social Development noted

that the new windows to be installed would help to reduce the noise levels in the apartments

audible from the adjoining streets and that the proposed expenditure, spread over 100

apartments, represented good value for money.

On the proposal of Councillor Daly, seconded by Councillor McCreesh, it was agreed that the

application for approval for sanction for a loan of €1.7m in accordance with the details as set out

in the report dated 16th September, 2016 would be recommended to the full Council for

approval.

**QUESTIONS**

**4.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to clarify the current situation regarding the***

***transfer of approximately 21 acres of lands situated at Ballykeefe, from Seamus Braddish to***

***Limerick City and County Council as part of original agreement between both parties in lieu of***

***development levies.***

**REPLY:**

The Council continues to try to regularise the position and secure the optimum

outcome in this matter.

In this regard engagement has been ongoing. However the land is not in our

ownership but we are continuing negotiations with the owner to acquire these

lands at Ballykeefe.

Councillor Leddin expressed his dissatisfaction with the reply circulated to his question and it

was agreed that the Property Department would contact Councillor Leddin on this matter.

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the latest situation regarding the development***

***of the so called Opera Centre and when we can expect a final clarification on the nature of the***

***proposed redevelopment of this site and a time frame for when construction and completion is***

***expected.***

**REPLY**:

The Council in May requested LCO Enterprise Development Company (now

Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development DAC) to prepare design

frameworks for each of the above mentioned sites and other sites identified in

Limerick 2030. The purpose of the design frameworks is to identify the optimum

use mix and key urban design principles that should apply to their development

and to examine the business case for their development.

In respect of the Opera Site, Aecom, the appointed client’s representatives are

currently reviewing the 2013 framework and examining the business case that

would underpin the development of the site. It is anticipated that this review will

be completed in the coming month and a briefing will be provided to Council at

that time.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how much was spent on preventing flooding in the***

***Castleconnell/Montpelier/O Brien's Bridge area by the Council during last year's floods.***

**REPLY**:

The amount of emergency funding spent in preventing flooding in the east

Limerick areas of Castleconnell, Montpelier, Mountshannon Road, Ballyvolane

and Annacotty during the winter of 2015/16 was approx €350,000.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting who approved the content of the Limerick 2020 Bid Document***

***and specifically who endorsed the language used for the profile and description of Limerick***

***City in the introduction page of the Bid Document.***

**REPLY**:

Every city considering or actually bidding for European Capital of Culture

designation will have its own local objectives in line with its own circumstances

and priorities. A priority can be to act as a catalyst for a step-change in the city, or

to create greater international understanding and profile, and increase in tourism

and reputation. Advice from Creative Europe on bidding includes the following: *A*

*city can challenge itself.* In fact cities identifying the greatest challenges have

often been seen as the most successful such as Glasgow or Marseille. Some cities

have even tackled very difficult histories for example *Linz2009 tackled its*

*connection with the Nazi period. Liverpool08 explored its role in the slave trade.*

Preparing a European Capital of Culture bid is also an opportunity for a city to

generate considerable benefits, not least urban regeneration, changing a city's

image and raising its visibility and profile on an international scale. It is seen to

be a transformative project for the winning city. e.g. when choosing the 2016
---
5

winner San Sebastian, in the Basque Region of Spain, the jury panel highlighted

its strong commitment to fighting violence and its use of culture in achieving this

goal. Glasgow 1990, Lille 2004 and Liverpool 2008 are widely viewed as examples

of very successful image change strategies as part of their bid. Many cities with a

previously low (and, at times, even negative) profile have experienced an image

renaissance, attracting considerable media attention and enhancing local,

national and international perceptions. Cities such as Glasgow, Lille, Liverpool,

Pécs and Turku have been successful in repositioning themselves as cultural hubs

at a national and/or European level in the wake of their event years.

In this context we focused on Limerick's need for the designation to assist in the

re-imagining and transformation of our city and county. To continue the change

in perception of Limerick in the national context.

We also felt it was important for the jury to know our particular social challenges

and that Limerick's urgencies were deep, historical and difficult.

A line in the opening page describes Limerick as 'A place transcending a

reputation as Ireland's 'problem city' seeking not to be fixed in one locality or

paradigm but open to the flow of wider influences'.

We have come a long way over the last number of years and the team felt that it

was important to be honest when referring to our history and how it has defined

the new ambition for Limerick to be a strong European City.

As a central part of our bid strategy was to be honest about where we were

coming from and ambitious about where we wanted to go. From this context

every word was carefully chosen to deliver this particular message.

The bidding process was a powerful catalyst in galvanising Limerick to think more

strategically about our collective cultural offer. Our challenge now is to maintain

this.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the current status of the plans for the proposed***

***works to solve the flooding problems on Hyde Road.***

**REPLY**:

A scheme has been designed to alleviate the flooding problem on Hyde Road.

This scheme has been tendered and a contractor appointed. He is due to

commence work on site, week commencing the 19th September 2016.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many times, and in what formats, does the Council attempt***

***to contact those on the housing waiting list about the housing needs re-assessment before***

***removing them from the waiting list.***
---
6

**REPLY**:

We made two attempts, in writing, to contact applicants. The first letter provided

applicants with a stamped address envelope. We also made contact via phone or

email if available.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for the latest update from the Council in terms of providing***

***possible suitable long term spaces for Jigsaw Youth Mental Health project to set up in***

***Limerick.***

**REPLY**:

The Council is actively working with the Jigsaw group on the provision of a

premises suitable to their long term needs. A number of meetings have taken

place with Jigsaw directly and a number of options have been considered. The

Council hopes to be in a position shortly to jointly finalise with Jigsaw a plan for

its long term future in Limerick.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor John Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what the future plans for Nicholas Street are, given the fact that***

***the Council own many properties in the area.***

**REPLY:**

LCCC have undertaken the ‘Development and Archaeological Strategy’ for King’s

Island (DASKIL) which seeks to balance the demands for development of this

strategic historic area of the city whilst also safeguarding sites of archaeological

significance. The responsible approach being promoted is neither to be blind to

the past or frozen in it. Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) is actively

involved in a series of initiatives in the Nicholas Street area with the ultimate aim

to revitalise the area from a residential, commercial, tourist and cultural point of

view. Firstly, LCCC intervened in the property market to acquire buildings where

the appetite of the private market was low. Many of these buildings were in a

semi-derelict condition. Given the low demand, the initial approach has been to

stabilise and safeguard these structures for ultimate re-use. Market conditions

have improved with increased economic activity. Accordingly, interest from

potential users of these structures has increased.

The list below outlines recent interventions:

**Address**

**Works carried out since acquisition**

24 Nicholas Street

 Reconstruction of front façade due to the unstable

nature of this element of structure and removal of

pigeon guano

 Roof works to waterproof the structure.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council, in line with its stated policy of developing***

***Limerick as a City of Culture, find a resolution for the Fire Place Site at Nicholas Street now***

***coming up to 25 years as an eyesore in the heart of our City; undertake immediate works to***

***preserve the ancient Walls of Limerick, overgrown and crumbling, on the Island Road and***

***remove the dump at river side of King John’s Castle.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan highlighted the high cost of maintaining the fireplace

site while the Walls of Limerick on the Island Road were disintegrating. In relation to the area

on the river side of King John’s Castle, he noted that a large amount of silt had accumulated

there and the location was being used as a dumping ground and detracted from the amenity of

the river.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is actively pursuing a resolution for the Fireplace

Site in partnership with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and

Gaeltacht Affairs. Currently, stabilisation works to the Fireplace Site are

underway with the ultimate aim, along with other key projects, to revitalise the

overall Nicholas Street area.
---
8

The following steps are in progress / planned for the ‘Fireplace’ site:

1. Treatment of overgrowth and ivy on site (complete);

2. Examination of stone fragments on site by a qualified archaeologist to

identify any cut stone / fragments of stone of archaeological interest and

preparation of a stone catalogue for submission to the Department of Arts,

Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (complete);

3. Stabilisation works are complete to the wall between No 35 and the Fireplace

site (complete);

4. Stabilisation works to the boundary wall at the rear of the site including

dismantling a section which will be reconstructed;

5. Record and draw the elevations of the walls (three exposed sides);

6. Re-point the stonework to the existing walls;

7. Archaeological excavation of the site;

8. Based on the results of 7 above, and in consultation with the Department of

Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, prepare a Design Brief

for an appropriate development (potentially including the adjoining structure

at No. 35 Nicholas Street).

**REPLY:**

The grass bank at the river side of King Johns Castle is part of the natural

evolution of the River Shannon and has developed over many years as a result

of mud and other detritus deposited by rivers tides. The proposed removal of this

grassed mud bank would have environmental and archaeological implications and

would require consultation with Waterways Ireland, The Department of Arts,

Heritage Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, The National Parks and Wildlife

Service and the Office of Public Works because of the EU Habitats Directive.

The EU Habitats Directive designates the Lower River Shannon as a Special

Area of Conservation (SAC) (site code:002165). The overall site is a candidate SAC

selected for lagoons and alluvial wet woodlands, both habitats listed on Annex I

of the E.U. Habitats Directive. The site is also selected for floating river

vegetation,

molinia

meadows,

estuaries,

tidal

mudflats,

atlantic

salt

meadows, mediterranean salt meadows, Salicornia mudflats, sand banks,

perennial vegetation of stony banks, sea cliffs, reefs and large shallow inlets and

bays all habitats listed on Annex I of the E.U. Habitats Directive. The site is also

selected for the following species listed on Annex II of the same directive – Bottle-

nosed Dolphin, Sea Lamprey, River Lamprey, Brook Lamprey, Freshwater Pearl

Mussel, Atlantic Salmon and Otter.

Councillor Gilligan indicated that the reply in this case had been unacceptable.

**Proposed Housing Development at Drominbeg**

Councillor Crowley noted that a notice of motion she had submitted in relation to a proposed

housing development in Drominbeg had not been included on the agenda. Councillor O’Hanlon

informed the Meeting that residents from Drominbeg were now in attendance in the public

gallery at the meeting and he proposed that standing orders be suspended for 20 minutes to

allow a representative of the Drominbeg Members to address the Meeting. This proposal was

seconded by Councillor Crowley.

The Meetings Administrator informed the Meeting that he had received the following legal

advice from the Council’s Solicitors :-

“It is not appropriate for planning applications to be discussed by Council members particularly

at a meeting that is a public meeting and any member of the public can be present.

There is a procedure laid down by the Planning Legislation as to how a planning application

should be dealt with.

The making of a decision to grant an application for planning permission is an executive function

which is discharged by the Chief Executive or a duly delegated official.

Prior to the amendment to the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the Manager (as the office

then was) could be directed by the elected members to grant permission following a Resolution

by the elected members. That was covered by Section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001.

However, this did not convert the decision making function to a reserve function and the final

decision was ultimately an executive function.

The procedures involved in making a planning application involve publication of the application

which affords members of the public an opportunity to make a submission or an objection on

the planning application within a specified time.

There is nothing in those procedures that involve the Councillors other than to make enquiries

and a right to attend a pre-planning meeting. This is a statutory provision whereby an applicant

can request a pre-planning meeting and can be accompanied by a Councillor. However, the

Councillor has to be very careful in attending such pre-planning meetings because they are

bound by the ethics legislation.

The Councillors have to be very conscious of the ethical framework and the contents of the

policy document that all Councillors have regarding the Code of Conduct for members.

If planning applications, which have not been decided on, were to be discussed at District or

Council Meetings, it would create a serious concern. Clearly some form of debate would take

place on these applications. That would be a public debate and would be well outside the scope

of the procedures involved in seeking planning permission.

There is little doubt that if an applicant were, for instance, refused planning permission because

of some submission made by a Councillor at a members meeting and the applicant was able to

prove that the planners were in some way influenced to alter the permission or refuse, the

applicant may well be able to get the decision struck down.

The applicant in that situation could argue that the Chief Executive or his planning officials were

influenced in some way or another by representations made by a Councillor to deal with the

application in some way favourable to the Councillor that could create serious difficulties”.

The Meetings Administrator stressed that, given the above advice, Councillor Crowley’s motion

had not been included on the agenda and he advised the Members that this matter should not

be discussed any further at the Meeting.
---
10

Following discussion it was agreed that a vote be taken on Councillor O’Hanlon’s motion to

suspend standing orders for 20 minutes and the result of the voting was as follows :

**YES**

Councillors Costelloe, Crowley, Daly, Gilligan, Keller, Leddin, Lynch, McCreesh, O’Hanlon,

Prendiville, Secas

(11)

**NO**

Councillors Butler, Hurley, Loftus, Ó Ceallaigh, Sheahan

(5)

The Deputy Mayor noted that, as two thirds of the Members present had voted in favour of the

motion, it was carried.

A representative of the Drominbeg residents was invited to address the meeting and the

Meetings Administrator stressed that no reference should be made to any particular planning

application and that the discussion be confined, in general terms, to the Council’s policy in

relation to social housing.

Mr. David France, representing the Drominbeg Residents, raised a number of issues in relation

to the Council’s social housing policy including communications and the consideration of the

adequacy of facilities in locations where social housing was proposed.

It was agreed that the issues raised would be brought to the attention of the Home and Social

Development Strategic Policy Committee.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler**

***I call at the next Meeting for the Council to apply to become a member of the UNESCO***

***Creative Cities Network created to promote cooperation amongst cities that have identified***

***creativity as a strategic factor for sustainable urban development building on lessons learnt***

***from the 2020 bid.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler noted that the UNESCO Creative Cities Network

(UCCN) was created in 2004 to promote cooperation with and among cities that have identified

creativity as a strategic factor for sustainable urban development. The 116 cities which currently

make up this network work together towards a common objective: placing creativity and cultural

industries at the heart of their development plans at the local level and cooperating actively at

the international level. The Network covers seven creative fields: Crafts and Folk Arts, Media

Arts, Film, Design, Gastronomy, Literature and Music.

By joining the Network, cities commit to sharing their best practices and developing

partnerships involving the public and private sectors as well as civil society in order to:

 strengthen the creation, production, distribution and dissemination of cultural activities,

goods and services;

 develop hubs of creativity and innovation and broaden opportunities for creators and

professionals in the cultural sector;
---
11

 improve access to and participation in cultural life, in particular for marginalized or

vulnerable groups and individuals;

 fully integrate culture and creativity into sustainable development plans.

Councillor Butler pointed out that the Creative Cities Network was a privileged partner of

UNESCO, not only as a platform for reflection on the role of creativity as a lever for sustainable

development but also as a breeding ground of action and innovation, notably for the

implementation of the post-2015 Development Agenda.

**REPLY:**

The UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) was created in 2004 to foster

international cooperation with and between cities that have recognized creativity

as a strategic factor for sustainable urban development.

The member cities that form the Network come from diverse regions; have

different income levels and populations. All members work together towards a

common mission: placing creativity and cultural industries at the core of their

development plans at the local level and actively cooperate at the international

level.

The Creative Cities Network is first and foremost composed of cities ready to pool

their resources, their experiences and knowledge for the common objectives laid

out in the Network’s Mission Statement. A city is designated UNESCO Creative

City based on its action plan and potential contribution to the Network’s

objectives set out in its application.

To become a member of the UCCN, candidate cities must submit an application

that clearly demonstrates their willingness, commitment and capacity to

contribute to the objectives of the Network. The UCCN Mission Statement, the

Designation Procedure and the Application Form give further guidance and

should be considered as key reference documents.

The UNESCO Creative Cities website does not currently list the next application

deadline. The process of application is substantial and begins with a decision of

Council.

The criteria for application to become a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities

Network are as follows:

The city should first create a management team within the municipality or a

specific department, centre or unit in charge of the development of cultural

industries and/or cultural development and designate a focal point. The

management team will be ultimately responsible for drafting the application and,

if the city is designated, will be responsible for the day-to-day management of

activities related to the Network along with a representative of the municipality.

A primary contact or focal point should be designated within the team for all

communications with UNESCO.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move that the Council works in partnership with the OPW to develop flood risk plans for***

***the Castleconnell / Montpelier / O’Brien’s Bridge area.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

In proposing the motion Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh highlighted the flooding that had taken place in

Castleconnell, Montpelier and O’Brien’s Bridge at the end of 2015 and noted that the OPW’s

flood maps showed Castleconnell as not at risk. He stressed the importance of Council staff

who had been involved in flood management passing on the knowledge of the flood locations to

the OPW.

**REPLY:**

The Council are in consultation with the Office of Public Works in relation to the

draft flood risk management plans arising from the Shannon CFRAM Study.

The CFRAM section of the OPW has confirmed that they will undertake a review

of the draft flood risk management plans for the Castleconnell / Montpelier /

O’Brien’s Bridge area.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that a briefing be held for all Metropolitan Councillors in***

***relation to plans for the development of the city centre and what, if any, implications the***

***development of the Horizon Mall will have on future plans.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

**REPLY**:

The Council in May requested LCO Enterprise Development Company (now

Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development DAC) to prepare design

frameworks for each of the strategic sites identified in Limerick 2030. The

purpose of the design frameworks is to identify the optimum use mix and key

urban design principles that should apply to their development and to examine

the business case for their development.

Substantial progress has been made in recent months by Limerick Twenty Thirty:

 Planning consent has been obtained for the development of the Hanging

Gardens and the procurement of the main contractor is currently underway

with a view to having work commencing on site in January 2017.

 A revised master plan for the Opera site is well advanced and will be

presented to the Council in coming weeks.

It is intended to commence the master planning of the other sites in the coming

months. In addition to the development of the strategic sites other initiatives

currently underway in the city centre include the design for the upgrading of

O'Connell Street, public consultation of the proposed footbridge and a number of

private sector proposals currently in the planning process.

The Horizon Mall currently has no planning consent and as such is not impacting

on the redevelopment of the city centre. It is not envisaged that the Horizon Mall

will be developed as a retail centre but for other uses that will support the city

centre rather than compete with it.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh (to be referred to the**

**Joint Policing Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District that this Council takes a more***

***active role in resolving the ongoing problems associated with student events in licensed***

***premises in the Milk Market area. The commencement of the new academic year has again***

***seen unacceptable levels of behaviour by the patrons as they arrive and leave the Night Clubs.***

***There are many families living in this area that have to endure this situation on at least three***

***nights every week.***

Councillor McCreesh noted that this motion was to be sent to the Joint Policing Committee and

highlighted that the scale of activity that had occurred in the Milk Market area during fresher

week was such that it would not have been licenced as a single event. He pointed out that

emergency vehicles would not have gained access to the area and expressed concern that

venue capacities had been adhered to.

Members supported the motion and it was pointed out that a set closing time in Ireland,

compared to elsewhere in Europe, contributed to high numbers arriving on the street at the

same time. Members also noted that this issue should be considered as part of the night time

strategy that was under development by the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning

Strategic Policy Committee.

***I would like to welcome the results of the recent IBAL study which shows Limerick ‘Clean to***

***European Norms’. However, there are s**till areas which require action and I would request***

***that adequate funding be provided in the forthcoming budget for clean ups of such areas so***

***that we can maintain and improve our status in future surveys.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Prendiville.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller noted the importance of focusing on the positive

elements of the IBAL study and complimented Colbert Station in this regard. He noted however

the need for action in relation to basements at O’Connell Street and at the Galvone Business

Park where consideration should be given to blocking access to dumping areas.

**REPLY:**

The Council has noted the results and the findings of the IBAL study. We

consistently review and examine work programmes in areas such as street

cleaning with a view to identifying priorities and developing programmes of work

to meet these priorities.

The issue of funding to support these priority works will be considered by the

Members and Executive in the context of the preparation, consideration and

adoption of the 2017 Annual Budget.

The budget process represents an opportunity for the Members of Council to

identify and agree priority works and to ensure that adequate funding is available

to deliver on these priorities.

It is my intention to ensure that a comprehensive, fully costed programme of

works in respect of areas such as street cleaning is placed before the Members of

Council for consideration.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that, given the huge pressure on student accommodation in***

***the Metropolitan area, a meeting is organised between council officials, councillors and the***

***different third level institutes and their students unions to discuss what can be done to provide***

***more affordable, quality student accommodation in the district.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that pressure on demand for student

accommodation was focused mainly in the area around University of Limerick, leading to

increases in rents and deposits. He highlighted the need for rent control measures, linked to

inflation, and the provision of additional student accommodation.

Members supported the motion and the potential of the Horizon site to be used to provide

student accommodation was discussed.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is supportive of establishing a forum to afford

an opportunity for the different sectors to exchange views on the challenges and

opportunities relating to student accommodation in Limerick.

The recently launched ‘Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and

Homelessness’ (July 2016) recognises “the unmet demand of about 25,000

student bed spaces nationally” and the Government commits to key actions

relating to Student Accommodation under Strategic Pillar 4: Improve the Rental

Sector, as follows:

 Publish by Q2 2017 a National Student Accommodation Strategy, which will

set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of

accommodation and which will inform local authority housing strategies and

the land management process.

 Work with stakeholders (Q4 2016 – initial assessment, 2017-2019) to

prioritise and progress viable projects to provide additional student

accommodation in key urban areas.

 Establish dedicated delivery structures by Q1 2017, such as AHBs in the

Higher Education Institutions (HEI) sector to access Housing Finance Agency

funding, and complete any required policy, regulatory or legislative changes

necessary.

 Establish funding mechanisms by Q4 2016 for Institutes of Technology to

support the development of their student accommodation capacity.

 Carry out an assessment by Q4 2016 of scope for provision of additional

student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands.

 Enable student accommodation projects for 100 units or more to go straight

to An Bord Pleanála, as well as maximise the opportunities for joint venture

projects on local authority sites to proceed through the Part 8 process and

prepare guidance on planning policies around student accommodation

developments by Q3/Q4 2016.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors John Gilligan and Frankie Daly**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council return to its Elected Members the €150,000 of***

***discretionary funding granted to it under Better Local Government.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Daly.

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan noted a decision to allocate 2015 GMA funding to

Caherdavin and sought clarity as to why similar funding was being included in the 2016 GMA.

In seconding the motion Councillor Daly highlighted other projects in need of funding.

The Director, Physical Development noted the high number of insurance claims received in

relation to trips and falls, the ongoing need for footpath repairs and commitment given to

applying GMA funding to same. He stressed the need for clear policy and procedures in relation

to the allocation of GMA funding and undertook to seek to resolve the issue raised by the

motion.

**Item 2: Presentation by the Director of Service of the Physical Development Directorate**

Mr. Lehane explained that the Physical Development Directorate has responsibility for

policy in the areas of Environment and Travel/Transportation. He suggested that some

consideration be given to merging these SPC’s given they are under the same Directorate.

He stated that the purpose of the Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) is to develop and

recommend policy to the Full Council for consideration and approval. He confirmed that the

Members may face challenges such as securing and allocating resources and that as a result

making policy involves difficult decision making.

**Item 3: Consideration of policy issues**

***(A)**Presentation on the current Travel and Transport challenges and opportunities.***

***(B)**Consideration of important infrastructural developments***

Mr Lehane delivered a presentation on the current travel and transportation challenges and

opportunities, namely - Roads 2016 Reforms, Challenges and Safety – A National

Perspective.

He explained that the Council needs to work with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and

the National Transport Agency (NTA) for the purpose of securing funding in order to

progress schemes in Limerick.

He stated that it is important that Limerick is well connected, and he highlighted the need

for the M20. It is imperative to have “shovel ready schemes” prepared in order to take

advantage of the increased capital funding that is likely to be available in the coming years

and there is an onus on the Council to progress proposals. He confirmed that there are a

number of important proposed roads projects that would alleviate traffic congestion in

Limerick.

The Members emphasised the importance of Regional and Local Roads Investment in

facilitating industry and creating employment and agreed that the Council must position

itself to take advantage of the possible funding increase in the years ahead.

The Members agreed that roads open up land for development and that the Northern

Distributor Road would facilitate access to the National Technology Park, Moyross, Corbally

and other areas and provide greater connectivity. The Members noted that this project

would serve the increasing demands for access to the University of Limerick where it is

anticipated that there will be a large increase in the number of students over the next ten

years.

The Members raised the issue of traffic congestion in a number of areas such as Abbeyfeale,

Adare and Newcastle West and the insufficient access from the M7 to Janesboro.---
Mr Lehane acknowledged that the issue of traffic congestion in Abbeyfeale has been raised

previously and stated that the proposed Adare-Foynes motorway may offer a quicker route

for some people depending on their destination. It was noted that following submissions a

narrower route corridor for the Adare bypass scheme would be published shortly and that

this would help to advance the scheme to the next phase.

In relation to urban congestion, it will be necessary for access to UL, LIT and North Limerick

that the Members agree to give planning approval to the proposed Northern Distributor

Road.

**Item 4: Long Term Strategy for Traffic Calming and Safe Street Network Design**

The Senior Engineer confirmed that the Council is at the start of the process to develop a

Traffic Calming Strategy. He stated that the nature of many areas may have changed since

the construction of the road network and that accordingly, retro –fitting may be required.

He pointed out that in doing so, it will be necessary to take account of all road users.

The Members endorsed that policies and proposals to deal with traffic congestion be

developed and that the necessary resources be granted for same.

**Item 5: Presentation by the Senior Engineer** **–** **2016 Roads Budgets June 2016**

Mr Brennan made a presentation on the 2016 Roads Budgets.

In response to queries from the Members, Mr Brennan stated that the Roads Maintenance

Office will take over the licensing of road works, that the €2.5 million allocation for lighting

was provision for the maintenance of the lights we currently have.

The issue of accessible transport for people with disabilities was raised. It was pointed out

there was greater flexibility with some rural bus routes and that some bus companies do not

have wheelchair access on its buses.

**Item 6: Any Other Business**

Cllr Daly suggested that the Committee write to the Minister for Transport requesting that

funding be provided for the proposed M20 Motorway. The under listed Motion was then

proposed by Cllr Donegan and seconded by Cllr O’ Donoghue and unanimously agreed.

***That the Committee unanimously agreed that the Council write to the Minister for***

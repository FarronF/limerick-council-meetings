QUESTIONS

7. Question submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

| will ask at the next Meeting for a directive from Roads Engineers in relation to school buses
using 3-ton roads around the District. At present school buses are restricted and are forced to
divert to use alternative (sub-standard) routes to collect and drop-off school children.

REPLY: Under the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, article 17 sub article
2, an exemption is provided for vehicles such as school buses to travel upon a road
that has a weight restriction on it, where it is necessary for the vehicle to enter the
road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible
only from that road.

This question has also been referred to the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and the
Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for further clarity.

West Road Design Office at how this decision was communicated and at how those affected by

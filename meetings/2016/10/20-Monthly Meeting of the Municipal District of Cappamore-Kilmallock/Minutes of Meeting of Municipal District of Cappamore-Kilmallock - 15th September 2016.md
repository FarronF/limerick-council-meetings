The Senior Executive Officer stated that it was the intention of Limerick City and County Council

to undertake a pilot project to introduce a 30 km/hr special speed limit in 30 housing estates.

This Special Speed Limit would be introduced through the making of Special Speed Limit Bye-

Laws under Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004. The adoption of such bye-laws, he

explained, was a function reserved to the Elected Members of the Council.

He stated that the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee had agreed that a 30

km/hr special speed limit be introduced initially in 5 estates in each Municipal District and in 15

estates in the Metropolitan District (5 per electoral area).

He explained the process by which the Special Speed Limit Bye-Laws would be introduced:

Stage 1 – Pre-Draft Consultation

Stage 2 – Public Consultation.

Stage 3 – Presentation to Full Council

The Senior Executive Officer explained that he was seeking approval for the Council to prepare

draft bye-laws and commence the public consultation phase in relation to the estates listed

hereunder:

 Glenfield, Kilmallock

 Radharc na Coille, Kilmallock

 Sycamore Drive, Bruff

 Galtee View, Hospital

 Glenview Drive, Hospital

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that it had been previously agreed that the housing

estates, Glenfield and Radharc na Coille, Kilmallock were considered to be one estate and

Galtee View and Glenview Drive, Hospital were also considered to be one estate. He asserted

that including Sycamore Drive, Bruff this amounted to three estates and therefore Ceol na

hAbhann, Caherconlish and Ros Fearna / The Meadows, Murroe should also be included in the

Pilot Project.

Members thanked the Senior Executive Officer for his presentation and welcomed the

proposal.

Councillor Sheehy stated that a motion in relation to reducing speed limits to 20km/hr had

been approved by the Travel and Transportation SPC and the Senior Executive Officer agreed to

clarify the position and revert to Members.

On the proposal of Councillor Teefy, seconded by Councillor Donegan, it was agreed to adopt

the Scheme, subject to the inclusion of the housing estates Ceol na hAbhann, Caherconlish and

***We will move at the next Meeting that the outdoor staff who have retired in recent years and***

***those who will be retiring shortly be replaced immediately as staff numbers are at a critical***

***level in the area.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Teefy expressed grave concern at the number of staff that

had retired and were expected to retire in the coming years and were not being replaced. The

motion was seconded by Councillor Gleeson who stressed the need to have additional staff

appointed. Members supported the motion. Members also paid tribute to existing staff and

acknowledged the work carried out in difficult circumstances.

**REPLY**:

It is acknowledged that staffing numbers are a critical issue in terms of service

delivery within the organisation. This is something that is monitored on an on-

going basis.

To alleviate pressures identified, the Human Resources Department has

embarked on the creation of recruitment panels across a large number of

positions within the organisation including that of General Operative. The

creation of such panels allows the organisation to recruit staff without

unnecessary delay and ensure critical services are delivered without negatively

impacting communities.

In the current year, a total of 22 General Operatives have been recruited on a

temporary seasonal basis across the Council for the period April to October,

2016. 11 of those General Operatives have been assigned to the North and

South Divisions. It is envisaged that Limerick City and County Council will

permanently appoint 11 Driver General Operatives from an existing panel by

year end and that a further 5 General Operatives will be appointed permanently

following completion of a competition which is currently underway within the

Council.

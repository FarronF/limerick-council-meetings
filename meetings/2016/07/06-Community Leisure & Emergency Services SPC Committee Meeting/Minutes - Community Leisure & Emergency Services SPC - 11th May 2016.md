**Item 3:**

**Share a Dream Foundation** **–** **(Presentation by Mr. Shay Kinsella)**

Ciara Brolly and Shane Kinsella from the Share a Dream Foundation were in attendance at

the meeting. Ms Brolly gave a brief introduction and Mr Kinsella followed on with a

presentation on their newest project – the development of an all inclusive fun centre for the

children they support and their extended families. Located at the Park Point on the Dublin

Road, he added that it would also be available to other users and is the first initiative of its

kind in the country.
---
The Chairperson endorsed the project and commended the foundation for all the good work

they have done to date. He also expressed thanks to Cllr Secas for organising this very

worthwhile presentation.

Cllr Secas responded by thanking the Chairperson and the committee for listening. She

suggested it could be included in the Compassionate Cities initiave which was recently

launched in the Council.

Cllr Sheehy thanked Mr Kinsella for his passionate presentation and suggested that this

presentation should be given to the full Council at a later date to increase its profile further.

Cllr Hurley added her support of the project but cautioned that there were wider implications

in relation to insurance and other running costs when a centre is open to the general public.

Mr Kinsella assured her that these had been factored in and it is hoped that the monies being

charged to other users would cover a large portion of the operational costs.

**Item 4:**

**Update on Suicide Strategy**

Cllr Sheehy outlined the issues arising from the meeting earlier in the afternoon of the

Suicide Prevention Sub-Committee. She stated that the committee wish to expand their brief

from a sub committee to a working group of the full council to allow more people to join. It

has also been decided that the group would focus on one topic per meeting to allow more in

depth debate on the chosen subject, she added.

She expressed concerns at the level of services currently available in the area of mental health

and suggested that the Council write to the Minister regarding this.

The services are too slow at present, she stated with the waiting list for ASIST training in

Limerick being a case in point with the need for HSE to be contacted in relation to this.

**Item 5:**

**New Operating Model** **–** **Update**

Mr Dowling gave a brief outline of the new structures now in place in the Council and

pointed out that revised structure was unique to the Council. He said it represented a new way

of delivering services which he was confident would lead to the delivery of better services

ultimately to the general public and all other users of ourl services.

**Item 6:**

**Local Economic Community Plan**

Ms Humphries gave a presentation on the draft Limerick Local Economic & Community

Plan (LECP). As part of her presentation she outlined the background, the evidence base for

the LECP, its policy fit and type of plan. She also outlined the high level goals, the overall

structure and content and the timeline for the next steps of the LECP,

Some of the emerging issues identified to date include the need for investment in rural

infrastructure particularly broadband.

Cllr Hurley suggested there was a shift in the rural areas from community centres to local

pubs but she wondered where will people meet in the future now that pubs are closing down

as well?

Ms Humphries responded by pointing out there are new ways of doing things emerging and

Broadford is a good example. She suggested we should be looking at revitalising derelict

buildings in rural villages and towns and that the needs of our aging population should be

factored in to all plans, city and county alike.
---
Ms. Vaughan Mullane pointed out that every small derelict building is used abroad. She

asked how can we do this in Ireland? We need a town Mayor or Co-ordinator to drive this,

she added and volunteerism is not as strong as it was and there is a risk of losing the unique

local spirit. Some of the traditional skills such as sewing and cooking will be lost if some

form of supplementary funding is not provided for those working in these areas.

.

Ms Humphries agreed that it is harder to find people to run anything locally even though

there are high levels of education in the rural areas with 80% progressing to third level.

Cllr Teefy pointed out that agriculture is still the driving force in the economy and we need a

mix of ages in rural areas to ensure their future. She added that the local sporting

organisations need more support.

Cllr K Sheahan suggested that we need to learn from our past and get more balanced

regional investment and get more people back working. He further suggested consideration

should be given to the development of small clusters of rural housing developments to assist

the revitalisation of the rural economy.

**Item 7:**

**Any Other Business**

The Chairperson expressed his thanks to Dara McGuigan for all the hard work he has done to

date for the SPC. He then introduced Geraldine Dollard to the members and welcomed her

onto the committee.

It was suggested that the next meeting would be held outside of the city subject to availability

of venue. Cllr Mitchell offered to host the next meeting in Hospital Community Centre.

The date of the next meeting to be advised at a later date.

QUESTIONS

uestion submitt incill Ivi

1 will ask at the next Meeting (a) for a detailed report/discussion on the Great Southern Trail
footpath in Abbeyfeale; (b) investment in the crossings; (c) signage on the N21 and on the line
itself;(d) update on the Website; (e) what Directorate does it come under and who has
responsibility; (f) what grants have been drawn down; (g) what is the budget for maintenance.

Rural Recreation funding of €82,708 was approved in December 2014 to undertake remedial
works on the Great Southern Trail (GST). These works included amongst others the
improvement of crossings, signage, development of specific town land signage and seating.
An alternative, less costly crossing option was trialled in 2015 but this did not prove
suitable. Consultants were engaged during 2015 to develop designs and specifications for
the improvement works identified. The crossings are currently being installed and other
works related to signage will be undertaken following the completion of a Design Guide for

the GST.

Rural Recreation funding was sought in 2015 for the footpath in Abbeyfeale but this
funding was not allocated owing to the re-allocation of this funding to flood related
emergency works. The Great Southern Trail is currently under the responsibility of a number
of different Directorates including both Economic Development and the Service Operations
Directorate. A review of the necessary operational structures required to advance the
development of the GST is underway.

NOTICES OF MOTION

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

1 will move at the next Meeting that a bus bay be provided at Barnagh, east bound, to cater for
pedestrians getting on or off to use the Great Southern Trail.

Councillor Galvin in proposing the Motion stated that to access the Great Southern Trail it
was not safe for visitors to cross the main road from the other side where there was a

parking area.
Seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY: This matter has been investigated and it has been determined that the provision of a
bus stop at the above location would create a safety hazard on the down slope on
the east bound route towards Newcastle West. As this is a 100 kmph National Road,
any bus whether pulling in or pulling out of any potential parking bay would
introduce a safety risk to both the bus and any affected traffic. Accordingly, it is not
considered appropriate to provide the bus bay as requested.

group/committee, may be more appropriate.
Seconded by Councillor Foley.

Killarney Pole to Barnagh Road Safety Scheme have been reinstated at suitable and
safe locations away from the busy national road but as close to the original locations

Community Initiative Scheme 2016

Chief Officer, Limerick Local Community Development Committee was in attendance at the
Meeting and gave a brief outline of allocations made under the 2015 Scheme. A short discussion
took place and it was agreed to defer the matter as further information was required by the
Members before allocations for 2016 could be considered. On the proposal of Councillor
Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Foley it was agreed to hold a Special Meeting of the District to
be held “in committee” on Wednesday, 29" June, 2016 at 10.30 a.m.

Changing of Name of “The Square”, Newcastle West.

The Meetings Administrator outlined the legislation governing the change of name of a Square
which she said was contained in the Local Government Act, 1946 (as amended by the Local
Government Act, 1955 and the Local Government Act, 1994). She further explained that
Members of the Full Council must pass a resolution agreeing to change the name of The Square
and then the Council must hold a plebisite of those who were classified as “Qualified Electors".
Qualified Electors was every person who wasa registered Elector on the register of Local
Government Electors or was the rated occupier.

The Meetings Administrator went on to state that the legislation would appear to only allow
those who were occupying the houses or business premises to have a vote. Therefore,
for owners of buildings in The Square, who had the premises rented out, it was only the tenant
who would have a say and not the registered owner of the premises.

She stated that a Motion to change the name of The Square would have to be passed by the Full
Council. In this regard, a Motion could be submitted to the July Meeting of the Full Council from
the Municipal District to propose the change of name and to commence the process.

Members congratulated Deputy Patrick O’Donovan on his appointment as Minister for Tourism and
Sport and asked for their good wishes to be conveyed to him ina letter.

Vote of Sympathy

A Vote of Sympathy was extended to Brian Kennedy and the Kennedy family on the death of his
father John (Jack) Kennedy. A minute's silence was observed as a mark of respect.

This concluded the Meeting.

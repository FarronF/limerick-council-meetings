The outgoing Mayor, Councillor Galvin, opened the Meeting by giving the following address:

**“Colleagues, Chief Executive, Senator, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to**

**begin by acknowledging the support you have given me over the past 12**

**months during my term as Mayor of the City and County of Limerick. The role**

**of Mayor is an historic one that goes back centuries and throughout the year, I**

**have been honoured to serve you and the people of Limerick in this**

**prestigious office.**

**I depart the role with some wonderful memories that will stay with me for the**

**rest of my life. Admittedly, the past 12 months have been a real eye opener for**

**me as Mayor. I have visited every corner of the County and City in my capacity**

**as Mayor and I have learned a lot about how individual communities are**

**working hard to enhance their home villages and towns. The community spirit**

**and pride of place on display throughout Limerick is a credit to these**

**communities. Limerick is a vibrant place with countless individuals and local**

**groups with bright ideas and positive attitudes to making things happen. This**

**has especially been evident during the past year in the way that communities**

**have supported the 1916 Commemoration Programme, and participated in**

**initiatives such as Team Limerick Cleanup, Pride of Place and Tidy Towns.** **It**
---

**was great to see that Limerick City and County Council continued to support and**

**recognise those who contribute so valuably and selflessly to community life in**

**Limerick. I had the pleasure of officiating at the presentation of awards in community**

**schemes such as Limerick Going for Gold, the Burial Ground Awards and The Golden**

**Mile Awards.**

**It gave me great pleasure during the year to award Civic Receptions to a**

**number of organisations and individuals around Limerick including the**

**victorious All Ireland winning Na Piarsaigh hurlers, as well as the County's**

**Under 21 team. A highlight for me during the year was witnessing at first-hand**

**the work of our three large educational institutions - the University of Limerick,**

**Mary Immaculate College and Limerick Institute of Technology. I have been on**

**the Governing Authority of the University of Limerick and the work that is**

**carried out in Plassey is phenomenal. All three institutions are a credit to**

**Limerick. The huge amount of highly qualified graduates in Limerick is an**

**important feature in the Region's growing attractiveness as a destination for**

**inward investment from global, technical, and other companies.**

**Businesses from inside and outside of Ireland are now viewing Limerick with a**

**fresh eye as ongoing investment has transformed the city centre with the**

**arrival of more than 30 new retailers in the past 12 months. Not only is Limerick**

**becoming a key European hub for inward investment; its start-up business**

**scene also is buoyant and many companies are ‘spinning’ into Limerick as**

**they expand. Central to this is the energetic and positive business**

**environment being developed in Limerick. I want to commend the Council and**

**its Elected Members for the lead role they are taking in fostering partnership**

**approaches to promoting entrepreneurship and start-ups in the Region. We**

**want Limerick to be the best place to start a business in Ireland. I can clearly**

**see from the work of the likes of the Local Enterprise Office that there is a**

**great energy level there for start-ups. Most importantly, the Limerick 2030**

**Vision has caught the imagination of the business community and it has**

**energised the public and private sector in Limerick. Long may this continue.**

**I want to pay a special tribute to the Council staff who have shown a great level**

**of commitment to their role in administering services for the people of**

**Limerick. The recent severe weather event demonstrated the scale and**

**importance of the role played by Council staff.** **Council staff, both indoor and**

**outdoor, worked around the clock during December and January, including**

**during the Christmas holiday period, to strengthen flood defences and support**

**property owners affected by flooding along the Lower River Shannon.** **Their**

**contribution to the response efforts was admirable.**

**The efficient** **delivery of Local Government services is key to this country’s**

**economic recovery. So, too, is the ability of workers within this sector to**

**provide such services. Working closely with the various Sections of the**

**Council, I can see that Limerick is well served and that the wider public** **is very**

**appreciative of your valuable contribution.**

**Once again, I wish to thank each and every one of my fellow Elected**

**Representatives for the courtesy and support they have shown me in the last**

**year.**
---

**I also want to thank the Chief Executive, Conn Murray, and his Management**

**Team who have been of tremendous assistance during my term as Mayor.**

**Finally, I want to thank Marianne O'Reilly and the Corporate Services team who**

**have kept me on my toes throughout the year. Also, I want to acknowledge the**

**support of my wife, Catriona, during the past 12 months.**

**I will look back on my term as Mayor of Limerick with great affection but all**

**good things must come to an end. On that note, I wish the incoming Mayor the**

**very best for the year ahead.**

**Go raibh mile maith agaibh go léir. Thank You."**

For Councillor Sheehy

Councillors Browne, Costelloe, Loftus, McCreesh, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, Sheehy, (6)

For Councillor Prendiville

Councillors Gilligan, Keller, Prendiville. (3)

The outgoing Mayor declared Councillor O’Hanlon elected as Mayor of the City and County

of Limerick and congratulated him on his election.

The incoming Mayor, Councillor O’Hanlon, gave the following address to the Meeting:

**“Outgoing Mayor Liam Galvin, Deputy Mayor Gerald Mitchell, fellow**

**Councillors, Senator, Chief Executive Conn Murray, members of the Executive,**

**this is one of the proudest days of my political career.**

**I’ve had the privilege of being ‘Mayor of Limerick’ before, albeit Mayor of**

**Limerick City. It was too a very proud moment for me, because I was the 800th**

**Mayor of Limerick City. It is difficult to believe that was all of 20 years ago but**

**the only rule for ageing I apply is that birthdays are good for you and the**

**people who have the most of them live the longest!**

**Today, the privilege is even greater than it was in 1996 because, of course, our**

**City and County have come together. Today we are all under the one flag,**

**moving together in strength and purpose in what is truly a remarkable time for**

**our City and County.**

**Events of the last week have dramatically changed the political mood of the**

**moment. I now take on this role at a very sensitive time for politics, for the**

**economy generally as a result of the Brexit result. At this stage it is impossible**

**to quantify exactly what the impact of this vote will be on us here in Limerick**

**but we do need a period of calm to carefully analyse the implications. There**

**will be challenges, for sure, for all of us but also opportunities. What we need**

**to do now is carefully analyse where both these are and take whatever steps**

**we can to make sure Limerick is best positioned to make the most of this new**

**European context and, indeed, our relationship with the UK.**

**We differ quite often in this Chamber and that is the health of politics and**

**democracy. But what we all agree on is that Limerick has embarked on a great**

**new era. If you think back only a few years to the start of the decade, this was,**

**indeed, a different place, a different climate. Limerick was a city under the grip**

**of a national and global recession but with unique problems of its own. But to**

**quote the American writer Dale Carnegie,** ***‘Most of the important things in the***

***world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there***

***seemed to be no hope at all. ‘***

**We needed leadership and we were lucky to have it in abundance. We have**

**had it politically, we have had it in Local Government through our Members**

**and, indeed, our Executive. We have had it regionally in key stakeholders with**

**so many, from our Third Level Institutions, to Shannon Foynes Port Company**

**– an entity I am proud to say I am a former Board Member and Acting Chairman**

**of – and, of course, Shannon Airport, which I call on all Limerick people to**

**support; all moving forward with vision and feeding into a greater and positive**

**story that Limerick is today.**

**Whether it is in politics, local government, business, whatever, you will only**

**truly succeed when you have a vision. Our vision is** ***Limerick 2030 - An***

***Economic and Spatial Plan for the City and County.*** **It is a plan, a framework, a**

**roadmap that is helping to transform Limerick, its economy, and the way it is**

**marketed as an ideal location over the coming 14 years and beyond.**

**I congratulate Conn Murray and his team on this and I look forward to working**

**with them to continue the momentum and ensure we go further down the road**

**of this visionary plan, to ensure that we continue to prosper as a City and**

**County and that this growth in prosperity presents opportunity for ALL our**

**citizens, without exception, to improve their lot. The economic development of**

**Limerick is a central pillar of Limerick 2030 and it has already reaped very**

**significant dividends, with over 7,000 jobs announced for Limerick since the**

**beginning of 2013. That is worth repeating - 7,000 jobs announced for our City**

**and County. Six years ago that rate of job creation would have been almost**

**unthinkable.**

**And we are building for the future – literally. We have some very ambitious**

**programmes planned that will re-energise Limerick, not least here in the city**

**centre with the Hanging Gardens, Arthurs Quay and Opera Centre projects**

**which will create huge employment in the construction stage and thereafter.**

**You will, indeed, hear some voices in Limerick’s Regeneration Areas claiming**

**that they have not felt this warm wind of change. But it is undeniable that we**

**have a transformative €300m Limerick Regeneration Plan underway. It has**

**reaped very significant social dividends already in these areas and now there**

**is tangible and visible evidence of physical change, with modern new, fit-for-**

**purpose housing developments and social facilities already completed, under**

**construction or in advance stage of planning.**

**We have come a long way with regard to the regeneration programme but have**

**a good distance yet to travel. However, one thing we cannot allow to happen is**

**to take our foot off the policing pedal. Our Gardaí in Limerick have done**

**remarkable work in smashing the grip that gangland activity had here and we**

**need to ensure they continue to win this fight. It is imperative that Limerick**

**gets the resources necessary so that people in the regeneration areas can**

**continue to enjoy this rebirth of their localities and live in peace and harmony.**

**As referenced earlier, thanks to the amalgamation, our focus is on County as**

**well as City. We have witnessed much investment in facilities and services**

**throughout the County, which will continue to be a key focus for me as Mayor.**

**My two predecessors as Mayors have both been from the County and I am**

**equally determined to ensure the spread of this remarkable recovery in**

**Limerick is felt in every corner of our proud County. In addition to being on the**
---

**Board of Shannon Foynes Port Company, I worked in West Limerick for 30**

**years, in Wyeth in Askeaton, so I know just how essential it is for us to ensure**

**the growth is spread across the County.**

**Looking ahead to the next twelve months, my ultimate goal is to ensure that**

**the incredible momentum built up by Limerick over the past number of years is**

**maintained and even grown. That momentum has been collectively generated**

**across so many areas, from economic development to cultural expression.**

**Indeed, with regard to the latter, there has been an extraordinary amplification**

**of our cultural heritage over recent years. It was given stunning voice in 2014**

**when Limerick became Ireland’s first National City of Culture, resulting in a**

**greater national and international appreciation of just how diverse and rich our**

**culture is.**

**We are now, of course, in the final and exciting furlong of the European Capital**

**of Culture 2020 selection process, having already made the shortlist.**

**Thankfully, our 2014 National City of Culture programme was by no means a**

**year in isolation as it has led to a great flowering of our culture ever since,**

**right through the 2020 European Capital of Culture bid process. Collectively,**

**the 2014 designation and 2020 bid have given the new and emerging Limerick a**

**platform for celebrating, through cultural expression, who and what we are as**

**a City and County. Critically also, that platform has encouraged so many who**

**heretofore may have felt they had no voice, or that no one would listen to it,**

**onto a grand stage to parade their cultural talents and be fully appreciated for**

**them. That has been one of its greatest and most abiding legacies of this**

**period. There is a renewed pride in who we are and we are not just encouraged**

**but willing to sing from the rooftops about it.**

**Over the coming week or so, and not least on Monday and Tuesday next when**

**the adjudicators on the European Capital of Culture competition are in town,**

**we want to let the judges know just how proud we are of our City and County,**

**what Limerick will do for this designation and, indeed, what this designation**

**will do for Limerick. So, I would urge every business, indeed every person, to**

**ensure Limerick’s best foot is forward and that we continue to dance over the**

**coming eight days and beyond as a City and County and bring home what**

**would be a much deserved and appreciated European Capital of Culture 2020**

**designation.**

**Within the cultural space, I believe that we have an opportunity and obligation**

**to develop Limerick’s offering in traditional Irish music and song. We have a**

**proud tradition in** **this aspect of our culture. The late Ciarán Mac Mathúna,**

**Limerick, was one of Ireland’s foremost influencers in the renaissance of Irish**

**music in the ‘60s and ‘70s. I think it is long overdue that we honour Ciarán** **for**

**his contribution to Irish music in Limerick, nationally and internationally, and**

**over the next twelve months also I would like to see us move towards**

**developing a traditional music weekend in Limerick like there is in Milltown**

**Malbay for Willie Clancy. Furthermore, it would be a fitting tribute to Ciarán**

**and all in Limerick who champion traditional music, song and dance if we were**

**to host the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann here in 2020 when hopefully we will be**

**the European Capital of Culture.**

**Another major goal of mine for the coming year is that we progress our**

**twinning arrangement with Boston in the US. I intend to lead a delegation with**

**fellow Councillors on behalf of the local authority that will also include**
---
7

**representatives of Limerick Chamber, Third Level stakeholders and An Garda**

**Síochaná in Limerick, which has links with the Massachusetts State Police. As**

**Chairman of COMHALTAS GARRAÍ EOIN, I am delighted that it, too, will be**

**joining us on this delegation. They already have strong ties with the Boston**

**Comhaltas Group and can help us further our wider links with the City of**

**Boston. They are busy fund-raising for this and are appealing to the business**

**community, in particular, for support – support they fully deserve and I have no**

**doubt they will get. While I am on this, I wish to extend a warm invitation to all**

**to attend their special 1916 celebration on Thursday night next at Richmond**

**Rugby Club at 8p.m.**

**Generally with regard to the 100th** **anniversary commemorations of 1916, this**

**has been a proud year for Limerick as we have celebrated our deep links with**

**that historic uprising. As part of our own events here in Limerick City and**

**County Council to mark 1916, I intend to have a reception here for all Members,**

**Mayors and Chairs as well as Managers, of the Local Authority.**

**I would like to take this opportunity also to congratulate Patrick O’Donovan,**

**T.D., on his recent appointment as Minister for Sport. It is only right that**

**Limerick, with its sporting heritage, would hold this Ministry and I intend to**

**find a fitting way to congratulate Patrick and pay tribute to this achievement.**

**From an administration level, the amalgamation of Limerick City and County**

**Councils has been an unqualified success and huge credit to all involved for**

**making that happen – the Executive, Staff, Members and, indeed, the Public.**

**But it hasn’t come about without challenges and in many ways we are still**

**adapting. Certainly, as Councillors, there is room for improvement and by this**

**I am thinking particularly about the way we do our business, the amount of**

**meetings we have, the duration of those meetings and what we discuss at**

**them. There are issues that unmistakably fall under our remit but, from time to**

**time, we end up discussing matters we have no control over. I intend to meet**

**with each Party and Councillor over the next two months to come up with a**

**plan that will benefit Councillors and the general public and ultimately ensure**

**we do our business more efficiently.**

**Finally, I think over the coming 12 months as the completion of the motorway**

**from Limerick to Galway advances, there is a need for a greater conversation**

**than heretofore with regard to how Limerick and Galway can work closer**

**together in the national and regional interest. Likewise, there should be an**

**opportunity to complete a motorway corridor that will run from Galway to**

**Limerick and onto Cork but we need to get that final leg to Cork back on the**

**capital spending programme with a review of the Government’s Capital**

**Investment Plan. It is a statement of Limerick’s success that we are no longer**

**looking within and trying to fix problems but we are now looking outwardly and**

**how we can grow even further. The Limerick of the future is all about growth,**

**about leaving further in the rear-view mirror the stereotype of the past decade.**

**We have a dynamic, successful and rapidly growing economy and I look**

**forward to doing my part to ensure that in 12 months’ time we will have gone**

**even further down the road to becoming a major driver of regional and national**

**economic prosperity.”**

a community person and acknowledged the vast work that was being undertaken by

competitions such as the Tidy Towns Awards and Going for Gold. He said that he was

colleagues, as representatives of communities the length and breadth of Limerick. During

successful year. He also extended his appreciation to the outgoing Deputy Mayor of the City

and County, Councillor Mitchell.

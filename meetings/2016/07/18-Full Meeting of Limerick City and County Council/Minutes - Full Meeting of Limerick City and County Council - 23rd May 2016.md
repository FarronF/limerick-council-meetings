Arising from the Minutes of Adjourned Meeting of the Council held on 23rd March,

2016, some Members expressed their disappointment that the briefing which they had

requested with officials in relation to the proposed development at Irish Cement had not

taken place. It was noted that the proposed development included both a planning

application to the Council and a licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency

(EPA).

In response to issues raised by the Members, the Senior Planner clarified the

following:

• Two e-mails had been sent by the Meetings Administrator to the Elected Members prior

to the Council Meeting explaining the EPA licence process with guidance documents

produced by the EPA and, in particular, information on how the public could make a

submission. It was noted that clarification had also been given on the planning process

at the Meeting of the Metropolitan District which had been held prior to the Full Council

Meeting.

• Two separate legislative provisions applied to the proposed development - namely the

Planning and Development Act and the EPA Act.

• Explanation was given in relation to the two processes and how the public could make

submissions either to the Planning Authority or to the EPA.

• There was no provision within the Planning legislation for the Planning Authority to

facilitate a meeting to allow/provide public consultation on a specific planning

application. The legislation indicated that the public should be informed of a proposed

development, with the erection of site notices at the site and the publication of a

newspaper notice in an approved newspaper. Submissions from the general public could

then be received by the Planning Authority for a period of five weeks.

• In relation to the review of an Industrial Emission Licence, this was under the

responsibility of the EPA, the Council (the Executive) and the public could make a

submission to the EPA.

In response to a query from the Members, it was pointed out that a submission in

relation to review of the licence could be made by the Elected Members as a Body and that

they could be facilitated in the development of that submission.

expenditure was greater than budget.

• This additional expenditure could be summarised into the following categories:

(a)Expenditure in excess of Budget with matching income

For example: Service B04 Local Roads – additional expenditure matched by

additional income received.

(b)Expenditure in excess of Budget with no matching income

For example: Service E04 Provision of Waste to Collection Service – additional

expenditure of €173k on Refuse Waiver Scheme.

-

Efficiencies (e.g. back-office costs).

-

Opportunities (e.g. HAP Shared Service Centre).

Arising from queries raised by the Members, the A/Head of Finance clarified the

following:

• The increase in the level of HAP landlord payments compared to 2014 explained the

significant variance in Revenue expenditure.

• Legacy claims - still outstanding claims but these had now been provided for in the

accounts.

provision, corporate building programme.

The report stated that in line with Circular letter FIN 03/2009 dated 13th February,

2009, from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which

related to the ‘Control and Monitoring of Local Authorities Contribution to the General

Government Balance’ (GGB),” it was a requirement that the proposed expenditure be in line

with estimated collection for the year. Development Contribution total income of €1.75m

net (excluding water services infrastructure) had been budgeted for 2016 and the

expenditure proposals were set out accordingly.

The monies outlined in the report were to be collected under the various

Development Contribution Schemes adopted by Limerick City Council and Limerick County

Council and were specific to the area in which they were to be collected. Consequently,

€1.4m was proposed to be assigned in the ‘old’ County area and €0.35m in the ‘old’ City

area.

Eighty-two projects with a value of €27.8m had been put forward for consideration

for funding. The Council was in a position to allocate funding to 30 projects/initiatives. The

criteria for assessment of projects included: meeting the City/County split, and
---
13

apportioning the funds across the Transport, Recreation/Amenity, and Community/Ancillary

areas as set out in the various Contribution Schemes.

The €1.75m figure was an estimate based on what the Council believed would be

collected from development contributions during 2016.

A sum of €200,000 was to be made available to assist with the taking-in-charge of a

number of named housing estates throughout the City and County. That money would be

used in conjunction with monies received from the drawdown of bonds in order to bring

such unfinished estates up to the minimum standards.

The report went on to outline a number of areas where funding had been allocated

and gave a full breakdown of the proposed allocations.

In noting the allocations, the Members raised queries in relation to the following:

• Cois na Féile, Abbeyfeale/footpath.

• Proposed works at the Market Square, Newcastle West.

• Ballyneety Golf Course.

the project. The planning application for the development of the site would be before the

Metropolitan District for decision at its June Meeting. In the meantime, preliminary work

on the conservation aspects of the project were underway and the timeline for full

construction was on target for September 2016.

The report stated that the advancement of the Hanging Gardens project, along with

the other specified strategic sites outlined in Limerick 2030, was essential to the economic

transformation of Limerick. In that regard, there remained an urgent need to move to

identify viable uses and advance movement on the remaining strategic locations: Cleeves

Site, Colbert Station Phase ll, Opera Site and the Georgian area.

ADJOURNED NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

I will move at the next Meeting that we welcome the reports that water charges and Irish

Water may now be abolished, and write to the new Minister for the Environment, when

appointed, calling on him to cancel outstanding bills and make a refund available to those

who paid under protest.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Prendiville called on the incoming Minister to

cancel all outstanding bills and to refund those who had paid. He added that the issue of

water charges was not over and pointed out that over 1 million households were in arrears.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keller.
---
17

Councillor Sheahan (J) proposed the following Motion and this was seconded by

Councillor Hourigan:

“That, we in the Fine Gael Group move to welcome the appointment of Minister

Simon Coveney who has responsibility for Irish Water and Local Government; in light

of the review that has been initiated under the Confidence and Supply Agreement

which underpins the minority government, we move to defer Item No. 8 until this

review is completed.”

After a short discussion, it was agreed to defer this matter until the review referred

to was completed.

9.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

I will move at the next Meeting that the Council urgently draft a scheme to encourage and

promote the small and medium-sized businesses (to include a review of the rates

valuations structures) in the towns and villages of County Limerick.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donoghue stated that a review of the rates

valuations structures in towns and villages was needed. He added that income and footfall

should be taken into account for rates and not square footage.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ryan.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council endeavours at all times to encourage and

assist small and medium sized business.

To achieve this, the Council has introduced a Small and Medium Business

Support Scheme which will pay a financial support to occupiers of

commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €20,000 but not less than €500 in 2016, subject to a number of

terms and conditions.

Limerick City and County Council has also extended the Business and Retail

Incentive Scheme to all towns and villages across Limerick. This is an

extension of the current scheme which was available in Limerick City,

Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock, Newcastle West and Rathkeale. The scheme is

intended to address property vacancy rates, improve streetscapes and to

support the business community.

The Valuation Office, the independent state agency, is responsible for valuing

commercial properties. Limerick went through a rates revaluation process

during 2014 with the new valuations taking effect from 1st January, 2015.

These valuations will form the basis for commercial rates in Limerick for
---
18

current and subsequent years. As the revaluation has only recently been

carried out, a further review of rates valuation structures will not take place

in the immediate future.

Suspension of Standing Orders:  It was noted that the time was approaching 5.30pm and on

the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Collins (M), it was agreed

that Standing Orders would be suspended in order to complete the Agenda.

contract for Verdant Place will be presented to the Council for approval.

Construction is expected to commence for Verdant Place in August 2016.

The cost of the overall Kings Island Flood Relief Scheme is unknown at

present as it is dependent on the results of the site investigation works and

be significant. Expenditure to date on the scheme is €195,000.

Foynes Flood Alleviation Scheme: The Office of Public Works has approved

funding of €2,200,910 for the Foynes Flood Alleviation Scheme. Construction

11.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin

I will ask at the next Meeting for details on current contractual arrangement for the

collection and / or disposal of stray horses, the costs per call-out, and when the contract is

due for re-tendering.

REPLY:

Following tender process, Limerick City and County Council has engaged Four

Seasons, t/a ACS, 40 Leitrim Street, Cork, for horse seizure, pound facilities

and disposal of stray horses. The current contractual arrangements are in

place for a 12 month period and commenced on 8th September, 2015. There

is an option for the Council to extend the contract for 1 or 2 x 12 month

periods.

The costs per call-out are effectively the prices submitted by the successful

tenderer last year. Disclosure of this information could disadvantage both

Limerick City and County Council and the service provider in any future

tenders. In addition, the successful tenderer specifically requested this

information not to be disclosed. This information is commercially sensitive

and, in the circumstances, will not be disclosed.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

I will ask at the next Meeting when Limerick City and County Council is going to make the

waste bye-laws for City and County for the purpose of regulating and controlling the early

morning collection of waste.
---
20

REPLY:

On 2nd January, 2016, notice was published in the Iris Oifigiúil that the Waste

Management (Collection Permit) (Amendment) Regulations, 2016, would

take effect from 1st July, 2016.

Regulation 20(2)(g) of the Regulations made provision, inter alia, for the

collection of waste by attaching conditions to waste collection permits.

These conditions include the time at which waste collections are permitted.

However, on 18th May, 2016, it was decided to amend this Statutory

Instrument and we await any amendments to the Waste Management

(Collection Permit) (Amendment) Regulations, 2016.

The situation in relation to the permitted times for the collection of

household waste will be clarified as soon as amended Regulations are issued.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

I will ask at the next Meeting how many social houses are expected to be completed

construction by Limerick City and County Council in 2016.

REPLY:

The number of social housing units scheduled to be completed in Limerick in

2016 is 24 units (Cliona Park Phase 2 – Moyross, Cliona Park Gap Site –

Moyross, and Cois na Faile, Abbeyfeale (Clúid Housing).

83 houses and apartments commenced construction in 2016 to date for

handover in 2017. In addition, enabling works for 50 houses and apartments

are completed with the main contract on these units to commence shortly.

The above figures exclude housing units delivered under the major

refurbishment programme. In 2015, 107 units were funded under the major

refurbishment programme and work is ongoing as part of the 2016 work

programme to bring vacant units back into residential use.

In addition, the number of new build social housing units to be delivered via

Part V is recognised as a social housing supply mechanism. However,

estimation of the overall number is dependent on the level of activity in the

private construction sector.

14.

The Amendment was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

to keep our current District Policing Models and Six Regions as they currently exist; and

District Policing Model and to also retain the Regions structure.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Gleeson and agreed.

29. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

I will move at the next Meeting that Standing Order No. 3 (Meetings of the Council) be

amended to read as follows: Unless upon any occasion when it is otherwise fixed by

Statute or by Resolution of the Council, Ordinary Meetings of the Council shall be held

monthly on the fourth Monday of the months of September, October, November,

December, January, February, March, April, May, June and July.

Councillor Keary, in proposing the Motion, stated that he had been in contact with

other Local Authorities who had reverted to monthly meetings and that it was working very

well. He stated that the holding of bi-monthly meetings was a burden on the statutory

process and that if an item was not approved, then it was necessary to wait for a further 2

months. He asked for Standing Order No. 3 to be amended so that Full Meetings of the

Council would be held monthly with the exception of August where no Meeting would take

place.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan who said that the holding of

Monthly Meetings would avoid the necessity for Special Meetings.

The Meetings Administrator referred to the Local Government Reform Act and the

possibility of devolving additional functions to be performed at District level and that this

would be investigated.

The Deputy Chief Executive said it was timely to review Standing Orders in their

entirety and, in particular, the layout of Agendas, how Motions were working and the role of

the Corporate Policy Group.

Members also referred to the system of referring Motions to the various Strategic

Policy Committees and said that an amendment had previously been made to the Standing

Orders for Strategic Policy Committees so that Meetings would be held two weeks in
---
27

advance of bi-monthly Council Meetings so as to accommodate Motions that had been

moved at Full Council level. It was noted that this was not happening and the system would

need to be reviewed.

After a lengthy discussion on the matter, it was agreed that the Party Leaders would

review Standing Orders and that a report would be presented at the July Meeting. Based on

this, Councillor Keary agreed to defer his Motion to the July Meeting.

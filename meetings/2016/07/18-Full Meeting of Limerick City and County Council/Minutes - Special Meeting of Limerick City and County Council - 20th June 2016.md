Harrington.

following an assault.

Members noted that Win had been elected to the City Council in 1979 and had been re-

elected in 1985 serving two terms. Members said that Win was a passionate campaigner

and advocate on many issues but, in particular, on health matters and the needs of the

elderly. It was said that Win campaigned tirelessly to improve the conditions at St. Camillus’

Hospital and that she was also a strong advocate on behalf of the business community and

rate payers. Despite losing her seat in 1985, it was said that Win continued to campaign on

many issues including the need for more gender balance in politics.

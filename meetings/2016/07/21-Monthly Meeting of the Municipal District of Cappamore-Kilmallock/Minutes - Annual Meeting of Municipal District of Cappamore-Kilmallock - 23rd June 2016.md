The outgoing Cathaoirleach, Councillor O’Donnell welcomed everyone to the Annual Meeting and

gave the following address:

*“I am honoured to have served as Chairperson of the Municipal District of Cappamore**-Kilmallock*

*for the past 12 months. We are still very much on a learning curve however I am happy that our*

*District is now bedding in well and I know that we are the envy of other areas.*

*The key to the success of our Municipal District is that we have embraced change and we have*

*accepted the bona fides of Change Management and although we may be sceptical at times, we*

*have given Change Management a fair chance in everything that they have brought to us and in*

*every new project and proposal that has been put before our Committee.*

*This I believe has been a good year for our District and much progress has been made in dealing*

*with the various issues that have presented themselves to us and indeed continue to present*

*themselves on an ongoing basis. In addition to procedural changes that I have mentioned we have*

*also made best use of the new powers that have been vested in the Districts and, in particular, we*

*have dealt with budgetary matters in a collective and consensual manner. The general municipal*

*allocation gives new scope to Area Councillors to promote projects and works and I believe that all*

*parts of our Municipal District have received their fair share of the allocation. Our work in*

*allocating the GMA has been made all the easier by the detailed proposals that have been put to us*

*by our Engineers and Officials and we have taken their advice on what projects they believe should*

*be given priority. To use a sporting cliché, the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District is now a*

*great team effort.*

*I would like to thank all the Community Groups and Organisations that have come to us during the*

*year to make presentations and to engage with us on issues in their own area. This ongoing*

*communication with Community Groups and Organisations is essential and it is essential that we*

*should accommodate whenever required.*

*I would like to pay tribute to the various individuals and groups that have received civic receptions*

*during the year. The civic reception is an honour not only for the recipient but is also an honour for*

*us and we have been honoured to pay tribute during the year to John the Baptist Community*

*School on winning All Ireland Ladies Senior B Football Final, Members of Hospital Handball Club,*

*Kilteely Dromkeen - Pride of Place Winners, Ballylanders Ladies Senior Football Club on winning*

*County Final and J. P. McManus. It was a particular honour for us to have J.P. McManus attend a*

*civic reception here in Kilmallock and to facilitate the naming of this meeting room in his honour. It*

*was a great day for Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District and certainly the event raised the*

*profile of the Municipal District as a unit of government. I would in particular like to thank Willie*

*Ryan and Helen O’Neill for the**ir effort in arranging the civic receptions and catering on our behalf*

*and we do indeed owe a great thanks to Willie and Helen for the fantastic events that they*

*arranged.*

*I would like to thank the various Directors of Service that have served the area during the year and*

*it is indeed unusual that we had 3 Directors during the course of 2015/16. Firstly I would like to*

*thank Kieran Lehane for his service to the area and he definitely brought us through very turbulent*

*waters during the first year of the new Municipal District. I would like to thank Josephine Cotter*

*Coughlan for her work in the area and in particular she brought with her a great knowledge of*

*community and a greater understanding of how we can best serve the people of our area. Finally I*

*would like to thank Sean for his continued service to the area. Sean has showed great interest in*

*our area and has also shown a great interest in us as Elective Representatives and he has shown a*

*great personal commitment to the work that we do in the Municipal District.*

*I would like to thank all our officials for their hard work and dedication during the year. I would*

*like to thank the entire spectrum of staff associated with the work that is carried on in our area,*

*indoor staff and outdoor staff and indeed the officials in headquarters who continue to give us*

*support. Can I particularly thank Tina and Siobhan for their efficient running of our Municipal*

*District Meetings and apologise that we have at times run a little late. Can we also send our best*

*wishes to Liz Moloney who was with us in the early part of the term.*

*Can I finally wish the best to everyone for the coming year and in particular the incoming Mayor*

*and Deputy Mayor”.*

The Members thanked Councillor O’Donnell for all his hard work and commitment during his term

as Cathaoirleach and complimented him on his efficient and fair running of the Meetings.

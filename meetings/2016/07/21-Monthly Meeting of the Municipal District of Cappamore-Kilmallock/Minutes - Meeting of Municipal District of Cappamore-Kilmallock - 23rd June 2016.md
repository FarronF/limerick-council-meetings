**QUESTIONS**

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor B. Teefy**

***I will ask at the next meeting when will the remaining work to the extension of Caherconlish***

***Graveyard be carried out and totally completed.***

**REPLY**:

The Council developed a programme of works to facilitate the extension of

Caherconlish cemetery and has commenced work on site. The Council also

provided a budget to undertake these works.

However, as the development of the extension progressed, it became apparent

that additional works, over and above those initially identified, were necessary

to ensure that the extension was developed to the highest possible standard.

The additional necessary works have now been identified and it is the intention

of the Council to seek a costing for the additional works.

The Council is not in a position to definitively confirm at this point when the

works will be totally completed until such time as the costing is received,

funding secured and a timeframe for the carrying out of the works agreed.

The Council will keep the Members informed of the likely completion date as

soon as it is in a position to do so.

The following items were raised at the completion of the Agenda:

Councillor Teefy expressed concern that a large number of General Operatives were retiring in

the coming months and the Acting Head of Finance stated that each case would be looked at.

The Executive Engineer confirmed that there was no room for additional parking spaces at

Bruff National School but that he would be sending a request for a school warden to the Road

Safety Officer.

With the Cathaoirleach’s permission, sympathy was extended to Brian Kennedy, Operations

Manager, West and South Division, on the death of his father, John Kennedy.

Members requested that priority be given to hedge cutting as it was a safety issue.

This concluded the Meeting.

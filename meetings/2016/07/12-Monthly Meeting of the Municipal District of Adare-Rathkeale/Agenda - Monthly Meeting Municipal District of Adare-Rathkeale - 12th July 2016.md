QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

| will ask at the next Meeting approximately how much it costs to maintain the park in Adare on
an annual basis and how much funding is available for the park for the remainder of this year.

| will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to bring forward the date for the cutting of
hedgerow’s on public roads in the district.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

I will move at the next Meeting that adequate funding be provided by Limerick City and County
Council in order that basic road maintenance standards can be achieved in the interest of public
health and safety. As the Department is the sole beneficiary from Motor Tax we must give safe
passage to and from our schools, workplaces and for agricultural contractors to carry out their
works safely. | will move also that a schedule be agreed, without delay, for roadside hedgerow
cutting, Phase 1 of which must be school bus routes so that we are ready for September.

Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

| will move at the next Meeting that the Department of Transport carry out an immediate
investigation into the Part 8 Planning Application for Road Overlay Works in Adare Village which
are about to commence without due consideration being given for the inclusion of a foul sewer
to serve adjacent lands and which will, if omitted on this occasion, necessitate the re- excavation
of this stretch of road at a conservative cost of €1,000,000.00 to the hard pressed tax payer and
cause months of repeated traffic flow disruption

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately exercise their
powers and prevent illegal trading taking place from unauthorised premises that have been
brought to their attention in recent months.

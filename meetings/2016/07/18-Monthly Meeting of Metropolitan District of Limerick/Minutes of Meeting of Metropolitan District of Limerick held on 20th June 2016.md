A number of Members raised concerns regarding the level of funding which had been provided
to bring this course up to a high standard and stressed the need for urgent action to be taken to
ensure that the course was managed effectively.

The Senior Manager, Social Development, in reply, pointed out that there had been difficulties
in relation to the maintenance agreement for Rathbane Golf Club. The current operator had
been engaged on a month by month basis, on the terms of the original contract, to operate and
manage the facility. A procurement procedure was currently being undertaken to identify an
operator for the course for a five year period, with an option to extend for an additional five
years. The procurement process was at an advanced stage and it was hoped would be finalised
shortly. In the interim a number of meetings had been held with the club members and efforts
were being made to bring the course up to a satisfactory standard to allow competition
schedules for the coming weeks / months to go ahead. The situation was being kept under
review and every effort was being made to finalise the procurement process and install a new
operator at an early stage.

14. Noti Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

! will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District introduce appropriate By-
Laws to standardise the design of signage placed by retail and business owners in Limerick
City so as to prevent the placement of unsuitable signage at the front of various businesses
and shopfronts.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin who referred to problems associated with poor
signage around the city area.

The motion was seconded by Councillor Hourigan who also referred to problems with
businesses which had closed down and where the signage was still in place and he requested
that action be taken to remove such signage.

REPLY: The Limerick City Development Plan sets out standards in relation to signage and
advertising on buildings. In general advertising on buildings should conform with
the following:

Be sympathetic in design and colour both to the building on which the
signage will be displayed and the surrounding buildings etc.
Not obscure architectural features such as cornices or window openings.
Illuminated signs or other advertising structures will not be allowed above
the eaves or parapet level on buildings in any part of the City.
Shop front advertising should be designed as an integral part of the shop
front and not left as an afterthought.
Applications for new, or a change of use of commercial units, will be
required to indicate what type of signage is proposed.

In response to further queries, the Senior Executive Officer, Corporate Services stated that the
matter would be referred to the Enforcement Section for follow-up. It was also agreed that the

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin

! will move at the next Meeting that the Council consider the placement of additional
temporary bins along the river quays, boardwalks and Arthurs Quay to facilitate locals and
tourists who wish to discard their rubbish.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Crowley.

Reference was also made to the need for additional bins in public parks and also for bins in the
Wetlands area in Westfield Park. A number of Members referred to the problems with littering
and issues with weeds etc and reference was made to the need for replacement of the lamps on
the Abbey Bridge as four lamps were currently not working. There was a problem also with the’
general condition of the area adjacent to where the coca-cola bikes were kept, which required

tidying up.

Congratulations were expressed to the Parks Department for their great work around the city
and in particular reference was made to the flower arrangements which improved the vision of
the city streets significantly.

REPLY: There are currently 10 bins between Shannon Bridge and Sarsfield Bridge on the
Harveys Quay side of the river. There are 7 bins on O'Callaghan Strand and 5 bins
on Clancy Strand. These numbers should be adequate to facilitate users in these

areas.

Temporary bins would be very difficult to manage in terms of movability and
probability of being used for illegal dumping. We will keep these areas under
review.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor James Collins

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council request Eir to provide high speed broadband
at Mungret without further delay.

In proposing the motion Councillor Collins expressed disappointment that the national provider
Eir had not included Mungret in their plans for provision of high speed broadband in the short
term. He referred to the development of Mungret College and the park area and the residential
development which would take place in this general area and requested that Eir be called on to
provide high speed broadband for this area and Mungret Village at an early stage. The motion
was seconded by Councillor McCreesh and agreed.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor James Collins

! will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on the Government to tackle the
spiralling costs of insurance.

the increases proposed in the new book of quantum regarding insurance compensation.

persons attending the hospital and visitors. He pointed out that there was an urgent need to
provide a bus shelter at this location. The motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

and requested that this matter be examined further.

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Michael Hourigan and Frankie Daly

We will call at the next Meeting for the Council to have the resurfacing of North Circular Road
and Mill Road, Corbally and the repair of footpaths that have been damaged by the
installation of water pipes carried out as a matter of urgency.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Daly, who referred to the damage to roads and
footpaths at the North Circular Road and Mill Road, Corbally, caused during the installation of

water pipes.

A number of Members pointed out that similar issues were occurring in many locations
throughout the city where works were being undertaken by contractors, acting on behalf of Irish
Water, and there was a need for greater levels of co-ordination between the public utility
companies and the Council in relation to the planning and carrying out of such works.

REPLY: The installation of water pipes on North Circular Road, Limerick and Mill Road,
Corbally is been carried out by Contractors working on behalf of Irish Water. The
Regional Services Directorate (Water Services Department) of Limerick City and
County Council has a role in managing these contracts on behalf of Irish Water.
The Service Operations Department of Limerick City and County Council has
issued a Road Opening Licence to Irish Water for these works and the conditions
of this Licence include that good quality reinstatements of the roads and
footpaths are carried out after completing pipe laying works in accordance with
the terms of the Road Opening Licence and in accordance with the Purple Book,
(Guidelines for Managing Openings in Public Roads-Guidelines for the Opening,
Backfilling and Reinstatement of Openings in Public Roads).

resource to be maintained and secured while a long term plan is brought forward.

21. Noti f Motion submitted mhlr. Séighin allaigh

| will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on the Minister for Education to relocate
the planned secondary school for Castletroy to Castleconnell.

The motion was proposed by Cmhir. 6 Ceallaigh who referred to the current secondary school
at Castletroy and the level of overcrowding and significant traffic disruption in the area. He
pointed out there was a significant population in the Castleconnell area and that the provision
of a new school in that area would be of greater benefit than providing a second school in the
Castletroy area. The motion was seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

A number of Members however were not in agreement with the motion, referring to the
general growth of population in the Castletroy area which meant that a second school was
required in that area. Reference was made to the potential for such a school at the Parkway
Valley area which would then cater for the Singland and Garryowen areas and would curtail the

numbers from that area travelling to Castletroy College thereby eliminating some of the
overcrowding and traffic problems at that location. It was agreed that further consideration

question was not considered suitable for additional social housing.

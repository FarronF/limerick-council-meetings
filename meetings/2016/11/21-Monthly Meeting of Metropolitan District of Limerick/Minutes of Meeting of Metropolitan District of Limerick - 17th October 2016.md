**QUESTIONS**

**3.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what plans or activities are scheduled to cover the Christmas***

***and New Year’s Eve*** ***period in the city so as to encourage shoppers and visitors into the city***

***centre during the festive season.***

**REPLY:**

Christmas in Limerick 2016 will look to promote the culture, taste and spirit of the

festive season.

The Council is working in partnership with local businesses, street traders, and

cultural operators to collaborate on Christmas themed events and actions whilst

adding signature events to promote the city centre as a destination.

The Christmas programme will launch with a Turning on of the Lights event on

20th November 2016 at 6pm in the city centre.

The launch of the Christmas festival is a highly anticipated event each year and

we want to wait until after Halloween, during the first week in November 2016 to

announce the full details to the public.

The main features will include pop up events targeted at families at key locations.

The programme will produce a creative, inclusive and most importantly family

centred programme of activities in the retail centre of the city and enhance the

significant ongoing and existing programme of events which takes place over the

festive season.

Christmas in Limerick will be supported by a public relations and communications

campaign with a Munster focus co-ordinated by the Office of Communications

and Marketing.

**Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if there are any discussions ongoing with Dunnes Stores who***

***own a number of strategic buildings in the city centre that remain empty and if so what plans***

***have Dunnes Stores to reuse these same buildings.***

**REPLY:**

It has been over eighteen months since Limerick City & County Council has

directly engaged with Dunnes Stores regarding their two unoccupied city centre

properties. At that time the Council was trying to determine what plans Dunnes

Stores had for the said properties. One of the properties has since been put on

the rental/lease market but currently remains unoccupied. No indication
---

regarding the plans for the second building at Sarsfield Bridge have been

conveyed to the Council.

The Council promotes business /retail occupation in the city centre through

various measure such as the Business & Retail Incentive Scheme. It has assisted in

identifying suitable accommodation for business location in the city centre by

engaging directly with property owners and businesses seeking to have a city

centre presence. We have had little engagement with Dunnes Stores in

connection with their properties.

**5.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what the current status of Rathbane Golf Club is, and what plans***

***are there for the future of the Club.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council is currently completing a negotiated

procurement procedure for the provision of a new management, maintenance

and operation contract for Rathbane Golf Course and the process is due to be

completed within the next few weeks. The bids submitted were assessed by an

independent evaluation committee as required under the negotiated

procurement procedure as the initial open procurement procedure was not

successful. The Evaluation Committee have completed the evaluation of the bids

and it is anticipated that they will submit their final report, including

recommendation next week. Once received, work will commence on drawing up

a contract with a view to having a new management, maintenance and operation

contract in place for five years with the option to extend for one additional five

year period.

The Council meets on a regular basis with representatives of Rathbane Golf Club

and is in regular contact with the current maintenance contractor to oversee the

operation and maintenance of the course and to address issues that arise.

**6.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what plans are there for the Court Facilities in Merchant's Quay,***

***following the completion of the new Courthouse site.***

**REPLY:**

The Council is currently considering its options in relation to this complex. The

Council will engage with the Courts Service in terms of its vacation date but at

this point the Council considers the building as suitable for civic purposes such as

exhibitions, public events and other ancillary activities to the Corporate

Headquarters.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many outdoor staff are employed in the Metropolitan***

***District in parks and road maintenance, and how does that compare with 10 years ago?***

**REPLY:**

There are currently 143 outdoor staff employed in the Metropolitan District in

road maintenance and 20 outdoor staff employed in parks maintenance in the
---
4

Metropolitan area in Limerick City and County Council. Unfortunately it is not

possible to provide figures for comparison purposes for 10 years ago as staffing

figures were not historically compiled in the manner in which the request has

been made and the information requested is no longer available

Please note also the Metropolitan area as it currently exists within Limerick City

and County Council was not in place at that time. The provision of accurate

figures is therefore problematic given the then existence of two separate local

authorities with different work areas/practices.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if there has been any progress in getting the EPA to re-open a***

***permanent air quality monitoring station in Limerick City?***

**REPLY:**

The EPA has just published a consultation paper on the “National Ambient Air

Quality Monitoring Programme 2017 -2022”. In this paper it gives details of the

current air monitoring network and outlines proposals to significantly increase

the number of monitoring stations around the country.

In relation to Limerick, the proposal is to retain the existing Shannon Estuary

station and to add a permanent station in Limerick City. An indicative monitoring

station, which will monitor particulates, is also proposed for Abbeyfeale. It is

envisaged that the new stations will be installed in the first three years of the

programme which runs from 2017 to 2022.

The consultation paper is available on the EPA website at:

http://www.epa.ie/pubs/consultation/files/airqualconsultationoct2016.html

Feedback on the proposal can be given through:

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next meeting that the Council provide a map highlighting all currently unused***

***council-owned lands in the Metropolitan District and an accompanying legend outlining the***

***size of each site?***

**REPLY:**

A map as requested is currently being prepared which will highlight areas of

unused land in excess of 1 acre within the Metropolitan District. This map will be

circulated shortly.

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Sean Lynch**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the taking in charge of Steamboat Quay.***

**REPLY:**

In accordance with the formal taking in charge process the Council has advertised

its intention to declare the road at Steamboat Quay to be a public road. The

public have until the 14th October, 2016 to make a submission on the proposed
---

taking in charge. Once the public display period has expired a report will be

prepared and brought to the next District Meeting for approval.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for details of the Council's plans for the clearing of drains and***

***gullies prior to the winter rainfall as the removal of leaves and rubbish, blocking water flow,***

***will prevent flooding and lead to cost saving.***

**REPLY:**

It is the practice every year to take on one or two outside contractors to clean

out all gullies in the Metropolitan area over a four to six month period starting in

November. Last year the contract was given to two contractors who started work

in November. Tender documents are currently being prepared with a view

to going to tender in order to have two contractors in place before the end of

November. A budget is set aside for this work.

**12.**

**Question submitted by Councillor John Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, in relation to the 6,765 houses offered by NAMA to local***

***authorities and housing organisations since 2012, how many of those offered to the Council***

***were located in the Metropolitan District and how many of these offers have been accepted?***

**REPLY**:

I wish to advise that in total nineteen properties have been offered to Limerick

City and County Council by NAMA in co-ordination with The Housing Agency.

Sixteen of these units were confirmed for housing need, to date four of the

properties have been purchased. *Information valid up to the end of June, 2016,*

*information July-Oct to be collated.*

Members noted that a number of motions submitted were to be referred to Strategic Policy

Committees. The Mayor confirmed that if Members were not a Member of a Strategic Policy

Committee they were entitled to attend the Meeting if they had a Notice of Motion on the

agenda.

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District invite the CEO of Shannon***

***Airport Authority into a District Meeting to discuss how best we can work in a collaborative***

***manner to promote tourism and visitor numbers to Limerick.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Secas.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin emphasised the importance of working with Shannon

Airport Authority in a collaborative way. He welcomed the announcement of new routes from

the airport and stressed the need to develop a tourism strategy for the region.

**REPLY**:

I wish to advise that the under listed resolution was unanimously passed by the

Members of the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee at its

meeting held on 10th October, 2016:

“That Limerick City and County Council request Shannon Airport Authority to

provide a briefing to the full Limerick City and County Council in relation to the

current economic and transport links between Shannon Airport and the Limerick

region and to consider how these economic and transport links could/should be

developed and strengthened into the future”.

It was agreed by the Members of the Travel & Transportation SPC that the

proposed briefing should be presented to the full Council, having regard to the

strategic importance of Shannon Airport to the entire Limerick region.

The proposed briefing to full Council will allow Members to discuss with the

Shannon Airport Authority how best the parties might collaborate to fully develop

the potential of the Limerick area as a centre of growth.

**15.**

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District calls for the restoration of***

***the weed control budget, to address rising problems with weeds in the city.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller stated that the restoration of the weed control budget

was urgently required as areas in the city, particularly the Garryowen area, were overgrown

with weeds.

**REPLY**:

The Council recognises the positive benefit that a comprehensive weed killing

programme would have in both economic and social terms in enhancing the city

as a desirable location to invest, work and live in.

The Council endeavours to undertake a programme of weed spraying, subject to

the limited budget available for such work.

I estimate that an additional allocation of €50,000 over and above the 2016

general allocation will be required to develop and implement a comprehensive

weed control programme in the city in 2017.

I have sought such funding in the proposed 2017 budget and trust that the

Members of Council are in a position to provide this additional funding to allow

the Council undertake a targeted, weed control programme.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville (to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***and how the Council can help.***

***units.***

Committee.

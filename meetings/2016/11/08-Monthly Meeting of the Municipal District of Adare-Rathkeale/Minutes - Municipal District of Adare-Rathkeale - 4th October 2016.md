4. Service Operations — Planning & Environmental Services
(a) | Update on the Taking in Charge of Ballyvareen Estate

The Meetings Administrator informed the Meeting that the position in relation to the taking in
charge of Ballyvareen Estate was unchanged with the operation of the waste water treatment
plant being kept under review over a period to establish how best to spend the limited budget
associated with the taking in charge in this case.

(b) | Update on the Taking in Charge of An Curran Estate, Pallaskenry

Circulated, Report from Staff Officer, Planning and Environmental Services dated 28" September,
2016 which noted that a letter had been issued to the developer of An Curran on 27" May, 2016
outlining the outstanding issues that needed to be resolved before the estate could be taken in
charge and requesting that the developer contact the Council when the works were completed.
The report noted that no response had been received for the developer to date.

wastewater treatment plant damaging the access road to the plant and requested a report in

5. Sewerage Treatment Plant in Askeaton

Circulated correspondence dated 14" September 2016 from Irish Water noting that proposals to
upgrade the Waste Water Treatment Plan in Askeaton had not been included in Irish Water's
2017-2021 Investment Plan submission to the Commission of Energy Regulation.

Members expressed their disappointment and dissatisfactions at this decision and noted that the
existing wastewater treatment facilities at Askeaton were comprised of settlement beds only and
that, as a result, raw sewage was being discharged from the plant to the river Deel and adjacent
Shannon Estuary. Members stressed the health risk this posed to swimmers and boat users in
these waters and also noted the presence of a high profile food manufacturing operation in the
locality and called on the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) to take the appropriate steps to
ensure that the plant was brought up to an acceptable standard. Members highlighted that the
lack of suitable waste water infrastructure in Askeaton was restricting its potential economic
development and called on the Executive of the Council to highlight the need for an upgrade of
Askeaton Waste Water Treatment Plant to Irish Water.

Councillor Sheahan invited the District Members to visit the existing outfall in Askeaton and on the
proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Teskey it was agreed that the District

should write to the three TD's in the Constituency seeking their assistance in securing an upgrade
for Askeaton Waste Water Treatment Plant.

6. Flooding Issues

The Meetings Administrator informed the Meeting that, in relation to Foynes Flood Prevention
Works the tender had been awarded and the contractor was on site; in relation to Askeaton Flood
Prevention Works the preliminary design was in place and a reply was awaited from the Office of
Public Works (OPW) in relation to funding for the proposed works.

It was noted that there was uncertainly as to who was responsible for the maintenance of the
flood defence at Ballysteen and the Meetings Administrator undertook to contact the OPW to
seek clarification in this regard.

QUESTIONS

7. Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will ask at the next Meeting why Ballysteen was not included with Foynes and Askeaton for
planned flood relief works.

REPLY: A minor works application for Ballysteen was submitted to the Office of Public
Works in March 2014. The application was for €20,000 to provide flood alleviation
measures for Ballysteen. The application was not approved for funding as it did not
meet the benefit-cost criteria for the minor works scheme.

8. Question submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

1 will ask at the next Meeting what is the position regarding the bottle bank for the town of
Ballingarry.

REPLY: A footpath was constructed at the site of the original bottle bank location at
Doonbeirne Estate approximately two years ago. Since that time, we have tried to
place the bottle banks at a number of locations including the church car park, an
area adjacent to the church car park and an area within Doonbeirne Estate.
Previously we looked at locating them adjacent to O’Grady’s service station,
Ballingarry Park, Ballingarry Community Hall and on the premises of the public
house on the Adare Road. All of these locations met with strong resistance from
either the property owners, members of the public, community groups or all of the
above.

We sincerely wish to place bottle banks in Ballingarry and are seeking a location
that is agreeable to the community.

9. Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will ask at the next Meeting for a detailed report on the Council’s intentions regarding
Kilbradran Burial Ground.

REPLY:

The burial ground maintenance committee in Kilbradran Cemetery, unaware the
cemetery was closed, allocated plots to families on what were both existing marked
and unmarked burial plots. They also allowed these families to erect headstones
and surrounds on these plots without seeking the advice or permission of Limerick
City & County Council. This practice has been going on since our last caretaker
resigned in 1998. The burial ground maintenance committee’s sole function is
maintenance of the cemetery and does not include allocation of grave spaces.

We have requested the committee to contact those families concerned advising
them that where allocated plots are unoccupied, the families are requested to
remove headstones, surrounds and markers.

There is no available space for new burials in this cemetery.

Councillor Sheahan indicated that he was anxious to establish who owned the cemetery at
Kilbradran and was dissatisfied that District Members had not been kept informed of
developments at this location.

Councillor Sheahan proposed that the appropriate staff member should attend at the next District
Meeting and give a detailed explanation of the Council’s intentions with regard to Kilbradran
Cemetery. Members agreed to this proposal.

10. Question submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the planning application for the new
secondary school in Croom and an update on the new link road around Croom.

REPLY:

On 25 January 2016, a planning application was submitted by the Board of
Management of Colaiste Chiarain (PA 16/50) for: the construction of (i) a two
storey, post primary school, to be used for educational purposes, (ii) 3 no. playing
pitches, (iii) internal vehicular & pedestrian infrastructure including roads,
footpaths, car parking spaces and bus & car set-down areas, (iv) a vehicular and
pedestrian access off the New Distributor Road identified in the Croom Local Area
Plan which is to be constructed by the local authority, (v) the provision of a
temporary construction access from the L-1478-1, (vi) an on-site foul pumping
station, (vii) an underground tank to facilitate rainwater harvesting and a Class 1
interceptor and (viii) all ancillary site development works, Skagh, Croom’

Further Information request was issued by the Planning Authority on 18 March
2016.

No response to the Further Information request has been received by the Planning
Authority to date.

The Council is currently concluding the scheme development and preliminary
design for the Croom Distributor road. The Council expects to commence the
consultative element of this work shortly leading to the formal publication of the
drawings and documentation under the Part 8 Public Consultation process in the
coming weeks.

11. Question submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

REPLY: A request for funding for a pedestrian crossing at Loghill Church has been
forwarded to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (Til).

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale consider receiving
a Deputation from Ballyhahill Community Council.

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Teskey. It was
agreed that a deputation from Ballyhahill Community Council would be invited to attend and give
a presentation at the December Meeting of the District.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

| will move at the next Meeting that the Department of Transport and Transport Infrastructure
Ireland immediately act on the junction of the N21 near Reens Pike, turning onto the R523 from
Newcastle West to Rathkeale. | am requesting that effective signage and road markings be put
in place to recognise a turning point on this National road, to avoid potential calamities. In
addition | also request that the above would erect lighting at the Reens Pike junction turning on
to Ardagh.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey noted a number of recent accidents at this location and
stressed the need for increased safety measures to be put in place there.

Members supported the Motion and noted the absence of ‘\\\:\\:\’ signs approaching the junction
and previous request from both Members and Deputations to have safety measures provided at
this location.

REPLY: Operations & Maintenance Services will forward this motion to the Regional Road
Safety Engineer for consideration. It should be noted that similar requests for
public lighting at junctions similar to the one that is the subject of this motion have
been unsuccessful. TIl's view is that this junction would be no different than any
other priority rural junction on the National Road Network.

Members noted that the Mid-West National Road Design Office had undertaken to review the
high number of junctions on this stretch of road and that the selection of the route for the
proposed new Limerick Foynes Route may impact on same. Members expressed disappointment
that the Design Office had not been requested to respond to the Motion and requested that the
Design Team outline their proposals for this stretch of road for the next District Meeting.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O’Donoghue

| will move at the next Meeting that the Council's Roads Engineers put a plan in place to repair
the footpaths in St. Mary's Park, Rathkeale in the interest of public health and safety.

7
Members acknowledge the work already carried out to the footpaths in St. Mary’s Park, Rathkeale
but expressed disappointment that a local TD had received a written commitment from Customer
Services that works would be carried out there while Councillor, who had made similar
representation, had received no such commitment.
REPLY: The Council has highlighted 2no. sections of footpath for replacement in St Marys
Park. These works are currently proceeding.

We do not have the budget to complete all poor sections in St Marys Park due to
our limited budget available.

16. Correspondence

Correspondence was noted.
The following issues were raised at the conclusion of the agenda :-

At Askeaton Pool and Leisure there was an existing sign advertising the availability of camper van
parking which was misleading and should be relocated.

The walkway on the Askeaton Bypass was covered in grass and the path was almost gone.
An update on the provision of footpath from Adare to the GAA ground was requested.

At this point the Cathaoirleach indicated that the remainder of the Meeting would be held “in
committee” to discuss the taking-in-charge of Cois Sruthain, Croom

This concluded the Meeting.

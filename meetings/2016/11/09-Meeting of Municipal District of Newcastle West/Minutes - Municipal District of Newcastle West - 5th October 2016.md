12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

/ will move at the next Meeting that adequate funding be procured from the Development
Levy Monies to secure the sewer and water services infrastructure along the inner section of
the Desmond Business Park, Newcastle West.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Scanlan stated that this matter needed to be addressed if
further business was to be secured for Newcastle West. It was suggested that a meeting could
be arranged with Economic Development and the existing traders in the Desmond Business Park
to try and find a solution. It was noted that as this was a private estate, the Council could not
take it in charge.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY: Limerick City and County Council understand that this business park is not
publicly owned or managed. In that context the spending of public monies
collected through the development levies on a private development is not
appropriate.

In addition, the provision of water and sewage infrastructure no longer rests with
local authorities but is the responsibility of Irish Water. Development levies for
water and sewage infrastructure collected prior to 2014 were transferred to Irish
Water at the time of the company’s establishment. Since 2014 the Council does
not levy planning contributions for water and sewage infrastructure.

As part of its broader remit of stimulating economic development in Limerick,
staff were prepared to meet with the promoters of this development to discuss
ways in which the Council might help to address their issues.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

! will move at the next Meeting that an audit of parking/loading bay designations be
undertaken for The Square and North Quay, Newcastle West.

Councillor Scanlan, in proposing the Motion, stated that it was imperative that an audit be
carried out and that business people be consulted.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

The Executive Engineer, Roads, confirmed that an audit of parking/loading bays would be
carried out as requested.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

! will move at the next Meeting that funding be provided at budget time to put in place a
footpath from St. Michael’s House, Ballyagran towards the village.

Councillor Galvin, in proposing the Motion, stated that it was imperative that this footpath be
put in place as the residents at St. Michael's House did not have safe access to the village.
Members requested that costings and a detailed design be carried out for the installation of a
footpath. The Director stated that the District had €100,000 last year for discretionary funding
and added that works such as this could be funded from that source if agreed.

REPLY: As previously advised the estimated cost of the footpath is approximately
€70,000 euro. The only potential sources of funding for this type of project are
the Development Fund or the General Municipal Allocation.

Consideration should be given in the 2017 Newcastle West Schedule of Municipal
District Works to allocate funding from either the Development Fund or the
General Municipal Allocation or a combination of both.

Due to the considerable cost it may be prudent to consider funding this project
over a number of years.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

1 will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the Minister for Transport, Tourism
and Sport to support the pupils of Castlemahon National School who live on the R1307
Balliniska line that are not collected by the local school bus, in their efforts to secure safe
transport to and from Castlemahon National School.

On the proposal of Councillor Browne, seconded by Councillor Scanlan, it was agreed to refer
the Motion to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

It was agreed that the November Meeting of the District would be held on Wednesday, 3"
November, 2016.

This concluded the Meeting.

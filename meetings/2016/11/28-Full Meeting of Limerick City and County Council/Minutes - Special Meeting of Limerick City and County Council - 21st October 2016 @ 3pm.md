FOYNES/LIMERICK ROAD

The Meetings Administrator stated that apologies had been received from the

Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland. He

proceeded to read the apologies received into the record of the Meeting:

Reply from Mr. Paul Moran, Chartered Engineer, Regional Manager, South-

West Region, Transport Infrastructure Ireland

“I refer to the invitation to attend a Special Council Meeting being held this Friday.

Transport Infrastructure Ireland are not in a position to attend Council Meetings and,

as an alternative, we accept a delegation from the Local Authorities once a year,

where issues of concern can be discussed.

Limerick City and County Council has already requested same (ref. e-mail from Mr.

Ger Dillon, Senior Executive Officer, on 14th October to Transport Infrastructure

Ireland) where a number of issues have been identified for discussion. The

delegation will be limited to 8 persons, i.e. a representative from each Municipal

District and 4 Council officials.

Therefore, I can confirm that I will not be in attendance this Friday, but Transport

Infrastructure Ireland will revert to Mr. Dillon to confirm a date for the delegation in

our offices in Dublin.”

Reply from Mr. Dominic Mullaney, Principal Adviser, Roads Division,

Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport

“Thank you for your e-mail of 13th October, 2016, on behalf of Limerick City and

County Council and invitation to attend a Special Meeting of Elected Members on
---
**3**

Friday, 21st October, 2016, to discuss the Foynes to Limerick Road Improvement

Scheme.

I wish to advise the Council that the Department has no role in the design of

Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) projects. TII must go through appropriate

procedures when planning for a major new road and ultimately the matter is

determined by An Bord Pleanála. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate

for the Department to attend the proposed Special Meeting.”

Councillor Keary addressed the Meeting and began by thanking the Mayor, the

Executive and the Councillors who had facilitated the Special Meeting. He welcomed the

members of the public to the public gallery and also the Oireachtas Members and Members

of the European Parliament who, he stated, were there to observe on this occasion but who

he hoped would pick up the baton in support of the Motion before the Meeting. He then

read the following Statement:

“The Code of Conduct for Councillors requires a Councillor to declare his interests in

matters before the Council. The relevant extract from the Code of Conduct reads as

follows:-

Article 3.7: The test to be applied by a Councillor is not just what s/he might think –

but rather whether a member of the public knowing the facts of the situation would

reasonably think that the interest concerned might influence the person in the

performance of his or her functions. If so, disclosure should follow and a Councillor

should consider whether in the circumstances s/he should withdraw from

consideration of the matter. In this context, it is important to ensure that as well as

the avoidance of actual impropriety, occasions for suspicion and appearance of

improper conduct are also avoided in case of private or personal interests.

I wish to advise this meeting of Limerick City and County Council that as well as being

a Councillor for the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District, I am the owner of

Agricultural land in the townlands of Clogh West and Amogan Beg which are located

about one and a half miles west of Croagh Village. The overall proposal for the

Foynes to Limerick road that is currently available to all members of the public since

September 2016 will affect part of my lands.

Lest there be any public perception of conflict of interest and to ensure that any part

of this process cannot be called into question, I wish to reiterate that, in my opinion,

the motion today for the provision of an interchange for Croagh Village is a separate

matter and is one which I have supported since the preferred route (namely the

Orange Route) was announced last December.

It is also worth noting that the current proposed route did not include my lands

when the route corridor selection was open for submissions under the public

consultation process. As part of that consultative process, I made a submission to

have an interchange for the village of Croagh provided in the route as it was
---
**4**

proposed at the time and the rationale for this interchange is as valid in this revised

route as it was in the original route which did not include my lands.”

Councillor Keary then read the following Notice of Motion to the Meeting –

“I will move at a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that the Council call on

all associated with the Design Process of the Foynes to Limerick Road Improvement Scheme

namely, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), The Department of Transport, Tourism and

Sport, Limerick City and County Council, The Mid West National Road Design Office, Roughan

and O’Donovan-AECOM Alliance, to include an essential interchange as part of their design

on lands north-west of Croagh Village to facilitate proper connectivity to the communities of

Adare, Croagh, Rathkeale and the surrounding rural countryside of this part of West

Limerick, in the interest of continued economic rural sustainability.”

Councillor Keary then read the following into the record of the Meeting:

“I want to state that as a landowner and resident of the Parish of Croagh, I will be

impacted along with many of my neighbours by the development of this road,

however, I wish to put on the record again my support for this project in principle.

I also wish to put on public record that I as an elected representative or any public

representatives be it at local, national or European level do not have any role

whatsoever in the selection of the route and we do not have any sort of insider

information or prior warning on what routes will or will not be selected and I must

say, I welcome this in the interest of openness and transparency.

This procedure of ensuring that route selection processes are out of the hands of

elected representatives is in stark contrast to the system that previously pertained

where routes across the country were drawn up by local representatives with

personal agendas leading to bad and, often times, unsafe road designs. The existing

N21 shows how the route selection process that was in place 30 years ago when the

Croagh by-pass was planned was clearly a product of the process which prevailed at

the time.

The unfortunate historical evidence of the many fatalities and serious injuries

inflicted on motorists and road users along the stretch of road between Adare and

Newcastle West can be heavily weighted against poor planning and poor road

design.

The convening of this meeting as a result of the tabling of this motion is the properly

constituted forum for this matter to be discussed. While there will be a temptation

to raise unrelated matters or raise false hopes I want to be very clear that the

purpose of this meeting is to create accessibility from the new road proposal to the

existing N21 at Croagh village.
---
**5**

I want to stress that I am not here today to advocate for or against any particular

route and I am not here to advocate for any landowner or affected party including

myself, lest there be any confusion or attempt to confuse.

I have publicly stated on numerous occasions, the importance of this road and the

connectivity it will create. The proposed road will open up the west Limerick and

Kerry region, making it more accessible and facilitating large traffic volumes by

connecting our communities to the national motorway network. When completed

this route will give continuous motorway connectivity between the port of Foynes

and Larne in Co. Antrim, making the Shannon Estuary and West Limerick an even

more attractive location for inward investment and job creation.

Shannon Foynes Port Company is the second largest port in the country, is the

largest bulk port in the country and is the only Tier 1 port of national importance on

the west coast handling in excess of 10 million tonnes of cargo per annum. Foynes

Port is currently 100% reliant on an unacceptable and dangerous road, namely the

N69 from Foynes to Limerick.

The road will also ensure that gridlock in villages like Adare will be removed, it will

improve road safety and will improve the quality of life in the village itself and

remove the many rat runs to avoid Adare which have developed in the surrounding

areas that includes part of the parishes of Patrickswell, Adare, Cappagh, Kilfinny,

Granagh, Ballingarry, Croom, Kildimo, Rathkeale, Croagh and others as daily

commuters go to and from their place of work.

However, there is no denying that this is possibly the single biggest issue in over a

generation to face the community of Croagh. This village which is located on the

road between Rathkeale and Adare, the main Limerick to Killarney road ran through

Croagh before it was bypassed almost 30 years ago. Croagh village is home to a

church, school, music school, garden centre, nursing home, crèche, hairdresser,

medical centre, visitor accommodation, restaurant, shop and two pubs to name but

a few together with a thriving agriculture sector as well as having state of the art

GAA, camogie and community facilities. The proposed route as currently shown is

located in the heartland of the best agricultural land in Ireland let alone Co. Limerick.

The current proposal includes interchanges at both Adare and Rathkeale and

completely overlooks and ignores Croagh Village as a non-entity.

The inclusion of an interchange at this location will enhance the lives of in excess of

4000 local residents who would have access to the motorway network at this point.

The jobs of almost 200 people within the area defined as the settlement of Croagh in

the Limerick County development plan are being put in jeopardy by not making

provision for this interchange.

In excess of 50 % of these people are employed directly in tourism and related

services and are completely reliant on passing traffic from the existing N21.
---

This interchange will not only safeguard but enhance the future growth of the

village. It is also worth noting that the village of Croagh has adequate capacity and

infrastructural services for future growth and expansion.

This interchange is being requested for one reason and one reason only. Continued

Economic Sustainability for our Rural Communities.

Successive Governments have spent massive resources on reports and strategies in

identifying methods to provide continued sustainability to rural Ireland. The road

proposal in its current format flies in the face of all of these policies.

The proposed route will not just overlook Croagh but it will also completely isolate

the surrounding towns and villages of Kilfinny, Cappagh and Rathkeale. It will make

accessibility between the N21 and surrounding parishes and visitor attractions

virtually impossible to access. This includes the historic Curraghchase Park and

Campsite, Knockfierna Hill and many other places of interest.

There is currently one interchange identified at the eastern side of Adare on this

proposed route.

Up to 16,000 vehicles pass through Adare each day and this can increase to 30,000

on busy bank holiday weekends. It is worth noting that Adare was voted in the Top

Ten of Fáilte Ireland's Tourism Towns Initiative 2015.

While this level of traffic creates huge delays for people travelling this road or trying

to access Adare we do not want a situation whereby the village becomes inaccessible

because of this road. While I am here today to advocate for an interchange for

Croagh which would also service Adare and Rathkeale it is clear to me and others

that the community of Adare has as much to lose if not more than Croagh from the

existing proposed design.

One of the many fears that has been expressed to me by business interests in Adare

is that if a motorist travelling on the new motorway realises too late that they have

passed the village there will be no way of turning back and instead they will continue

along the road until they reach the next town.

Adare is identified as a Tier 3 settlement in the County Development Plan, there are

hundreds of people employed locally in the tourism, hospitality, retail, fashion and

service sectors. It is one of the premier tourist locations in the country and there is

no questioning that it should have two possible access points. To not provide the

village of Adare with two access points would be a retrograde step.

What I am proposing here today is that another interchange would service Croagh

and Adare.

Other comparable locations where such entry points have been accommodated are

Bunratty, Ennis and Nenagh. In the case of Nenagh the NRA, the Mid West Road
---
**7**

Design Office and North Tipperary County Council inserted a 3rd access point during

the upgrade of the M7 from single carriageway to motorway standard. This was to

facilitate improved access to the town of Nenagh and local access to Borrisoleigh to

address local fears and concerns.

There is very strong precedent set for including this proposed entry point at Croagh

and additional cases of this are evident in Quin, Crusheen and Barefield in Co. Clare

on the M18 and also at Cashel and Horse and Jockey in Co Tipperary on the M8.

Ladies and Gentlemen I think it is high time that all parties associated with the

design process of this project should sit back for a moment and reflect on the many

costly mistakes of the recent past in the whole area around road design and in doing

so begin to listen to the people and communities that have most to lose or gain. The

most pertinent instances of bad road design around this region are easily identified

at Roxboro, Ballysimon and Nenagh to name but a few, all of these projects were

designed under the umbrella of the Mid West Road Design Office based in Lissanalta

House. These people are not infallible.

When the village of Croagh was initially bypassed the locals worked hard to ensure

the community spirit remained and that the people of Croagh retained their identity.

Recent measures such as the traffic calming which I worked for along the N21 have

reduced speeds and made the village very accessible, attractive and a safe place to

live. While the economics of this project can be argued over and over again, at the

end of the day there has to be a balance found between infrastructural development

and local community.

The proposed Adare-Foynes road in its current form will once again by-pass the

village and create another physical division of the community.

The socio-economic implications of this proposed route will sound the death knell

for the area. A number of people will immediately be out of work if there is no

access point to the village identified. It is clear that compensation will be provided

where agricultural land is affected by a route.

Furthermore, I am requesting today that Limerick City & County Council carries out a

socio-economic impact assessment of the existing route as it pertains to all of the

surrounding areas. I am requesting that a proportion of the 2017 general municipal

allocation be set aside to fund this assessment and I am asking my colleagues from

the Adare-Rathkeale municipal area to unite with me in supporting this proposal.

Finally, I would ask that the Councillors receive regular updates at each of our

monthly meetings in Rathkeale on the progress being made on this motion and that

we reserve the right as a municipal area to bring this matter before a full meeting of

the Council again. Also I would propose that a progress report on this motion be

presented by the executive to the Full Council at the November Meeting of Limerick

City and County Council.”

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Galvin stressed the need to promote and

support small rural villages such as Croagh which would lose significant business and

connectivity if the access were not provided.

Other Members spoke in favour of the Motion, querying the high costs associated

with providing the additional access.

Concerns were also expressed by other Members regarding residents in Croagh that

may not want a junction in the village and that if an additional exit had to be provided, it

could impact on the scheme due to possible delays.

The Deputy Chief Executive responded by stating that the Council was in the middle

of an ongoing design process and that she had listened to the concerns as expressed by

the Members. She recommended that the public should arrange a meeting with the Project

Team in the Mid West National Road Design Office. She also confirmed that she would raise

these concerns with Transport Infrastructure Ireland with a view to achieving a satisfactory

solution.

On the proposal of Councillor Keary, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), it was

agreed to take a 10-minute adjournment.

On resumption, Councillor Keary proposed that Limerick City and County Council

support the connectivity of Croagh Village to the Limerick/Foynes road upgrade; that all

relevant technical, socio-economic, environmental expertise would be engaged by the

Council in both the design and implementation of the said interchange; and, furthermore,

that a Special Meeting of the Council be held on the same date as the November bi-monthly

Meeting, at which he would be requesting an advanced update on the design of the

proposed interchange.

The Motion, as outlined by Councillor Keary, was seconded by Councillor Galvin and

agreed.

Councillor Keary concluded by stating that he was disappointed with the lack of

response from the Executive in relation to the matter under discussion at the Meeting.

Disposal of Land

Circulated, copy of Statutory Notice dated 12th September, 2016, concerning disposal

of land at the Public Car Park, Rathkeale, Co. Limerick, together with report of the Deputy

Chief Executive dated 20th October, 2016.

The report stated that this matter had previously come before the Adare-Rathkeale

Municipal District in July 2015. It had subsequently received the approval of the Council at a

Special Meeting on 5th August, 2015, for a land exchange of similar value.
---
**9**

Difficulty arose in the administration of transfer of title to Limerick Community

Games. The issues had been rectified and the matter was returned to the Adare-Rathkeale

Municipal District Members for consideration and approval on 21st July 2016.

The report explained that the site was located to the rear of the property located on

Main Street, Rathkeale, which was in the ownership of Limerick Community Games. The

rear of the site formed a boundary with the south-western side of the Public Car Park.

Limerick Community Games had made a formal request to acquire a small portion of the

existing Public Car Park from the Council, measuring approximately 25.50 square metres.

The purpose of the request was to construct a storage shed for their equipment. Limerick

Community Games proposed to give Limerick City and County Council a larger area of land

that was within its ownership measuring approximately 108 square metres.

A number of conditions would apply to the transaction and these were outlined in

the report of the Deputy Chief Executive dated 20th October, 2016.

The Meetings Administrator clarified that there was no consideration payable for

this disposal which would involve an exchange of lands of similar value. In addition, a

resolution of the Council would be required to rescind previous resolution passed at Special

Meeting of the Council held on 5th August, 2015.

Proposed by Councillor Keary;

Seconded by Councillor McMahon;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the disposal of 25.50

square metres at the Public Car Park, Rathkeale, Co. Limerick, to the following: John

Dinnage, Main Street, Rathkeale, Co. Limerick; Anthony Fitzsimons, Shanagolden, Co.

Limerick; Padraig Gallagher, Newtown, Castletroy, Co. Limerick; Con Horan, Kyletaun,

Rathkeale, Co. Limerick; and Michael O’Brien, Carrigogunnell, Clarina, Co. Limerick, as

Trustees of Limerick Community Games, in exchange for the transfer of an area of land

measuring approximately 108 square metres, subject to the conditions outlined in the

report of the Deputy Chief Executive dated 20th October, 2016, and in accordance with

proposal agreed at Meeting of the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale held on 21st July,

2016, with all costs associated with the disposal to be borne by Limerick Community Games.

This resolution rescinds previous resolution passed at Special Meeting of the Council held on

5th August, 2015.”

This concluded the Meeting.

The report stated that the newly established Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic

Development DAC was tasked to plan and develop key strategic sites in Limerick City and

County that would act as anchors for enterprise and investment development across

Limerick. The 0.6 acre Gardens International site was located at Lower Henry Street and

had been acquired by Limerick City and County Council, together with the adjacent No.19

Henry Street property, in 2014 and it was currently being transferred to Limerick Twenty

Thirty Strategic Development DAC following a Section 183 approval by Council. Planning

permission had been secured for 112,000 sq. ft. of Grade A office accommodation. The

Gardens International site was ideally positioned to match current IDA requirements for

large-scale, knowledge-based enterprises to Limerick City Centre. The report stated that

construction works had commenced and it was intended that the development would be

completed during the second quarter of 2018.

The Council was being requested to consider approving application for sanction from

the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, in accordance with

Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, for a loan of €16m to finance

the development of the Gardens International. The loan would be structured to defer

principal payments for a number of years until the construction phase was completed and

the development occupied.

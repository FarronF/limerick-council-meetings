Following the presentation, the following issues were raised by the Members:

•

The importance of providing flood protection for Askeaton, Croom and Ballingarry.

•

Measures to protect farmland at risk in Ballysteen.

•

A bypass channel for the Shannon should be constructed to protect flood risk areas.

•

Introduction of a national programme for the regular maintenance of rivers and that

any such programme should be undertaken before areas are designated as flood

plains.

•

Insurance implications for property owners.

•

Reference was made to the Corbally flooding the previous winter and clarification

was sought on the agency responsible for the operation of the lock gates on the

canal. Importance of interagency cooperation was highlighted.

•

Could the flooding in Corbally be addressed in the Plan?

•

Are there proposals for works to be carried out on the Shannon adjacent to Condell

Road?

•

The question of flood protection measures for Athea and, in particular, the area in

the vicinity of the national school was raised.

•

The necessity of flood protection measures for Castleconnell and the need for the

Office of Public Works to work closely with the Council.

•

There were different rules on dredging being applied in different scenarios.

•

Are surveys carried out as part of the CFRAMS process available for the AFA's?

•

Clarification was sought as to whether the current requirement for planning

applicants to submit flood risk.

•

The lack of maintenance on rivers, including the lack of dredging, was affecting the

capacity of rivers.

•

Clarification was sought as to whether the current requirement for planning

applicants to submit flood risk assessments would be required in areas where flood

risk management plans were in place. It was noted that for one off houses flood risk

assessment was expensive.

•

How is Climate Change addressed in the CFRAMS process?

•

Floor levels in new builds should be raised where appropriate.

•

A query was raised with respect to isolated homes where individual property

resilience and protection measures were proposed. Who was responsible for the

welfare of the people occupying these properties and who would pay for the

proposed individual property protection measures?

•

Dredging programme in place by the OPW and how many dredgers had they in their

possession.

•

The necessity for more maintenance to be carried out by Waterways Ireland on the

Park Canal.

•

Are there plans to dredge the estuary as Cleeves Bank was overgrown and silt had

built-up?

•

Confirmation that the OPW had liaised with the National Parks and Wildlife Services

in relation to dredging as a possible alternative to capital infrastructure was sought.---
6

Mr. Adamson responded to some of the issues raised as follows:

In response to query on climate change, flood maps had been prepared for two

potential future scenarios, which then informed the assessment of potential measures for

managing the flood risk.

It was clarified that the FRMPs would not determine or prescribe land use zoning, as

this was a matter for the Planning Authorities, although the flood maps produced under the

CFRAM Programme could inform the application of the Guidelines on Planning and Flood

Risk Management (2009).

It was noted that setting minimum floor levels was also a matter for the Planning

Authorities.

Specific issues or concerns for particular communities should be included within the

submission from the Council in response to the consultation on the Draft FRMPs.

Regarding the maintenance of channels, it was explained that the Office of Public

Works had a planned maintenance regime that they implement for the Arterial Drainage

Schemes, and that the local authorities had a duty to maintain the Drainage Districts. It was

also stated that guidance was being prepared to assist riparian owners who wished to

undertake maintenance themselves.

Detailed reports on the technical analysis for the Areas for Further Assessment were

available on the National CFRAM website (www.cfram.ie).

Mr. Adamson thanked the Members and he then withdrew from the Meeting.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the issues raised by the Members would be

included in a submission on the matter to be prepared and submitted by the Physical

Directorate.

At this point, it was agreed on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by

Councillor Collins (M), to take a one-hour adjournment to consider matters related to the

next item on the Agenda, i.e. the Local Property Tax.

On resumption, it was agreed on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by

Councillor Collins (M), to take a further 30 minute adjournment.

Suspension of Standing Orders: On resumption of the Meeting, the Mayor drew attention

to the time and on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Collins

(M), Standing Orders were suspended in order to complete the agenda.---

Local Property Tax

Circulated, report of the A/Head of Finance dated 13th September, 2016, in relation

to Local Property Tax – Local Adjustment Factor 2017.

The A/Head of Finance advised Members that a Local Authority could, as a Reserved

Function, resolve to vary the basic rate of the Local Property Tax (LPT) within its functional

area by a maximum of +/- 15%. He added that any decision to vary the basic rate of LPT

must be taken by 30th September each year in order to take effect from 1st November (the

liability date) and therefore determine the LPT liability of taxpayers for the following year.

The following points were also noted:

• Local Property Tax (LPT) – consultation began on 8th July.

• Public consultation process regarding the LPT was advertised both on-line and in the

local media.

• Deadline for receipt of submissions was 17th August, 2016.

• No submissions received.

He added that Section 20 (2) of the Act set out a number of factors which the

Members should have regard to in making a decision of whether or not to vary the base rate

of LPT. These factors were set out in more detail, and in prescribed formats, in the Local

Property Tax (Local Adjustment Factor) Regulations 2014.

The factors which should be considered were set out as follows:

1. Estimation of Income and Expenditure for the period during which the rate

was to be varied.

2. The financial position of the Local Authority.

3. The Local Authority’s estimation of the financial effect of the LPT varied rate

on the economy of its functional area, including on those persons who would

be liable to pay LPT.

4. Report on Public Submissions.

5. Potential Impact on Service Delivery Plans of Local Authority.

It was noted that any 1% increase or decrease in 2017 LPT allocation was valued at

€156, 681. The potential value of a potential increase or decrease in 2017 LPT allocation, if

the maximum variation of 15% were implemented by the Council, was €2,350,215.

Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh proposed to vary the LPT basic rate downwards by 15% for 2017.

This proposal was seconded by Councillor Browne.

Councillor Collins (M) proposed an amendment that, in accordance with Section 20

of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act, 2012, to vary the LPT basic rate upwards by 10% for

2017. This proposal was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).---

Tourism, Leisure and Urban Renewal

Circulated, report of the A/Director, Social Development, dated 16th September,

communities and to support, develop and maintain quality recreational, cultural and civil

facilities. It was an objective of the Council to provide safe and sustainable communities

where people of all ages enjoy a good quality of life, a good home and a sense of pride in

their place.

The report stated that the development of high quality recreational and cultural

amenities and infrastructure would help to promote a welcoming and dynamic Limerick

which would value its heritage and culture.

A number of projects were listed in the report in addition to which the Limerick Local

Community Development Committee (LCDC) was overseeing the implementation of the

rural development programme which included Leader funding (to the value of €9.276

million up to 2020).

Raising of Loan

Circulated, report of the A/Director, Social Development, dated 16th September,

2016, seeking the Council’s approval to the raising of a loan of €1.7 million to undertake

refurbishment works at the Watergate Flats Complex, Limerick City Centre, consisting of 100

apartments constructed in 1969.

The report stated that the Watergate Apartment Complex was the Council’s only

large-scale inner city apartment complex. The refurbishment works would greatly improve

the aesthetic appearance and environmental efficiency of the 3 blocks and contribute

towards the revitalisation of the inner city-centre area. It was considered that the works

would have positive implications by helping to maintain the properties whilst improving the

living conditions of the residents; reducing the residents’ energy costs, as well as improving

the appearance of the prominent blocks in the city centre. The report proposed approval of

an application for sanction from the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local

Government, in accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as

amended, for a loan of €1.7 million under Section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous

8.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

I will ask at the next meeting if LCO Enterprise Development Company has prepared the

design frameworks for each of the strategic sites in the Limerick 2030 Plan and when these

would be presented to the Members of the Council.

REPLY:

The Council, in May, requested LCO Enterprise Development Company (now

Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development DAC) to prepare design

frameworks for each of the above-mentioned sites and other sites identified

in Limerick 2030. The purpose of the design frameworks is to identify the

optimum use mix and key urban design principles that should apply to their

development and to examine the business case for their development.

In respect of the Opera Site, Aecom, the appointed client’s representatives,

are currently reviewing the 2013 framework and examining the business case

that would underpin the development of the site. It is anticipated that this

review will be completed in the coming month and a briefing will be given

then. Work on the remaining frameworks will commence in the coming

weeks and the Council will receive a full update when they are completed.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

I will ask at the next Meeting can the Council provide a list of all Council-owned lands

which may be suitable for housing development and how many housing units they could

possibly comfortably fit.

REPLY:

An ‘Assessment for Selecting Sites for Social Housing” (ASH) was prepared by

Limerick City and County Council to identify sites for housing on lands in the

Council’s ownership in appropriate locations; assess their potential; and

when they are likely to be developed in line with the targets set out in the

Social Housing Strategy 2020. The methodology outlined in the ASH selected---
14

Limerick City and Newcastle West as ‘pilot’ settlements. Further analysis is

currently being undertaken for other Tier 2 and Tier 3 settlements such as

Kilmallock and Castleconnell.

The scope of this study highlights the potential of sites for social housing

against an agreed, objective and consistent methodology which seeks to

capture information on opportunities and constraints on sites within the

Council’s ownership as they currently exist.

As part of the pilot analysis, the ASH identified 23 sites in Limerick City within

the ownership of Limerick City and County Council which passed the Stage A

‘Strategic Constraints’ filter as follows:

It should be noted that the ASH does not allocate land for development or

indicate that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local

Government would necessarily support its development. The sites provide a

range of potential locations where residential development might be

considered suitable. The analysis undertaken in the ASH informs the

decision-making process on which sites are progressed to Capital Appraisal

Stage. Currently, there are 320 units approved by the Department under the

Housing Programme (excluding regeneration).

NOTICES OF MOTION

10.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council calls on the Minster

for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to introduce a scheme akin to

the ‘Works in Lieu Scheme/Grant' which has previously operated in the Local Authority

system to be made available to persons, especially first-time homeowners, to purchase

properties that need refurbishment to make a habitable home; this grant would be repaid

over a fixed term at a rate calculated to equal the deferential rent persons currently pay

for social housing; the Local Authority / State would have a lean on the property for the

fixed term of the repayments so as to safeguard against any sale or change in title of the

property during the term. This scheme would extend to revitalising our rural towns and

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Browne

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council support extending the opening period of

the Desmond Castle in Newcastle West to include April and all September to enable more

tourists visit Limerick.

In proposing the Motion to extend the season, Councillor Browne said that Desmond

Castle was currently open for a limited amount of time from late May to the end of August.

He added that, as numbers visiting the Castle were growing, there was a need for the

opening period to be extended to take in April and continue to the end of September.

The Motion was seconded by Council Collins (M), and it was agreed that it would be

forwarded to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.

REPLY:

Desmond Castle in Newcastle West is owned and managed by the Office of

Public Works (OPW). The Castle is open to the public every year from 25th

May to 7th September. The OPW provides a service whereby they open the

Castle outside of these opening times on request. However, the Economic

Development Department will progress talks with the OPW with a view to

extending the opening period to include April and all of September.---

conjunction with the proposed amendment to the Southern Environs Local Area Plan and

welcomed the commencement of works on the Mungret College site and the negotiations that

had taken place with Mungret GAA Club.

In response to queries raised by Members, the Senior Executive Planner clarified the following :-

 In relation to the submission made by the GAA requesting change of zoning and vehicular

access from the distributor road, which was under construction, this land was zoned for

open space and recreation use and vehicular access off the distributor road was not

acceptable as the Part 8 was already decided. However, access from the next phase of the

distributor road could be considered at a later date.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Elena Secas**

***following estates: Rathlinn in Castleconnell, Curragh Birin and Caislean Na hAbhann Phase 1***

***in Castletroy, and on completion of these works, immediately, start the formal process of***

***taking the three estates in charge.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas and seconded by Councillor Leddin.

In proposing the motion Councillor Secas indicated that she had raised this issue previously and

stressed the importance of works being carried out in this case.

**REPLY**:

**Rathlinn, Castleconnell & Caisleann na hAbhann** – The Council has received

payment of the bonds for these estates. The Council will now arrange for the

necessary works to be carried out. The formal taking in charge process will

commence once confirmation is received from our Roads and Water Service

Engineers that the estate is completed to a satisfactory standard for taking in

charge.

**Curragh Birin, Castletroy** – There are outstanding works to be completed in this

estate and there is no bond in place. A schedule of outstanding works and the

estimated cost for completing same will be required in order for the Council to

assess the amount of funding required to complete this estate to a satisfactory

standard for taking in charge.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the city's traffic wardens, during their operational hours,***

***prioritise the city centre area for illegal and dangerous parking on double yellow lines and in***

***the middle of the road.***

The motion was proposed by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

In proposing the motion, Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh highlighted the need for the smooth flow of traffic

through the city to encourage further business investment in Limerick and in view of proposals

to pedestrianise part of the city centre.

He noted that Wickham Street and the second lane of William Street were often blocked by

illegally parked vehicles and that there were also issues in relation to illegal parking in taxi ranks

and bus lanes.

**REPLY**:

Traffic Wardens are employed by Limerick City and County Council under the

provisions of Section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. This legislation empowers

Limerick City and County Council as a Roads Authority to make provision for the

management and control of on street parking and parking charges.
---

The Control and Management of traffic and on street parking is vital to enabling

the economy of the city, the safety of its residents and visitors, and to the

functioning of pedestrian and cycle mobility and public transport.

Currently Standard Operating Procedure requires Traffic Warden staff to deal with

in the ‘first instance’ the following categories of offence.

 Parking a vehicle in a manner in which it would interfere with the flow of

traffic or which obstructed or endangered other traffic.

 Parking on a footway / grass margin or median strip.

 Parking a vehicle in a disabled parking bay.

Traffic Warden staff must issue Fixed Charge Offence Notices only when they are

satisfied that an offence has been committed and must support their allegations

with evidence under Oath in the District and Circuit Court where prosecutions

fall within the realm of a criminal offence.

Currently there are five Traffic Wardens in Limerick City engaged to monitor and

enforce the above mentioned Bye Laws. Traffic Wardens are assigned to eleven

different ‘beats’ in the city and the environs to patrol, monitor and issue

appropriate Fixed Charge Notices for all offences encountered on these beats.

Traffic Wardens are rostered through these eleven beats on a cycle of one week.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District write to the Minister for***

***the Environment, Community and Local Government requesting that the government institute***

***a national programme to replace the current street lighting with more environmentally***

***friendly and cost effective LED lights.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville pointed out the potential for Ireland to face

extensive fines for failure to reach carbon emissions targets and noted that a national

programme to replace current street lighting with LED lights would reduce the country’s carbon

footprint and result in reduced electricity and maintenance cost in the provision of public

lighting.

Members generally supported the motion and suggested that the Council should monitor its

carbon footprint and that proposals in relation to same should be included in the Council’s

Social Plan. A view was also expressed that the cost of such a proposal was prohibitive and that

the white light emitted by LED lights in estates such as Briarfield, Castletroy were

indistinguishable from the lights of oncoming vehicles. The Senior Engineer undertook to

review the lighting in Briarfield.

The Director of Service, Transportation & Travel / Environment noted that the Sustainable

Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) was facilitating a Public Lighting Working Group to bring

forward best practice guidelines for energy efficient public lighting procurement and design and

acknowledged that, given the scale of public lighting, this was an issue that needed to be

addressed at a national level. In relation to carbon footprints, he noted that a presentation was
---
7

to be made to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee on foot of the COP21 Paris Climate

Conference.

In response to queries raised by Members the Senior Engineer noted that the use of LED

technology for public lighting was still developing but was improving in relation to bigger lights.

These units offered 30% to 40% savings on energy costs but were still expensive, with the price

depending on the quantity tendered for.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Council investigate the possibility of running a series***

***of outdoor cinema showings in the People's Park over this or next summer, as has been done***

***in Dublin and other areas.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that there was no cinema in the city centre

and his proposal could form part of a series of small events that would enhance the city. The

potential to use the Milk Market for cinema was noted by Members.

**REPLY**:

Outdoor cinema events were held successfully in the People's Park in 2014 as part

of the City of Culture. The Parks Department examined the possibility last

Summer but due to the very poor weather conditions throughout the Summer, it

was decided not to undertake a screening.

We will keep this under review for Summer 2016 and would hope to be able to

facilitate some cinema events.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by** **Councillor Jerry O’Dea**

***Given the importance of the planned National Children’s Hospital to*** ***so many families in the***

***Metropolitan District, I will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on the Minister for***

***Health to reverse the decision to locate the National Children's Hospital at St. James's Hospital***

***and locate the new Children's Hospital for all the children of Ireland at Connolly Hospital in***

***Blanchardstown.***

***The Connolly site offers 145 acres, vast space for expansion, easier access for children and***

***their families and extensive parking. The co-location with Connolly Hospital and the new***

***Rotunda Maternity Hospital will result in better clinical outcomes. It will be cheaper and faster***

***to build than on the St. James's site.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Dea and seconded by Councillor Crowley.

In proposing the motion Councillor O’Dea highlighted the construction challenges that would

have to be overcome on the confined urban site at St. James’ and noted that it would be

cheaper and safer to build at Connolly with access to adequate parking, parkland areas, proper

parent accommodation and an adjacent maternity hospital where high risk cases could be dealt

with and thereby ensuring the best care for both mother and child.

Some Members spoke in favour of the St. James’ site noting that a new children’s hospital was
---
8

first mooted in 1993 and was still not built and to change plans at this point would result in

further delays. They noted that many experts were in favour of the St. James’ site which, unlike

Connolly, had the backing of all medical specialities available on site.

It was agreed that the Mayor, in conjunction with Members who supported the St. James’ site,

would agree the text of a letter to be sent to the Minister for Health.

This concluded the Meeting.

And Resolved:

“That the draft Minutes, as circulated, be taken as read, adopted and signed”.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Councillor Teskey to the Meeting and wished him well in his role as a
new Councillor in the District.

Members expressed disappointment that the Part 8 for the Proposed N21 Adare Western
Approach Improvement Scheme had proceeded in spite of the issues they had raised in relation to
the need to lay a sewerage pipe as part of the works and the need to provide a footpath from
Adare to Adare GAA grounds. It was suggested that the Council put in place a plan for this
footpath which could be implemented over a practical period. It was also suggested that the
Council should install the sewerage pipes and recover the costs from Irish Water, at a later date.

The Director, Regional Services made the following points in response to issues raised by
Members.

¢ The Council had secured approval for extra works under this project and the Part 8 had
been advanced to facilitate, in particular, works on the proposed car park during the
summer.

¢ Members concerns had been taken on board as far as possible but Irish Water had made it
clear that the laying of a sewerage pipe along the route did not form part of their current
priorities. The council would, however, continue to engage with Irish Water in this regard.

¢ Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TIl) had made it clear that a footpath from Adare to the
Adare GAA grounds would not be funded as part of the scheme. Contact would, however,
be made with the Roads Department of the Council in relation to the possibility of laying a
footpath from Adare to Adare GAA grounds, over a period, and she would revert to
Members in relation to same. A Part 8 in relation to this footpath could be brought
forward when appropriate but would be subject to agreement with local land owners.

¢ The provision of a push button pedestrian crossing at the post office in Adare would be
reviewed.

e Following the Public Consultation process a report would be compiled containing the views
of the public and responses to same and this would be brought before the Members for

consideration.

A request was made that a written schedule of works to be undertaken in conjunction with the
Part 8 be made available to Members.

2. Deputation from the Community Crisis Response Team

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from the Community Crisis Response Team which

travel to meet with a person who was suicidal. She pointed out that there were 20 volunteers

UESTIONS

7. Question submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

| will ask at the next Meeting when will the Road Department insist that all roadside hedgerows
in the District are maintained to allow the safe passage of all road-users.

REPLY: In the West Division the hedges on the Regional road junctions are cut annually.
Local roads junctions which are high risk are also cut. The works also provide for
cutting around the signs at the junctions. The Contract for this work will be
awarded this week and it is intended this work will be carried out over the next 8-
10 weeks.

The Roads Act, 1993 obliges landowners and occupiers of land to take all
reasonable care to ensure that the trees, ditches, hedges and other vegetation
growing on their land are not or could not become a danger to people using or
working on a public road. As such, the onus is placed on landowners/occupiers of
land to keep their hedges cut.

The Wildlife Act, 1976, prohibits hedge-cutting between 1° March and 31” August
each year except in certain circumstances.

The Local Authority can serve a written notice to the owner or occupier requiring
action to be taken in order to remove the danger or potential danger. The Local
Authority can carry out the works specified in the notice itself in any case where the
person on whom the notice is served fails to comply. It is an offence not to comply
with the terms of a notice served by the Local Authority. 270 letters were issued in
this regard last year. We have issued letters to some landowners on the R518 this
week. As there are approx 940km of roads in the Municipal District of Adare-
Rathkeale it is not possible to issue letters to all landowners. However, as
complaints arise the Council investigates the issues and issue notices if warranted.

8. Question submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

| will ask at the next Meeting that adequate funding be provided by the Council to the Adare-
Rathkeale District in order that basic road maintenance standards can be achieved in the
District, in the interest of public health and safety.

REPLY:

This year the total budget allocation for road maintenance for the Municipal District
of Adare-Rathkeale amounts to approx €3.66m of which approx 60% is provided
from the Department of Transport, Tourism & Sport (DTTAS) in the form of Grants.
The balance is provided by own resources in the adopted budget. This is to be
presented as part of the Schedule of Municipal District Works at the April Municipal
District Meeting. This funding provides for an allocation of €480,000 for Severe
Weather Funding towards repairs caused by the inclement Winter weather. This
funding was not available last year. There is no additional funding available to the
Operations Services Department from own resources. However we intend to make
an application for the 2™ tranche of Severe Weather funding to the DTTAS.

9. Question submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

I will ask at the next Meeting as to why a small business person, who has and needs a
commercial van for their business, is no longer allowed to tax their vehicle at the commercial
rate because they are exempt from doing a VAT return.

REPLY:

As per Circular Letter MT4/2010 issued on 10" August 2010:

. a licensing authority must be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed, the

applicant,.... should be asked for supporting documentation which can include but is not
limited to -

evidence of registration for VAT

a Tax Clearance Certificate

a commercial insurance certificate

a copy of their “Notice of Tox Registration Form” ”

In short it is up to the Authorised officer in motor tax to satisfy themselves that the
applicant is entitled to tax their vehicle at the goods rate. Limerick City and County
Council requires an applicant to provide documentation from the Revenue office which
indicates a person is currently trading commercially. Any one of the following will
suffice:

A Revenue Notice of Assessment, Income Tax Returns, Tax Clearance Certificate
(company name) etc. are some of the items required and not primarily a VAT return.
Just one item of documentation from Revenue (within a year from date of issue) is

required.

If an applicant is VAT exempt there are other options available to them.

NOTICES OF MOTION

11. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

I will move at the next Meeting, in light of the housing crisis, that an audit is carried out, without
delay, of all Council properties in the Adare-Rathkeale District to identify properties that can be
used to somewhat alleviate the problem. It is clear, having canvassed much of County Limerick
recently, that there are hundreds of vacant properties available to the Council throughout the

County.

Councillor O'Donoghue, in proposing the Motion, pointed out that while canvassing he noticed 2
lot of vacant properties in the county. He expressed the view that in certain cases tenants are no
longer living in Council property and the Council should investigate by seeking ESB Bills/refuse
collection bills to prove the house was occupied. He suggested that these vacant units could be
used to alleviate the housing crisis in the county.

In seconding the Motion Councillor Sheahan indicated that many houses were vacant in the main
street of towns and villages and suggested that incentives and grants should be given to renovate
vacant houses. It was further suggested by Members that the Council should purchase such
properties for letting. Members also noted that the Council had to reject the long term lease of
many properties with insufficient BER rating and suggested that the Council should upgrade such
properties and reflect the cost of the upgrade in the rent.

Councillor Sheahan called on Government to grant Building Society Licences to Credit Unions to
enable Credit Unions to give mortgages to their customers. This was seconded by Councillor
O'Donoghue and it was agreed that the Government and the Minister for Finance should be

written to in this regard.

The Director, Regional Services, pointed out that if Members had information that Council
properties were vacant they should notify the Council. In response to an enquiry from Members
the Director, Regional Services undertook to update the Members on the provision of additional
social housing in Adare.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council should, as a matter of
urgency, relinquish all rights to protected burial grounds in the Adare-Rathkeale District, as it
appears to be not willing or able to manage and maintain the upkeep of same to a minimum
standard that benefits the owners and the deceased occupiers of these cemeteries.

Councillor Keary, in proposing the Motion, indicated that damage had been caused to the gable
wall of the church at Clonshire Cemetery five years ago which lead to its collapse and caused
damage to a number of gravestones which had not been repaired. He called on the Council to
remove the stones and added that there were plots within the church walls which were not now

accessible.
The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

The Director, Regional Services, noted that this was a complex issue and that there were
archaeological and conservations requirements to be met in this case.

REPLY: | understand that the Notice of Motion refers to Clonshire Cemetery. Damage was
caused to the gable end of the Church at Clonshire Cemetery by a member of the
public. The damage resulted in collapse of wall into the body of the church.

Repair works to the church will entail —

¢ The surveying, recording, retrieval of missing pieces from the detached
tumbled debris
Numbering of the stone from the west gable
Removal from the body of the church to an adjacent area in the graveyard

e Rebuilding of the church

It is estimated that the cost of the repair works is in the region of €100,000. The
Council will arrange to carry out works should funding be provided.

The Council has received request from one family affected by damage caused to
their headstone. We were able to facilitate them without disturbing the fallen

gable.

Members queried the estimated cost of resolving this issue and called on the Council to take the
necessary measures to clear the rubble from the church floor and make the building safe.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

I will move at the next Meeting that this committee would agree to adopt a policy which would
prioritise the issues pertaining to Road Safety such as the putting in place of suitable and
adequate pedestrian crossings, speed ramps, footpaths & lighting. We should be influenced for
the safety of young people using schools and sports facilities and we should be influenced by the

---

8

needs of the elderly people at Churches, Doctors Surgeries etc. When we adopt this policy it
should be forwarded to the Engineering Section of Limerick City & County Council & also the
Finance Department of the Council.

Councillor Sheahan, in proposing the Motion, indicated that in the interest of safety for both the
young and the elderly a policy on road safety needed to be agreed. The Motion was seconded by

Councillor O’Brien.

REPLY: The Council will later this year be developing a Road Safety Action Plan. The issues
raised -particularly in relation to vulnerable road users- will obviously need to be
assessed as part of that process. Furthermore future design projects will need-to
include enhanced consideration for such vulnerable road users over the range of

activities.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale calls on the
Government and the acting Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner, in view of the
expressed wishes of the people and the misbehaviour of significant numbers of people and the
misbehaviour of significant numbers of people in Askeaton, that Askeaton Garda Station would

be fully staffed at the first available opportunity.

Councillor Sheahan, in proposing the Motion, expressed his concern regarding the lack of a fully
operational and fully staffed Garda Station in Askeaton. He added that residents were concerned
with anti social behaviour in the Askeaton area and called on the Minister for Justice and the
Garda Commissioner to fully re-open Askeaton Garda Station.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Keary who indicated that there were insufficient Garda
numbers throughout the District.

Members supported the Motion and praised the efforts of the existing Gardai in the District. They
called for additional support from the Crime Office and for retired Gardai to be used as an auxiliary
force, in place of the Garda reserve.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

| will move at the next Meeting that this District calls for the installation, on a trial basis, of CCTV
monitoring in designated areas of the Adare-Rathkeale District to assist in the prevention and

detection of rural crime.

Councillor O’Brien, in proposing the Motion, called for the installation, on a trial basis of CCTV in
Askeaton and pointed out that CCTV acts as a deterrent against crime and assists in the
prosecution of crime. The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan who pointed out that staff
would be required to view the tapes. Members requested that the Motion be forwarded to the

Joint Policing Committee (JPC).

16. Correspondence

Correspondence was noted.

The following items were discussed at the conclusion of the Agenda with the consent of the
Cathaoirleach.

It was agreed that a Deputation from St. Joseph’s Boys National School would be invited to attend
and give a presentation at the next Meeting.

Councillor Sheahan pointed out that the new Cemeteries Bye-Laws 2015, which were passed by
Council in September 2015, were being enforced too rigorously and people were being prevented
from putting down kerbing in old graveyards where kerbing was already in place. He proposed
that the current burial ground bye-laws be amended to permit the standard of maintenance and
structure of headstones and kerbing that applied in graveyards for a period in excess of twenty
years. The Motion was seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

Members raised concerns regarding traffic safety issues where the R523 joins the N21 at Reens,
with signs blocking vision on both sides and the removal of lane marking that had previously been

in place.

Members noted that the bottle bank in Ballingarry had not been replaced after footpath
reinstatement works and requested that every effort be made to find an appropriate location in

Ballingarry for same.

Councillor O’Donoghue referred to hedges which had not been cut on the Rathkeale Ballingarry
Road and the Operations Manager confirmed that a notice had been served on the landowner in

this regard.

Concerns were raised in relation to safety issues at a bend in Shanagolden and it was requested
that the roads engineer would examine same and revert back to the Members.

(e)

Commercial Rates Arrears

The A/Head of Finance/Human Resources/Corporate and ICT presented to the

Meeting, by way of a PowerPoint Presentation, an analysis of the Commercial Rates Arrears

at 31st December, 2015. The collection rate for 2015 showed a significant improvement,

increasing to 71%, which was up 6% on the 2014 year-end. The arrears at the end of 2015

were €21.4 million, a reduction of €3.5m or 14% on the previous year.

An analysis of the arrears figure identified that over 80% of the arrears related to

ratepayers with a rate warrant less than €20,000. In particular, the level of arrears was

highest for ratepayers with a warrant of less than €5,000.

The introduction by the Council of the Tourism Support Scheme in 2015 had been

very successful and that was highlighted by the Hotel category which showed a reduction in

the level of arrears of 55% or €1.37m. The Retail Sector accounted for 36% of arrears.

Following requests from the Councillors during the budget process and taking the above

analysis, the A/Head of Finance proposed the following Arrears Support Scheme to continue

the drive to reduce arrears.

***Proposed Once-off*** *Support Scheme for 2016 to address* ***arrears at 1**st*** ***February*** *for*

*Customers with annual warrant less than €20,000:*

 *4% support if arrears at 1**st* *February cleared by July 2016 and / or by*

*December 2016 if paid by Direct Debit.*
---
**11**

 *3% support if arrears at 1**st* *February cleared by December 2016.*

 *2% support if arrears at 1**st* *February cleared by April 2017 and / or by*

*December 2017 if paid by Direct Debit.*

The Scheme above also encouraged the use of electronic forms of payment for rates.

Direct Debit provided Small Businesses with the ability to pay their rates over 11 equal

instalments over the year. In cases where there was no engagement with the ratepayer, the

Council would have no option but to pursue the legal route for recovery of rates.

It was considered that this scheme, combined with the Small and Medium Business

Support Scheme 2016, would provide continuing support for the Business Sector.

Proposed by Councillor Collins (J);

Seconded by Councillor Browne;

And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 66 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as

amended, the Arrears Support Scheme for 2016, as outlined by the A/Head of Finance in his

PowerPoint Presentation and as set out above, be and is hereby adopted.”

Economic Development and Strategic Planning Directorate

Hanging Gardens Development

Circulated, report of the Director of Economic Development and Planning dated 10th

March, 2016.

The report firstly gave the background to the project. It stated that the *‘**Limerick*

*2030* *–* *An Economic and Spatial Plan,**’* which had been adopted by Council in June 2013, set

a target of creating 12,000 jobs (5,000 in the city centre) through the identification and

development of a number of strategic / transformational projects in the City. The report

explained that the timelines for the Hanging Gardens Project had proven difficult to meet

and needed to be advanced at a much quicker pace. The Council’s experience of using LCO

Limited as the SPV (special purpose vehicle) in the development of Troy Studios proved it to

be a very effective development vehicle. It was intended to use that experience and that

vehicle (LCO) to fast-track the advancement of the Hanging Gardens Project.

The report stated that LCO Limited was a wholly owned company of Limerick City

and County Council. The proposal was that the Council formally transfer the asset to the

Council’s wholly owned LCO company under the Section 183 process to enable the project

to move forward. The Council would then be in a position to recruit and allocate the

necessary resources to advance the project which had to date restricted its progress.

The report recommended to the Council the approval of the Section 183 transfer. In

this regard, copy of Statutory Notice dated 10th March, 2016, concerning the disposal of
---
**12**

land at 16-19 Henry Street, Limerick City, had already been circulated and had been noted at

a recent meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick.

Councillor Collins (J), in formally proposing the report and recommendation, said

that while the Council was not a developer, it had procured this site to progress the

economic, social and physical life in the city. He welcomed that the tender process for any

works would be open to the local economy. It was noted that once works were completed,

the development could facilitate 750 people being employed in the city. He concluded by

stating that the Council was using LCO Limited, which was a special purpose vehicle

company, as it was allowed greater flexibility and opportunity.

In supporting the report and recommendation, Councillor Browne stated that this

was an investment that needed to be made and added that it was a decision that was being

made in the best interests of Limerick.

A short discussion ensued with the majority of the Members welcoming the proposal

and a number of queries in relation to the proposal were responded to by the Chief

Executive and the Director, Economic Development and Strategic Planning.

Proposed by Councillor Collins (J);

Seconded by Councillor Browne;

And Resolved:

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the disposal of property

consisting of 0.2478 hectares situate at 16-19 Henry Street, Limerick City, to LCO Local

Enterprise Development Company Limited, for the nominal sum of €1, in accordance with

the particulars as set out in Statutory Notice dated 10th March, 2016.”

Circulated, report of the Arts and Culture Officer, Limerick 2020 Bid, dated 2nd

March, 2016, enclosing Schedule setting out the applications recommended for grant

assistance under the Arts Act, 2003.

on the basis of the criteria for the allocation of the Arts Grants under the Arts Act, 2003. The

approval of the Council was being requested to the payment of grants as set out on the

Schedule attached to the report.

Proposed by Councillor Hourigan;

Seconded by Councillor Mitchell;

And Resolved:
---
**13**

“That, the approval of the Council be and is hereby given to the payment of grants

under the Arts Act, 2003, as recommended and as set out on the Schedule attached to the

report of the Arts and Culture Officer, Limerick 2020 Bid, dated 2nd March, 2016.”

Congress Charter for Fair Conditions of Employment

The Mayor and Members welcomed Mr. David Joyce from the Irish Congress of

Trade Unions who was present to give a presentation on the Congress Charter for Fair

Conditions of Employment. Mr. Joyce firstly outlined the background as follows:

 Congress had become concerned that during the economic crisis, there had been

significant growth in the use of low paid, low hour and insecure contracts of

employment.

 The Congress had become convinced that it needed to develop a consensus across

society that workers had an entitlement to fair conditions of employment.

 Congress had identified five core entitlements that it intended to campaign to have

implemented. Those entitlements made up the Congress Charter for Fair Conditions of

Employment.

He then outlined that the Congress Charter consisted of the following:

 A Living Wage.

 Fair Hours of Work.

 Right to Representation and Collective Bargaining.

 Respect, Equality and Ethics at Work.

 Fair Public Procurement.

He added that the campaign began in the Oireachtas in April 2015 and that since then the

progress was as follows:

 Met the vast majority of TDs, Senators and MEPs.

 Over 130 individual pledges of support.

 Motion passed in the Seanad.

 Clear majority support in new Dáil.

 Current focus on Local Authorities and their Elected Members:

o Met with CCMA.

o Wrote to each Local Authority Chief Executive.

o Wrote to each City and County Councillor.

He stated that the ‘asks’ from City and County Councillors were the following:

1. That Local Authority Members pledge their support for the Charter.

2. That they put down a Motion at their own Council Meeting seeking Council support

for the Charter.
---
**14**

3. That a Congress representative be invited to address a meeting of Councillors.

In explaining the progress in Local Authorities, he mentioned the following:

 100s of individual pledges of support so far.

 Meetings held or planned with 12 Local Authorities.

 8 Motions in support of the Charter.

 Aiming to get majority during first half of 2016.

He added that the next stages of the campaign would be as follows:

 The aim of the campaign was to build a consensus that the aims of the Congress

Charter should be a reality, as a minimum for every worker in Ireland.

 Also seeking support from employers and other civil society groups.

At the conclusion of the presentation, the Mayor asked Mr. Joyce to forward to the

Council a draft motion in support of the Congress Charter for Fair Conditions at Work. He

added that this would be considered at a Party Leaders’ meeting and would then be tabled

for discussion at the next Full Council Meeting.

The Mayor and Members were in support of fair conditions of employment and

thanked Mr. Joyce for his very informative presentation. Mr. Joyce then withdrew from the

Meeting.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Prendiville

I will ask at the next Meeting is there any exemption or discounted standing charge for

water rates available for charities and voluntary organisations who are struggling on

reduced budgets.

**REPLY:**

There is no exemption or discount available for water charges to charities

and voluntary organisations.

Irish Water has now the statutory responsibility for providing and developing

water services throughout Ireland. Limerick City and County Council provide,

on an agency basis, the billing and collection function for this local authority

area and therefore any exemption or discount on water charges has to be

approved by Irish Water.

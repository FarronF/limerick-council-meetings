As there were no other nominations, the Mayor declared Mr. John Costelloe co-

opted as a Member of the Council for the Metropolitan District of Limerick and welcomed

him as a Member of the Council.

Councillor Costelloe then took his seat in the Chamber.

Councillor Costelloe addressed the Meeting by saying that it was a great honour and

privilege for him to become a Member of Limerick City and County Council. He said it had

been a long, hard road for him to get to this point. He added that he was honoured and

humbled and paid tribute to his predecessor, former Councillor Maurice Quinlivan, who had

been a great support to him. He pointed out that the role was completely new to him but

that he looked forward to the challenges ahead and, in particular, made reference to the

housing crisis and the number of suicides occurring in the Limerick region. He concluded by

thanking his proposer and seconder and the Members for their welcome and kind words of

encouragement.

The Mayor and Members congratulated and extended a very warm welcome to

Councillor Costelloe wishing him well in his new role and future political career. Tributes

were also paid to Deputy Maurice Quinlivan.

The Deputy Chief Executive, on behalf of Management and Staff, joined in

congratulating Councillor Costelloe and welcomed him to Limerick City and County Council

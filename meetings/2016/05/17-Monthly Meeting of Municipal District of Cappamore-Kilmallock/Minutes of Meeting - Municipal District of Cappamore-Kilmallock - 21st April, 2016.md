A Reply to the following Question submitted by Councillor B. Teefy at Meeting held on Friday,

11th March, 2016 was submitted to the Meeting :

***I will ask at the next Meeting when is the Speed Limit Review being carried out and to***

***outline the procedure for same.***

**REPLY**:

It is the intention of the Council to commence the formal speed limit review

within the next fortnight. The speed limit review will form the basis for the

introduction of revised bye laws by the Members as soon as the statutory

requirements, including public consultation and consideration of submissions

received, are complete.

The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport recently published Guidelines

for Setting and Managing Speed limits in Ireland and the procedure for making

bye laws is set out at Page 24 of this document.

The Guidelines require the Council to undertake a number of steps and the

Council will be commencing the pre consultation phase, which will include

notifying the Members of the commencement of the process and inviting

submissions from the Members in relation to areas where they may be of the

opinion that current limits should be reviewed.

In this regard, I would also advise the Members that the Council is currently

examining submissions on file where representations have previously been

made.

The current speed limits will be reviewed and any proposed amendments

developed in the context of the guidance issued by the Department.

The formal process in relation to the making of bye laws, as referred to above,

require the Council to undertake the following steps:

 A pre draft consultation phase with Members, An Garda Siochana, NRA,

adjoining Local Authorities etc

 The placing of a report setting out both submissions received and proposed

amendments on the Agenda for a meeting of each District.

 Elected Members consider the submissions and proposed amendments

 Preparation of Draft bye laws

 Public Consultation phase

 Consideration of objections and submissions received and preparation of

report for the Elected Members. Report should include comments from An

Garda Siochana.

 Elected Members consider the report

 Revised Draft Bye Laws

 Adoption by Elected Members of the Local Authority.

Desmond Hall

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Mr. Padraig O’Ruairc, Regional Manager, Shannon Region
Heritage Sites, who gave a presentation on Desmond Hall, Newcastle West.

Mr. O’Ruairc stated that visitor numbers to the 13” Century Castle had risen from
around 2,000 in 2005 to 11,150 in 2015. He also stated that as a result of signage being
erected, numbers had increased, however the present location of signage was confusing
for visitors. It was outlined that there was potential to grow numbers to 20,000. He
stated that 16,000 people a day travelled through Newcastle West between Adare and
Killarney at the height of the tourist season. An increase in visitor numbers to the castle
would only come about with proper road signage, car parking and coach parking
facilities. He also stated that a Tourist Office in the town was essential to grow tourism in
the region.

Mr. O’Ruairc also spoke of the proposal by the Office of Public Works to rename the

Gaeltacht and to the Office of Public Works to retain the name of Desmond Hall.

Members thanked him for his presentation and it was suggested that contact would be
made with Failte Ireland, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and Bus Eireann as a matter of
urgency due to the commencement of the tourist season. Following general discussion
the Director of Services stated that this was a very worthwhile presentation and that
there was a need to promote tourism in Newcastle West and the surrounding area.

The Roads Engineer stated that he had had a meeting with Fr. O’Shea in Abbeyfeale and
outlined the concerns of residents in the estate with regard to parking in the vicinity of

church for car parking but this was not agreeable to the church as no funding was
available to them to develop the site.

the only option. It was proposed to bring the matter to public consultation.

survey traffic flow at three pinch points, namely, Bridge Street, Newcastle West,

roundabout systems at each location so as to enable the smooth flow of traffic locally.

forwarded to Transport Infrastructure Ireland. He also stated that a detailed submission

reviewed. Councillor Collins seconded the Motion.

10.

Ireland relating to the traffic situation in Newcastle West and the need to look at

which recently have been re-tabled as priorities for Limerick City and County
Council.

bad repair after the flooding. Councillor Collins seconded the Motion.

application for €370,000 for repair to roads, however, only €300,000 had been allocated
to the District. Members stated that this amount was inadequate in light of the
allocation of €4m to the whole Council. It was suggested that Members submit list of
damaged roads requiring repair for consideration and the matter be put on the Agenda
for the next Meeting of the District.

In relation to query relating to temporary staff the Operations Manager stated that it
was hoped to have these staff in place by the beginning of April, 2016.

the repair of roads which were damaged during the recent bad weather. Funding

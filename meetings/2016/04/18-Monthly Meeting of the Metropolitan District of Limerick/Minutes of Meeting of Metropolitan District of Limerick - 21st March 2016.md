Dr. Ring gave an overview of the vision, mission, strategic objectives and membership strands of

Limerick Chamber and in relation to the hospitality strand of the Chamber highlighted a number

of strategic action points which included :

 The representation of Limerick Chamber on key Council Committees to assist in driving the
---

economic revitalisation of the city as a catalyst for the region.

 To co-lead, with the Council, the efforts to achieve Limerick’s Purple Flag.

 To run a series of action orientated workshops to address the needs of retail / hospitality in

the city centre.

 The installation of a town city manager, based in the city, to proactively address retail /

hospitality issues.

 To lead a Limerick city centre deep clean project.

 To set up and run one major festival in Limerick.

 To establish a fund to market Limerick city centre.

In relation to marketing, Dr. Ring referred to a joint marketing fund that was to be established

with €20,000 from the Council, €10,000 from the Chamber and a further €10,000 to be raised

from the fees of new members joining the Chamber. This fund would be used to market a range

of activities that occur in Limerick with a special focus on weekend activity and innovative events

that were to be planned.

Mr. Ring also raised the need for traders to have a single point of contact within the Council.

Members thanked Dr. Ring for his presentation and welcomed the establishment of a joint

marketing fund.

The following points were made by various Members during discussion of this item :

 That all efforts to strengthen the Council’s relationship with the Chamber should be

welcomed.

 Clarity needed to be provided in relation to budgets and responsibilities for festivals and

event management and this should be further explored by the Council and Limerick

Chamber. The establishment of a fund, with contributions from special projects under the

GMA, should be considered in this regard.

 The need to revitalise some of the Georgian Buildings in the city.

 The need to liaise with the Chamber in relation to a night time strategy for the city and the

co-ordination of late opening of shopping outlets.

 The need to get all stakeholders on board in developing and promoting the city and to be

aware of each others plans and proposals.

 The Wild Geese, which marked the beginning of the diaspora, has societies all over the world

and should be marked by a major festival in the city.

 The need for park and ride facilities to be developed to encourage more people into the city.

 The need for a series of small events such as outdoor cinema to be staged and the potential

of Nicholas Street to be developed as Artists Studios.

 The need for the marketing of Limerick to be fully addressed and to build on the legacy of

the City of Culture.

 That the proposed new footbridge for the city is not needed and should not be built.

 That customers in the city should be surveyed, as part of a marketing strategy, to establish

their views in relation to a range of issues pertinent to the city.

 Suggestions in relation to the appointment of a city centre manager were positive but

support staff would also be required.

In response to issues raised by Members, Dr. Ring made the following points :

 A meeting was planned between the Chamber and the Council in relation to proposals to

pedestrianise streets in the city and the Chamber would naturally have concerns in relation

to the length of time any such works would take.

 In relation to parking, the focus should be on ensuring the turnover of spaces and the

Chamber would anticipate that free parking would result in an increase in rates for its

members.

 While shuttered closed premises were less aesthetic and prevented window shopping,

security had to be taken into consideration.

 Late opening was a matter for each trader and could only be achieved through agreement.

There was potential to develop Sunday as family day in the city.

The Director, Transportation & Travel / Environment noted that he was the contact point for

Limerick Chamber. In relation to Christmas parking in the city, he pointed out that this was a

complex issue and agreed to include the Chamber in a workshop on same, which he had already

committed to having with the District Members.

Following a query from Members, the Senior Planner updated Members in relation to the status

of the Opera Site and the Cleeves Site.

**3.**

**Disposal of Land**

Members noted the proposals for the disposal of land as follows :-

 Disposal of Freehold Interest in dwelling house situate at 13 Quins Cottages, Rosbrien in the

City of Limerick.

 Disposal of 150 square metres of land at Rathmale, Mungret, Co. Limerick.

 Disposal of 54 square metres of waste land at the rear of property, 7 Beechgrove, Newtown

Park, Castletroy.

 Disposal of Property known as the Hanging Gardens to the LCO Local Enterprise

Development Company Limited. The Company is wholly owned by Limerick City & County

Council.

In response to queries raised by Members in relation to the Hanging Gardens site, the Senior

Planner informed Members that the building was in excess of 114,000 square feet and would

accommodate up to 750 employees. He noted that a briefing from the Design Team would be

given to Members in advance of the Part VIII going on public display and that it was intended

that contractors would be on site in 2016. With regard to the proposed disposal of the property

to the Local Enterprise Development Company Limited, he informed Members that this was a

special purpose vehicle which offered more flexibility, agility and risk sharing.

In response to queries raised by Members in relation to the Cleeves Site, the Senior Planner

noted that the main building, the chimney and a reservoir were listed and that other parts that

merited conservation would be conserved.

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next meeting if there is a proposed timeline for the pedestrianisation of***

***Limerick City Centre.***

**REPLY**:

Throughout Limerick City Centre the Council seeks to achieve an appropriate

balance between various traffic forms -pedestrian, cyclist, public transport and

other vehicles- as required by each location.

The previously completed Howley's Quay is an example of a transformation

which has increased the relative prominence of pedestrian movements vis-a-vis

vehicular movements.

Later this year works will begin on Davis Street which-while maintaining two way

vehicular movements-will also provide enhanced facilities for pedestrians and

cyclists.

This year the Council received notification of an ERDF grant of €4m towards the

revitalisation of O'Connell Street area- with this money to be drawn down by the

end of 2018. The Council will soon be seeking tender for Consultants to assist

in the delivery of this project and will be engaging with sectoral interests to

achieve the appropriate balance of treatments for the general O'Connell Street

area.

The overall delivery of vehicular traffic management within Limerick City Centre

will depend on the delivery of the Inner Orbital Route aspects of which remain to

be delivered.

**Question submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if there is a timeline for when the long expected community***

***centre for the Garryowen area will be provided and are there any temporary measures***

***planned in the interim, as the current space will not be available from the middle of this year?***

**REPLY**:

Limerick City and County Council is very supportive of the community in

Garryowen and its many supporters and advocators in developing a community

facility. Towards this end, the Council via its Regeneration Programme, are in on-

going discussions in order to find a suitable location that best suits the needs of

the overall area of Garryowen. It is hoped to achieve progress in this matter

during the Summer months.

Regarding Garryowen CDP, meetings have taken place and the Council is making

efforts to assist in securing short-term accommodation to meet the needs of that

programme.

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next meeting if there is a plan and timetable for moving the City Centre Library***

**REPLY**:

of Environment, Community and Local Government that approval in principle has

been granted for a new Central Library for Limerick under the new Library Capital

Investment Programme 2016 – 2021.

---
7

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin noted that the process involved in the development

of social housing can take up to three years and the Council should take a more proactive

approach by giving Housing Associations or builders an opportunity to build houses on our

behalf and lease same back to the Council.

Councillor Gilligan indicated his support for the motion as it offered an opportunity to work

around the current deadlock.

Other Members spoke against the motion indicating that the private model did not satisfy the

needs of ordinary people and reservations were expressed that this proposal might result in

increased profits for builders.

The Project Manager, Regeneration informed Members that the Home and Social Development

Directorate were looking at all options as to how to best progress the various sites in the

Council’s ownership from a housing perspective and achieve the targets set out in the Social

Housing Stategy 2020. He noted that a variety of funding mechanisms and instruments were

being investigated including :

 Sale and lease back.

 Direct delivery.

 Part V, with the potential to take units rather than a financial contribution.

 Turn key such as at Wallers Well.

 Social leasing.

 Approved housing bodies.

 Direct purchase.

In conclusion, the Project Manager, Regeneration noted that a presentation on available sites

would be made to the Home and Social Development SPC and the Mayor indicated that the

motion should be discussed further at that forum.

**10.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will move at the next meeting that the Limerick Regeneration programme cease the***

***demolition of void domestic Council dwellings, other than those which are a safety issue.***

***I propose that the funding for demolition of domestic dwellings, be reallocated instead, to***

***building urgently required Social Housing.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Prendiville.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller noted the extent of boarded up houses in the

regeneration areas and the perception that there were more houses being demolished than

built.

**REPLY**:

The demolition and retention strategy being implemented in the four

regeneration areas of Limerick city is in accordance with the Limerick

Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) adopted by the elected

members of Limerick City Council in February 2014. This plan significantly

reduced the extent of demolition proposed in the 2008 Regeneration Masterplan.

In line with the commitment in the LRFIP for monitoring and review of the

programme, a review of the demolition and retention strategy took place in 2015.

This review proposes further reduction in the overall number of houses to be

demolished and will be presented to the Elected Members at the next meeting.

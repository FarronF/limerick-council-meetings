Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Jerry O’Dea

Given the importance of the planned National Children’s Hospital to so many families in
the Metropolitan District, | will move at the next Meeting that this District calls on the
Minister for Health to reverse the decision to locate the National Children's Hospital at St.
James's Hospital and locate the new Children's Hospital for all the children of Ireland at
Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown.

The Connolly site offers 145 acres, vast space for expansion, easier access for children and
their families and extensive parking. The co-location with Connolly Hospital and the new
Rotunda Maternity Hospital will result in better clinical outcomes. It will be cheaper and
faster to build than on the St. James's site.

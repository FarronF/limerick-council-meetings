The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehy and seconded by Councillor Ryan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Sheehy stated there had been two fatalities on this road

and speed ramps should be installed in the interest of road safety. Members supported the

motion.

**REPLY**:

The road referred to is the LP1161 which links the 5 cross roads in Murroe to the

southern end of the village. The estates of Ross Fearna / The Meadows and Cois

Na Coille have entrances onto the LP1161. Limerick City & County Council

constructed a footpath in 2011 linking these estates to Murroe village.

There have been 2 fatal pedestrian accidents along this road in the past 8

years. Both incidents occurred at approximately the same location 330m from

the 5 cross roads. The speed limit at that location is 50kmph.

The speed limit on this road is 60kmph for a distance of 260m from the 5 cross

roads and 50kmph from there to the village of Murroe.

Over the past few years Limerick City & County Council have carried out the

following;



Placed 2 no. driver feedback signs to slow down the traffic travelling in both

directions.



Additional signage was erected to remind drivers of the speed limit that

exists.

***estates in Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District to have this speed limit of 30km per hour.***

In proposing the motion Councillor Teefy welcomed the inclusion of Ceol na hAbhann in the

speed limit review. The motion was seconded by Councillor Mitchell.

**REPLY:**

With reference to the proposals for the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District

30kmph estates, I confirm that Ceol Na Habhann, Caherconlish is included.

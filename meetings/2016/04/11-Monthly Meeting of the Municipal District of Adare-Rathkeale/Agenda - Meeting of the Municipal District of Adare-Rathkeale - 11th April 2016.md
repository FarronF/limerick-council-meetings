Questions submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will ask at the next Meeting as to why a small business person, who has and needs a
commercial van for their business, is no longer allowed to tax their vehicle at the commercial
rate because they are exempt from doing a VAT return.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor R. O'Donoghue

| will move at the next Meeting, in light of the housing crisis, that an audit is carried out, without
delay, of all Council properties in the Adare-Rathkeale District to identify properties that can be
used to somewhat alleviate the problem. It is clear, having canvassed much of County Limerick
recently, that there are hundreds of vacant properties available to the Council throughout the

County.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council should, as a matter of
urgency, relinquish all rights to protected burial grounds in the Adare-Rathkeale District, as it
appears to be not willing or able to manage and maintain the upkeep of same to a minimum
standard that benefits the owners and the deceased occupiers of these cemeteries.

Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor K. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that this committee would agree to adopt a policy which would
prioritise the issues pertaining to Road Safety such as the putting in place of suitable and
adequate pedestrian crossings, speed ramps, footpaths & lighting. We should be influenced for
the safety of young people using schools and sports facilities and we should be influenced by the
needs of the elderly people at Churches, Doctors Surgeries etc. When we adopt this policy it
should be forwarded to the Engineering Section of Limerick City & County Council and also the
Finance Department of the Council.

| will move at the next Meeting that the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale calls on the
Government and the acting Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner, in view of the
expressed wishes of the people and the misbehaviour of significant numbers of people and the
misbehaviour of significant numbers of people in Askeaton, that Askeaton Garda Station would
be fully staffed at the first available opportunity.

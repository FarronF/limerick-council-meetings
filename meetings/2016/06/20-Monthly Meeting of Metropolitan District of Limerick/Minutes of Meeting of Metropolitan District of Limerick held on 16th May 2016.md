At the outset Members congratulated former Councillor Maria Byrne on her election to the

Seanad. Members noted the commitment Senator Byrne had shown to her constituents, to the

Council and to the various committees she had served on and wished her well in her new role.

Members also extended congratulations to Senator Kieran O’Donnell and Senator Paul Gavan on

their election to the Seanad.

Members noted that despite their previous requests to have planning included on the agenda

for the monthly District Meetings this had not taken place and a motion that planning be

included on the agenda each month was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by

Councillor Daly. Members noted that the public expected Members to have knowledge of

planning activity and for Members to be in a position to raise concerns being expressed by the

public in relation to same. Members also noted the benefits of receiving planning updates on

key projects in the District.

The Meetings Administrator pointed out that there would be legal issues in relation to discussing

individual planning applications at District Meetings and undertook to take appropriate advice

and revert back to the Members. Members also raised the matter of national issues being

discussed at District Meetings when preference should be given to local issues.

The Meetings Administrator suggested that the various groupings in the chamber nominate a

Member to discuss the agenda for the monthly District Meetings and the issues that had been

raised by Members in relation to same.

Members expressed concern at the manner in which major items were presented to the media

in advance of being brought to the attention of the Councillors. As a result, Members noted

they were unable to respond satisfactorily to media queries and called on the Chief Executive to

engage with Councillors on major issues, before they were presented to the media.---

**Disposal of Land**

Circulated, Report of the Director of Service Operations dated 11th May, 2016 setting out

proposals to dispose of 15.98 acres of land at Mungret College, Co. Limerick to the Trustees of

Mungret St. Pauls GAA Club for the proposed consideration of €191,760 and noting that the

proposed disposal of land would be included on the agenda for the May Meeting of the full

Council.

Members welcomed the proposed disposal as set out in the circulated report and noted that this

would facilitate the GAA Club to further develop their sporting facilities to the benefit of their

members, the local community and the region. Members acknowledged the existing

contribution the club made to the locality and the future potential of the club through co-

operation and engagement with schools and other clubs in the area.

Members noted discussions with Dooneen Athletic Club who were proposing to build a running

track on the Mungret site and that the area of land under discussion was not large enough to

develop a full track. Members noted that Dooneen Athletic Club were willing to collaborate with

other clubs, schools and community games towards the development of shared facilities and

requested that the Council assist in this regard.

The Senior Executive Officer, Property informed the Meeting that the transfer of lands to

facilitate the construction of the two new primary schools at Mungret had been finalised and

that a Section 183 Notice would be brought to the May Meeting of the Council seeking approval

for the proposed sale. Members welcomed the proposed disposal as outlined by the Senior

Executive Officer, Property and it was agreed, on the proposal of Councillor Collins and seconded

by Councillor Leddin, that this disposal should proceed to full Council.

**existing plan**

Circulated, Report of the Director of Service, Economic Development and Planning dated 5th

May, 2016 enclosing a copy of the Chief Executive’s Report dated 5th May, 2016 in which the

Chief Executive recommended that the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011 – 2017 be

extended by a further 5 years.

Members noted that the proposed new Limerick to Foynes Road was not mentioned in the plan.

The Senior Executive Planner informed the Meeting that she had raised this issue with the Mid

West Road Design Office who confirmed that the line of the new road did not encroach on the

area covered by the plan.

Members noted the benefits of developing a protected cycleway, via the Baggott Estate, from

Limerick to Mungret and sought an update on the disused rail line to the Cement Factory in

Mungret and noted its potential to be used for light rail or as a cycleway. The Senior Executive

Planner noted that a cycle strategy was in place for the city and that there were no immediate

plans to develop this rail line. Members requested that the Council initiate discussions with

Iarnrod Eireann in relation to the future use of this line and the Senior Executive Planner

undertook to revert to the Members in relation to same.---

In response to queries the Operations Manager, Central Services & North Division noted that

there was no funding available for the development of Park and Ride facilities and Members

stressed the importance of having plans in place and sites identified, should funding become

available in this regard.

Proposed by Councillor Leddin;

Seconded by Councillor McCreesh;

And Resolved:

"That, having considered the Chief Executive's Report dated 5th May 2016, in accordance with

Section 19 (1)(d) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) approval is hereby

given to defer the sending of a Notice under Section 20(3)(a)(i) and defer publishing a Notice

under Section 20(3)(a)(ii) for the Southern Environs Local Area Plan 2011-2017 for a further

period of 5 years".

**Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting that the Council clarify the correct boundary lines that designate***

***the areas named as Ballysimon, Roxborough and Ballinacurra. I have received a number of***

***queries from residents and local businesses who are querying the fact that Council maps are***

***practically stating that the entire South side of the City is called Roxborough.***

**REPLY**:

Ballysimon, Ballysimon Commons, Ballysimon (Dickson), Ballysimon (Staunton),

Ballinacurra

(Bowman),

Ballinacurra

(Hart),

Ballinacurra

(Weston)

and

Roxborough are all townlands adjacent to the city. Further details in relation to

the boundaries of each of these townlands is available at www.townlands.ie

The Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) references

'Roxborough Road' and 'Roxboro roundabout' in its objectives and not Roxboro

as an area/townland. Any Council maps that may be giving rise to confusion in

relation to the naming of locations in the south side of the city should be brought

to our attention and we will review same.

It may be that the location of some premises adjacent to the Roxborough Road

and the Ballysimon Road, both of which pass through a range of townlands, is

giving rise to confusion.

It should be noted that Eircode uses 'Roxboro' in its address for the Maldron

Hotel. Eircode's data sources are from the OSI and An Post Geodirectory in

addition to the Placenames Branch (Department of Arts, Heritage and the

Gaeltacht). It is a matter for the above agencies to rectify any error that may exist

in their databases in relation to 'Roxboro' and south side Limerick City addresses.

**7.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the lands formerly owned by Braddish & Co.***

***located in Ballykeefe and whether the legal transfer of ownership has been completed and if***

***not what is the expected timeframe for concluding this matter.***

**REPLY**:

Discussions are continuing to advance with regard to these lands at Ballykeefe---
5

owned by Braddish and Co.

The Council is taking a proactive position in relation to regularising the position

and securing the optimum outcome for the local authority.

It is intended to bring the engagements to a conclusion during the coming

months.

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, in relation to the old Limerick City Council, from the launch of***

***the scheme in 2011 to the merger of the Councils in 2014, how many people began JobBridge***

***internships for that Council and how many went on to secure full time jobs with the Council***

***afterwards?***

**REPLY:**

44 No. participants commenced Jobbridge Internships with Limerick City Council

from the launch of the scheme in 2011 to the merger of the Councils on 1st June

2014.

2 No. participants went on to secure full time jobs with the Council afterwards.

**9.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will ask at the next Meeting what plans the Council has to revive Nicholas Street and***

***develop it as an historic and cultural centre of Limerick?***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City & County Council is involved in a series of initiatives in the Nicholas

Street area with the ultimate aim to revitalise the area from a residential,

commercial, tourist and cultural point of view. These initiatives include:

 Utilising existing Council property for commercial and community use e.g. the

development of a community park in partnership with the Civic Trust; making

two properties available for the development of a craft hub, etc.

 Working with the Nicholas Traders on issues of mutual interest

 Working with Shannon Heritage to improve the tourism offering around King

Johns Castle e.g. signage, upgrading of existing car park, concerts, etc.

 In discussions to acquire the Convent site

 Facilitating investment in commercial activities - currently there are three live

projects

 Love Your Street scheme to get underway in the summer (agreement with

traders)

 Living Cities initiative extended to Nicholas Street

 Purple Flag application to incorporate Nicholas Street

**10.**

**Question submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many houses in the Metropolitan District have been***

***brought into Council ownership through Mortgage to Rent Schemes for those in mortgage***

***difficulties since the Council merger in 2014?***---
6

**REPLY:**

I wish to advise the Approved Housing Bodies have 4 properties under the

Mortgage to Rent Scheme which were privately owned through financial

institutions and are currently processing additional applications.

Limerick City and County Council currently have no properties in local authority

ownership under the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.

**11.**

**Question submitted by Cmhlr. Séighin Ó Ceallaigh**

***I will ask at the next Meeting how many social houses are planned to be built in the***

***Metropolitan Area of Limerick by the end of 2016 and separately, by the end of 2017?***

**REPLY:**

The number of new-build social housing units scheduled to be completed in the

Metropolitan Area by Limerick City and County Council in 2016 and 2017 is 12

units (Cliona Park Phase 2 and Cliona Park Gap site) and 143 units (Lord Edward

Street, Sheep Street / Athlunkard Street, Churchfield Site Southill Phase 1, Clare

Street and Joseph Street) respectively. The above figures exclude housing units

delivered under the major refurbishment programme (8-10 Gaol Lane, Hassett’s

Villas and Hyde Road Flats).

The number of new-build units to be delivered via Part V is not estimated as this

overall number is dependent on the level of activity in the private construction

sector.

There are 3 main mechanisms to the delivery of social housing units – 1)

Construction, 2) Acquisitions and 3) Leasing.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Gilligan**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council move the statue of Patrick Sarsfield from its***

***present position to a more prominent location in St. Johns Square.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Gilligan and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

In proposing the motion Councillor Gilligan noted that this statue had been located on its

current site 125 years ago on land allocated by the Bishop of Limerick as a temporary site and

was effectively hidden from the view of the general public. He noted that Patrick Sarsfield had

been headquartered in the guard house of St. John’s Hospital and would be best remembered in

St. John’s Square, with the existing fountain moved to the inner square.

Members supporting the motion noted that Patrick Sarsfield was an important part of our

history and his statue should be in a prominent public location accessible by the general public

and by tourists.

Members opposing the motion suggested that the people in the area should be consulted on

whether the statue should be moved or not and noted that the current location of the statue

offered protection from vandalism. A view was also expressed that the railings around the

statue at its current location be recessed to allow access at all hours of the day.---
7

Following discussion it was proposed by Councillor O’Hanlon, seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh

that the 1916 Centenary Committee should also fill the role of a Monuments Committee and

that Councillor Gilligan should be added as a member of this committee. The Meetings

Administrator undertook to revert to the Members at the next Meeting with the names of the

members of this committee. He pointed out however that the 1916 Centenary Committee had

a county wide brief and was set up for a specific purpose. In this regard it may be necessary for

the Metropolitan Committee to instead establish a Special Committee to look at the issue of

statues and monuments etc in its area.

**13.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council enter into negotiations with NAMA with a***

***view to providing a temporary car park on the former John Moloney garage site opposite***

***Punches so as to facilitate a park & ride service and remove another derelict site from the city***

***landscape.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Collins.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin noted that, while planning permission for commercial

development had been granted on this site a number of years previously, there were a number

of derelict buildings on the site that should be removed to facilitate the use of the site as a

temporary car park. In addition, Councillor Leddin pointed out that St. Pauls Primary School

planned to move temporarily to the adjacent Scoil Carmel to facilitate building works and the

availability of a temporary car park as suggested would assist in this regard.

Members supported the motion and noted that parking was already an issue in the locality with

the former Punch’s Hotel being used for student accommodation and Mary Immaculate College

located nearby and requested that the start time for St. Pauls Primary, when it relocates, should

be staggered with other schools nearby.

The Director pointed out that Punches Cross was already a busy location and that park and ride

facilities would be better located further out from the City Centre. He undertook however to

review the matter based on the proposed temporary relocation of St. Pauls Primary School.

The Operations Manager undertook to work with St. Pauls Primary School and also to discuss

the future use of the site under discussion with the Economic Development Directorate and

revert to the Members at the next Operational Briefings.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Joe Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting that approved housing bodies be invited to present their***

***suggestions and plans to the Elected Members of the District as to how we can fast track the***

***development of 23 sites identified as suitable for housing and in Council ownership.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor McCreesh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Leddin noted the slow lead in time to developing sites for

housing and pointed out that a number of the sites in question may be eligible for the fast track

process. In seconding the motion Councillor McCreesh noted that the motion was appropriate---
8

given the numbers on the housing list and the relatively small number of houses to be delivered

by the Council by the end of 2017.

**REPLY:**

The policy document ‘Assessment for Selecting Sites for Social Housing’ (ASH)

identified 23 sites in Limerick City within the ownership of Limerick City and

County Council which passed the Stage A ‘Strategic Constraints’ filter.

Limerick City and County Council are currently engaging with the Irish Council for

Social Housing (ICSH) regarding the potential involvement of Approved Housing

Bodies (AHBs) with appropriate capacity to advance the delivery of social

housing. When specific proposals are developed, engagement with the elected

members will take place.

In response to queries from the Members the Senior Executive Architect clarified the following :

 There were approximately 500 Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) in the state. The Council

was looking at streamlining the housing delivery process and working with AHBs that could

deliver housing units.

 The devolved process involved a single stage approval process compared to four stages in

the normal process. Costings for the single stage process had to be robust as any

subsequent cost increases would have to be carried by the Council. Because of the potential

for unforseen costs in infill projects there was a reluctance to use the single stage process.

 Tenders for the Hyde Road redevelopment were expected back in the immediate future and

Members would be kept updated in relation to same.

 There were 736 units currently in the process, in conjunction with AHBs.

 In relation to Kilmurry Court, site clearance was underway. It was envisioned that this

development would facilitate people to downsize to more suitable accommodation, freeing

up bigger houses and also provide access to the adjacent graveyard.

 The proposed development at Doonbeg, Rhebogue had not gone to planning.

Members sought more regular updates on progress in delivering social housing. The Senior

Executive Architect noted that a recent presentation to the Home and Social Strategic Policy

Committee in this regard could be circulated to District Members.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick Metropolitan District write to the EPA asking for***

***them to resume monitoring air quality in Limerick City.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that air monitoring was in place in Limerick

City up to 2011 and would be of benefit now to monitor the benefits of Smarter Travel

initiatives and in light of the potential for new fuels to be used at the Cement Factory, Mungret.

**REPLY:**

The EPA divides the county into four zones (A, B, C & D) for the purposes of air

quality monitoring. Zones A & B relate to Dublin and Cork respectively and both

of these areas have permanent air quality monitoring stations. Limerick is a Zone---
9

C (towns with populations greater than 15,000). Zone D relates to smaller towns

and rural areas.

Present EPA policy is to use mobile assessment units in Zones C & D which are left

in place for approximately 12 months. Limerick was last assessed by this unit in

2000. At the time air quality was good for all parameters with the exception of

PM10, which was above the upper threshold value.

There was a permanent station monitoring for NOx and Ozone at the Park Road

Depot. However this was removed in 2011 because of access difficulties.

Currently the EPA are developing a National Ambient Air Monitoring Programme.

This will allow for doubling of the monitoring network and is likely to include re-

establishing a monitoring station in Limerick. However, it is likely to be 2017 to

2018 before this is in place.

Consideration can also be given to the installations of a number of real time

monitoring stations for particulates in the City. All these matters can be

examined further.

Members supported the motion and indicated that, with the ban on smokey coal in the city, air

quality had apparently improved and stressed that it was important to monitor air quality and

be aware of the facts in relation to same.

**16.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Cian Prendiville**

***I will move at the next Meeting that, given the particularly high levels of suicide and mental***

***health difficulties in the Metropolitan District, we write to the incoming Minister for Health***

***and Minister for Finance urging them to reverse plans to take €12m from the mental health***

***services budget.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Prendiville and seconded by Councillor Keller.

In proposing the motion Councillor Prendiville noted that the recent Darkness into Light

marches had shown the level of public concern and support for this issue. He stressed the need

for increased Government spending in this area and for discussions to commence on

interventions that needed to be provided.

Members supported the motion and made the following points during discussions on same :

 Increased support should be given to programmes that improve mental health and to the

voluntary organisations that work in the area of suicide prevention.

 Many homeless people were in need of support for mental health issues.

 Many young people leaving the education system were facing mental health issues with

increased stress due to the challenges of securing employment and accommodation.

 A programme should be put in place in primary schools using role models to convey the

message that “it’s okay not to feel okay” and the Minister for Education should be written to

in this regard.

On the proposal of Cmhlr. Ó Ceallaigh, seconded by Councillor Sheahan, it was agreed that

Standing Orders would be suspended to allow for the completion of the agenda.---
10

**17.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Paul Keller**

***I will move at the next Meeting that, given the importance of transparency to so many people***

***in the Metropolitan District, this District calls on the Government to introduce legislation to***

***require all debt write down's and write off's by NAMA be approved in the Dail.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keller and seconded by Councillor Prendiville.

In proposing the motion Councillor Keller noted issues raised in the media regarding low cost

sales and lack of transparency by NAMA and indicated that there was an increased public

perception that NAMA had carried out transactions that were not in the best interest of the tax

payer.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Daniel Butler**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council appoint a dedicated European Officer whose***

***function it would be to identify programmes that could be authorised or monies drawn down***

***for Council activities.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

In proposing the motion Councillor Butler noted the potential of Europe as a source of broad

based funding and the need for specialised skills and expertise to tap into same. He noted the

importance of this role as Limerick competed as a European city to attract high skilled labour

and companies.

**REPLY:**

The Economic Development Directorate has responsibility for European Projects

and there is an established expertise within the directorate for EU projects.

To date the team has managed 3 projects to conclusion that were transferred

from the Mid-West Regional Authority.

The team

 was successful in securing €4.2 million in ERDF funding to improve the public

realm on O’Connell Street

 is participating in an URBACT network that will investigate the potential of

developing the digital economy to support economic development

 has prepared and submitted an application under the Urban Innovative

Actions initiative (€5mil)

 is preparing an application for funding to support “smart aging”

It is anticipated that in the course of 2016 that a further 2 applications will be

made for funding.

Members noted that, while the staff that had transferred from the Mid West Regional Authority

had expertise in this area, they also had other duties to carry out. They noted the potential of

Europe as a source of funding and that the Council was not making the most of this opportunity.

Members requested that the Economic Development Directorate attend at a future Meeting to

discuss existing projects and proposals going forward in this regard.---
11

**19.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor John Costelloe**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Council consider the purchase of vacant houses at St.***

***Ann's Court (off Bishops Street), King's Island, currently owned by Saint Vincent DePaul (SVP)***

***and that the amount of*** ***€1,984,600 allocated*** ***to Shelbourne Square, North Circular Road be***

***reallocated to facilitate this purchase.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Costelloe and seconded by Councillor Gilligan.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) are currently in discussions with the

Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government regarding a replacement

project for the Shelbourne Square, North Circular Road project. This replacement

project will require a similar level of funding to that connected to the Shelbourne

Square scheme.

St. Ann’s Court is not within the ownership of LCCC. LCCC will engage with the

owners with a view to establishing their future intentions for this site.

Members noted that an undertaking had not been given to purchase these houses and the

Meetings Administrator undertook to clarify the Council’s intentions in relation to St. Anne’s

Court and revert to the Members.

**20.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Malachy McCreesh**

***I will move at the next Meeting that this District seeks clarification from Planning and***

***Environmental Services as to what public consultation process will be included in the decision***

***regarding the revised planning application lodged by Irish Cement seeking permission to***

***gradually replace imported fossil fuels at its Castlemungret factory.***

In proposing the motion Councillor McCreesh noted that people living near the Cement Factory

were seeking an independent assessment of Irish Cement’s plans for the plant and details of

what controls would be in place in relation to any accidental discharges from the plant.

Members supported the motion and noted that the proposed development included both a

planning application and a licence application to the EPA and that local residents were anxious

to establish how they could participate in both processes and at what level decisions would be

made in relation to these applications.

Members noted that this issue had been raised at a recent Meeting of the full Council where

Members had sought a briefing from Management on the role of the Members and the public in

these processes.

**REPLY:**

The planning application by Irish Cement was lodged with Limerick City and

County Council on the 27th April 2016. Site notices were erected at the site and a

newspaper advert was placed in the Irish Independent newspaper. Submissions

from the general public can be received by the planning authority for a 5 week

period up until the 31st May 2016. The planning application is due for decision on

the 21st June 2016. The planning file can be viewed on Limerick City and County

Council website or at the front desk in Planning and Environmental Services

Department in County Hall, Dooradoyle.---

The Director, Physical Development undertook to address the information request made by the

Members.

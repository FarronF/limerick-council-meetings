**Item 4.**

**To Note the New Directorate Structure**

Pat Daly stated that under the new corporate structure two directorates will support

the core work of the SPC i.e. Economic Development and Service Operations. He

stated that Forward Planning now resides in the Economic directorate and Planning

Management/Enforcement etc resides in the Service Operations directorate.

There was some discussion regarding the role of the committee and Council

meetings in general. It was felt that the SPC needs to move to a more strategic

level. The SPC should take the lead in advancing policies and practices that will

ensure that the Council is ‘ahead of the game'. Mention was made of a master

planning exercise for the Cleeves site. The meeting agendas should reflect this

approach. It was also suggested that the SPC would receive presentations from

outside agencies when appropriate.

She noted that St. Joseph’s Boys National School operated a Junior School Warden Scheme and
that, while the school were eager to continue with same, the safety of the children had to be
taken into consideration. In response to an enquiry from Members, Ms McMahon noted that 40%
to 50% of pupils were dropped off at the school by car with this figure increasing in wet weather.

The Members indicated their agreement with the points raised by the deputation and made the
following points while discussing same.

e That this issue had been ongoing for some time and that similar issues were in place in
many other schools. It was suggested that a list of all such issues be drawn up and a plan-—
put in place to address same.

e There was an onus on parents to park safely when dropping off and collecting children
from school and the school should write to parents in relation to same. Ms. McMahon
noted that, while parents had been written to in this regard as part of the enrolment
process, dismissal time was still an issue, with parents arriving at the same time and she
undertook to write to parents again on this matter.

@ Many schools had been allowed to expand without issues in relation to traffic calming, set
down areas, pedestrian crossings and the general safety of pupils arriving at and departing
from the school being addressed.

On the proposal of Councillor McMahon, seconded by Councillor Keary it was agreed that the
District would write to the Minister for Education and Skills requesting funding for a range of road
safety measures required, in association with the schools in the District.

The Operations Manager, South and West Division, indicated that €35,000 had been allocated to
the installation of a pedestrian crossing at Newline Road and noted that a raised crossing would
cost an additional €4,000 to €5,000. Following discussion Members agreed that the allocation of
€11,000 for ‘Rathkeale Footpaths’ in the Development Fund would be used to provide two ramps

on Thomas Street.

Director, Regional Services stressed that the Council would do its best to deliver a solution, within
its remit, and noted that the Gardai also had a role to play in monitoring and prosecuting any
breaches of the law.

3. Corporate Services

4. Community Support Services

Mr. D. Hennessy, Administrative Officer, Community Support Services outlined details of the
Tenant Purchase Scheme 2016 and undertook to circulate the Members with a copy of same.

In response to queries from Members, Mr. Hennessy clarified the following:-

e Any decision in relation to antisocial behaviour would be based on convictions rather than
hearsay.
Tenants with no income other than social welfare would not qualify.
Any works carried out to a property by the tenants would be assessed by an Raispendane
valuer and in cases of disagreement would be sent to an appeals process.

e Clarification would be sought from the Department as to whether tenants, who would not
normally qualify under the terms of the scheme but had cash amounts that would enable
them to purchase the house, would qualify.

Members noted that there were vacant houses in NAMA estates within the District. The Director,
Regional Services indicated that any such property should be brought to the attention of Pat
Dowling, Director of Home and Community.

5. Planning & Environmental Services
(a) To receive update on Harte’s Thatched House, Coolrahnee, Askeaton, Co.

Limerick.

The Conservation Officer noted that, while a valuation had been received from the purported
owner in relation to this property, a valuer appointed by the Council had put a lower value on
same. Correspondence with the purported owner had not been returned and efforts were

ongoing to renew contacts.

It was noted by Members that this property was now effectively a derelict site and suggested that
the Council should take possession of same and liaise with the local Men’s Shed Group who had
indicated an interest in taking on the restoration of the property as a project.

At the request of Members the Conservation Officer gave an update on the restoration of the two
cottages in Adare damaged by fire and noted that works were to commence within the coming

weeks.

A discussion took place in relation to the sourcing of reed that might be used to restore these
cottages. It was noted that reed was being imported from Poland, Turkey and China, with claims
that this reed was more durable than local reed. Members indicated that, while it would be unfair
to be unduly restrictive in this regard, they would support the use of local reed where possible.

Members noted that invoices in relation to the Fire Brigade charges associated with attending at
this fire had been issued and a request was made that these charges be struck off in any instances
where the property owner had been unable to obtain affordable fire insurance.

The Director, Regional Services noted that a certain level of receipts were included in the budget
under this heading but undertook to consider the request and revert to the Members in relation

to same.

Members raised issues in relation to materials to be used in this project, fire insurance and the
application of fire regulations to the project. The Conservation Officer noted that it was a matter
for the consultants, employed by the property owners, to ensure the design allowed for fire
prevention and the prevention of fire spread and that the Dorset Protocol would be employed in

this regard.

Members requested that Item Nos. 5(b), 5(c), 5(d); Item 6 and Item No. 13 be dealt with at the

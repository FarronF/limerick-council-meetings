ion submitted ncillor J. Scanlan

| will ask at the next Meeting when an effective waste water disposal arrangement will be
provided for Hillside Estate, Dromcollogher.

Limerick City and County Council, on behalf of Irish Water, are currently surveying the
Hillside Estate. The tendering process will commence as soon as surveying and documents
are complete. it is anticipated that works will commence within 3 months.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan
1 will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the provision of directional signage at Hillside
Drive, Athea.

This signage is being erected.

Members raised concerns that notification that the sign had been erected was not conveyed to
them. They noted there was still an issue with the naming of Hillside Drive on the directional sign
and queried if Gortnagross could be added. The Operations Manager agreed to look at the
signage again and revert to the next Meeting.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

1 will ask at the next Meeting if a waste bin service can be provided at Holy Cross Cemetery
Athea.

REPLY: A bin service was provided to the above mentioned cemetery however the service had

to be removed due to misuse. Currently a number of TUS workers are carrying out clean
ups in both of the cemeteries in Athea and this is working well.

The Council provides a bin collection service to 11 cemeteries within the Newcastle West
Municipal District in 2016 and this would have been budgeted for in this year's budget.
Therefore the funding available for 2016 does not allow for the addition of any further
bin collections for cemeteries. The matter can be revisited for 2017 should funding allow.

Members stressed the need for a bin service at this location and noted that any misuse of such
service should be dealt with and the bin left in place. The Operations Manager undertook to

review this request.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

1 will move at the next Meeting that a street cleaning programme be put in place for the
village of Mountcollins.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Galvin stated that the street sweeper should be
available for smail villages on a regular basis.

Councillor Foley seconded the Motion.

The Newcastle West Municipal District currently has access to the road sweeper for 1 day
every second week and this is rotated between the towns of Newcastle West and
Abbeyfeale. Given the limited availability of the sweeper, the Council can only commit to

sweeping Mountcollins on a six monthly basis, should resources allow.

Members suggested that mini road sweepers should be employed in the smaller towns and
villages.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanian

10.
1 will move at the next Meeting that the direction towards Monagea be incorporated on
signage at the junction with the L 1315 at Boherbui, Newcastle West.

possible. =

11. Notice of Motion sub: incillor J. Scant.
1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council put an immediate
annual plan in place for grass cutting and general maintenance at the Glebe Estate in
Monagea.
In proposing the Motion Councillor Scanlan stated that he understood that the Bond had been
realised and further works had been carried out to finish the estate. He stated that it was now
imperative that this estate be taken in charge.
Councillor Collins seconded the Motion.

REPLY: The Glebe Estate in Monagea has not been taken in charge by Limerick City and County
Council. We have looked at the estate and there are significant elements of landscaping
works to be carried out as well as grass cutting. These should be completed and the
estate taken in charge before the Parks and Landscaping team become responsible for
grass cutting.

12. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin
1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council take over the running
costs of lighting the Grotto in Mountcollins.
Councillor Galvin in proposing the Motion stated that we should try to assist in this matter.
Councillor Collins seconded the Motion.
REPLY: The Council's budget for energy/maintenance of the public lighting system has been

significantly reduced in recent years. Accordingly it is not possible to add any additional
lights to the Council's system at this time and for the foreseeable future other than those
governed by planning commitments. However, the Director of Services for the Municipal
District has received a request to meet Mountcollins Development Association and this
matter can be discussed further at that time.

Members noted that there were grottos elsewhere with similar requirements.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Foley

1 will move at the next Meeting that funding be sought immediately for the upgrading of the
road surface from Mountmahon to the Garda Station in Abbeyfeale as the surface is in a
dangerous condition.

Councillor Foley in proposing the Motion stated that the road had detiorated considerably and
that the Council should immediately seek funding from the Til. Members asked that this matter
be pursued and an update given at the next Meeting.

PLy:

funding and the above mentioned roadway forms part of this submission.
N f M i ncillor S. Brown:

! will move at the next Meeting that hedges at St. Joseph's housing estate, Dromcollogher be
trimmed back.

Councillor Browne in proposing the Motion stated that this was a Council estate and that, due to
overhanging hedges, children in the estate were unable to play in the Green area.

Councillor Scanlan seconded the Motion.

In the West Division, hedges at Regional road junctions are cut annually along with local
roads which are high risk. Hedge cutting also takes place around signs at junctions. The
Roads Act 1993 obliges landowners and occupiers of land to take all reasonable care to
ensure that trees, ditches, hedges and other vegetation growing on their land are not
our could not become a danger to people using or working on a public road.

The Wildlife Act 1976 prohibits hedge cutting between the 1* March and 31” August
each year and therefore the above mentioned hedges at St. Joseph’s housing estate
cannot be cut at the present time however consideration will be given to trimming these
back once the prohibition period for hedge cutting has concluded.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

1 will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council set aside money from
the Development Contribution Fund to design and undertake full overlay of pavement in the

town of Glin.

Councillor Sheahan in proposing the Motion stated that, as a result of works carried out by Irish
Water,the street and pavements in Glin were in poor condition and asked that the Council
consider re surfacing the entire road.

Councillor Collins seconded the Motion.

REPLY: Prior to carrying out a major overlay of the carriageway in Glin Village, it would be

prudent to undertake a strategic Public Realm Plan for the village. This plan would
inform the design of the layout of the footpaths and carriageway for the future. The
design of any infrastructural improvements could be carried out at that stage subject to
the necessary funds being available. A submission in this regard will be made to the
Development Fund shortly.

Members requested that any study should be done in consultation with local residents and the
results of same should be brought to a future Meeting of the District.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

1 will move at the next Meeting that a pedestrian crossing be provided at a location in South
Main Street, Glin.

Councillor Sheahan in proposing the Motion stated that the relocation of the Post Office to
South Main Street had given rise to increased pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the street
resulting in two near accidents in recent times and that a pedestrian crossing was required to
improve safety for pedestrians.

Councillor Browne seconded the Motion.

REPLY: In Glin the road surface is in need of upgrade over much of its length and the village

could do with a formal pavement renewal plan to incorporate public realm
improvements — in effect a redesign of the village road scape. The street widths in Glin
are particularly broad which can make the crossing of the road more difficult. However a
crossing would ideally be carried out in conjunction with a village design in order to
achieve the best solution.

The Operations Manager noted that a pedestrian crossing costs in the region of €35,000. There
were many requests for crossings throughout the District, with a crossing in Bruree being funded
under the General Municipal Allocation.

At the conclusion of the Agenda the following items were discussed with the consent of the
Cathaoirleach.

Councillor Sheahan requested an explanation as to why fencing was put in place at the Limerick
City and County Council Depot in Glin. The Operations Manager noted that, as a result of risk
assessments carried out on all depots in the County, it was recommended by the Health and
Safety Officer that the erection of fencing was necessary for safety and security reasons.

Councillor Collins raised a matter which had been previously discussed at a Meeting of the
District in relation to the renaming of The Square, Newcastle West to Con Colbert Square. The
Operations Manager noted that following research, it appeared that this matter was originally
proposed in 1966 but never came to fruition. Members were in agreement that the process
should now be undertaken to rename The Square, Newcastle West.

It was agreed to hold the June Meeting on Wednesday, 1" June, 2016.

This concluded the Meeting.

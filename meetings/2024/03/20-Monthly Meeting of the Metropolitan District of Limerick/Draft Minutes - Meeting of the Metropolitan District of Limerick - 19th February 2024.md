***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress is being made***

***on the development of a new children's playground in Dooradoyle, following agreement at the***

***recent Community, Leisure and Culture Strategic Policy Committee.***

**REPLY**:

1. There are currently two public playgrounds available in Dooradoyle, a small playground located

at the Crescent Shopping Centre and a large playground at Mungret Park. The Council has been

asked to look at the development of a new playground and staff have carried out a high-level

review of the existing green spaces in the Dooradoyle area. There is limited green space

available that could be considered for a public playground. The green space that is available is

largely open green space within existing housing developments. In order to progress this matter

further, the Council will need to determine the extent of the play facility that is required for the

Dooradoyle area and how the existing greenspace can meet the required demand.

2. Once the size, location and cost of the proposed playground is agreed, the Council will examine

how it will be financed and will progress agreed proposals to Part 8 and inclusion in the Capital

Works Programme.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how much revenue has***

***been collected and how many fines issued for dog fouling in 2022 and 2023.***

**REPLY**:

**2022**

**2023**

5 Dog Fouling fines issued

3 Dog Fouling fines Issued

Revenue Collected €600.00

Revenue Collected €0.00

1 Court proceedings have been

initiated

2 Withdrawn

Under Section 22 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 it is an offence to allow a dog under your control

to foul a public place. A Litter/ Dog Warden can issue a fixed penalty fine for dog fouling under the

Act, however the burden of proof is high. Prosecutions can be difficult as the Litter or Dog Warden

must witness the incident and the dog must be connected to a person at the time of the offense.

Where member of the public reports an instance they must be willing to give evidence in court,

however many are reluctant to do so.

A new awareness campaign will be launched in Q2 2024 to raise awareness about dog owners’

responsibilities to clear up after their pets.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what steps, if any, have***

***permission, and what steps will be taken to address this issue, given that no operational creche***

***has been provided under any of those permissions to-date.***
---

**REPLY**: The responsibility to ensure that planning permissions, including the attached conditions,

are complied with and implemented in accordance with the permission, rests with the

initiates investigation in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and

Development Act 2000 (as amended).

assessment of funding needs with regard to installation and operational costs, taking in to

account grant funding that may be available from The Department of Justice. Every effort

will be made to source the necessary funding for a CCTV scheme in Garryowen.

proportionality and justification may fail at any stage.

Limerick City & County Council will endeavour to carefully and meticulously support the

process, engaging with An Garda Síochána, Elected Members and the Public.

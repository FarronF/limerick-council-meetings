QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the agenda were circulated to all Members prior to the

Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

7.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for information on where all air quality monitors in Limerick**

**city and county are located and recent data for same and to ask for an update on an air**

**quality strategy for Limerick.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) owns three indicative air quality monitors in

operation in Limerick City and Environs that provide data to the public. The monitors

are located in Castletroy, Mungret and O’Connell Street. Real-time data from the

monitors is accessible at www.airqweb.com (link available on the Council’s website

Air Quality | Limerick.ie). A monthly report on air quality from the three monitors is

provided on the Council’s website. The data from the monitors is also available on the

Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) website www.airquality.ie.

The EPA also owns monitors within Limerick as listed:

· an indicative air quality monitor at Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick;

· two reference monitors at Henry Street and the People’s Park in Limerick City;

· a reference monitor in Askeaton, Co. Limerick.

Real-time data from these monitors, including national short-term air quality

forecasts, are available at www.airquality.ie. In November 2023, the Council

installed six further indicative air quality monitors, funded by Active Travel, to

support their programme of works (Ballycummin Road, Park Canal, Childers

Road, Old Cratloe Road, Parkway, South Circular Road). It is envisaged that

real-time data for the public will be available in Q1 2024.

The Council also undertakes nitrogen dioxide (NO2) diffusion tube monitoring

(to review traffic-related pollution) at eighteen locations in the City and

Environs where Active Travel Schemes are yet to be constructed (Ballycummin

Road, Belfield Gardens, Childers Road (two locations), Corbally Road,

Dooradoyle Road, Ennis Road (two locations), Father Russell Road, High Street

(near the Milk Market), Mill Road, Old Cratloe Road, Plassey Park Road, the

R510 between Quinn’s Cross and the Raheen Roundabout, recently installed
---

at Roden Street (Outside An Mhodhscoil), recently installed at Scoil Mháthair

Dé on the South Circular Road, recently installed at Brookville Avenue).

The Council’s statutory requirement in relation to air quality is to enforce the Air

Pollution Act (1987) and relevant regulations. The Council also:

· undertakes real-time monitoring to provide air quality data to the public;

· supports relevant Council projects (e.g. Active Travel, GoGreenRoutes);

· supports the EPA Ambient Air Monitoring Programme.

The air quality in Limerick is generally good and meets EU norms. The most significant

air pollutants in Limerick and Ireland are particulate matter and NO2. The main source

of these air pollutants is expected to be from the domestic burning of solid fuel and

transportation. There are measures being implemented at a national and regional

level that will potentially have a positive impact on air quality in Limerick, including

the Solid Fuel Regulations 2022 and the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area

Transport Strategy.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

**I will move at the next Meeting that consideration be given for the provision of**

**columbarium structures in Council-owned burial grounds.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor Butler.

Members noted the increase in cremations, rather than traditional burials, in recent years

and they agreed the importance of providing columbarium structures in burial grounds and

cemeteries to respond to this increasing demand, and having regard to land availability and

the difficulties in extending graveyards, etc.

The Council is considering columbarium walls for a number of cemeteries. The

Council has prepared preliminary designs for columbarium gardens for

Kilmurry burial ground and Mount Saint Lawrence burial ground in the

Metropolitan District. Both of these projects will be progressed further this

year. The Council is also considering columbarium walls in cemeteries where

there is limited capacity for burials. In this regard, the Council intends to

provide a columbarium wall in Adare burial ground this year. The provision of

columbarium walls is very much demand-led and is being reviewed on an

annual basis.

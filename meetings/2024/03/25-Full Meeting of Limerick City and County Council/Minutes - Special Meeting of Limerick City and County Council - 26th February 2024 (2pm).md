The Director of Planning, Environment and Place-Making, advised the Members that this meeting

was called to consider the proposed Material Alterations of the Draft Patrickswell Local Area Plan

2024-2030 and the report of the Chief Executive dated 31st January, 2024, on the submissions

received on the Material Alterations to the Draft Patrickswell Local Area Plan, and decide whether

the Local Area Plan shall be made or amended in accordance with Section 20(3)(n) of the Planning

and Development Act, 2000 (as amended). He highlighted the process to date and outlined that

Patrickswell village straddles two different Municipal Districts, therefore, it must be brought to Full

Council for consideration, and pointed out that if approved today it would come into effect in six

weeks.

The following amendment was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne and seconded by Councillor

O’Hanlon.

**Amendment:** The Development Boundary of the Draft Patrickswell Local Area Plan be extended to

incorporate lands (0.42 Hectares) as shown on the accompanying map at Ballyanrahan East,

Patrickswell. Co. Limerick. The subject lands which are located within 600m of the village core, in a

reduced speed zone and served by a public footpath and public lighting are to be zoned ‘Residential

Serviced Sites’ and will accommodate 2 – 4 dwellings over the life of the plan.

**Reason:** There are no ‘new’ lands identified in the Draft LAP for serviced sites in the village and where

it is a policy objective of the Local Authority in the CDP that lands are to be made available in

settlements to counter the proliferation of ‘one off’ houses. In addition, the existing ‘serviced sites’

lands to the east of the village (which benefits from a grant of permission) are located in close

proximity to the motorway, remote from the village and without pedestrian infrastructure.

Members sought clarification on various aspects of the proposed amendment to the Draft

Patrickswell Local Area Plan, and what the process was if the proposed amendment was

passed. Senior Planner, Forward Planning, responded to the Members queries and advised that the

subject site was proposed for inclusion by the Elected Members following consideration of the Draft

Plan and subsequently formed part of the Material Alterations. The OPR on consideration of the

Material Alterations recommended that the site should not be included as they considered it does

not represent compact sequential development, lack of services and there is already sufficient zoned

land to serve the proposed population growth. She further advised if the Members adopted the plan

with the proposed amendment, Forward Planning would revert back to the OPR, who may then

make a recommendation to the Minister.

It was the view of some Members, that the plan should be made in accordance with the proposed

Material Alterations of the Draft Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2024-2030 and the report of the Chief

Executive dated 31st January, 2024, on the submissions received on the Material Alterations to the

Draft Patrickswell Local Area Plan.

With the permission of the Mayor and on the proposal of Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor

O’Hanlon, it was agreed to adjourn for 5 minutes.

On resumption, and following discussions, Members called on the Executive to define what a

beneficial interest is, in relation to the proposal brought before them. In response, Director of

Planning, Environment and Place-Making, highlighted that the decision to make a declaration of

pecuniary or beneficial interest in accordance with Part 7 (Sections 147 to 150) of Planning and

Development Act, 2000 and Part 15 (Section 177) of the Local Government Act, 2001 (as amended),

lies with each individual Member and that he could not advise any Member to make a declaration of

interest.

At the request of the Members, the Director of Planning, Environment and Place-Making referred to

the following sections of Part 7 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, (Disclosures of Interests,

etc.)

147. Declaration by members, etc. of certain interests;

148. Requirements affecting members, etc. who have certain beneficial interests;

149. Supplemental provisions relating to sections 147 and 148;

150. Codes of conduct.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), and seconded by Councillor Kiely it was proposed to defer

the meeting to a later date.

The Mayor then directed that a vote be taken on the proposal to defer the meeting to a later date,

and the result of the vote was as follows:

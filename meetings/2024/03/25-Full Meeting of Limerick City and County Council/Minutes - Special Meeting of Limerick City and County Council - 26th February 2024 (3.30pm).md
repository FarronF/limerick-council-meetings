In proposing the motion, Councillor Keary thanked the Mayor for agreeing to call this special

meeting to discuss the Active Travel Allocations for 2024. He expressed concerns that the allocation

was not a balanced and fair schedule, and asked for Members concerns to be addressed.

He referred to the amount of funding that is allocated to the City schemes, and he emphasised the

importance to have a more balanced approach to spending. He stated that he believed there was a

need to assign more funding to rural areas of Limerick, to increase safety and give those living in

County Limerick an opportunity to walk and cycle to school and work.

Members welcomed the Motion and the discussion on the 2024 allocation for Active Travel

schemes. It was the view of some Members that the allocation was more favourable to Limerick

City, while others pointed out that a lot of money was allocated to rural areas, in particular, the

Limerick Greenway and they felt the allocation was fair and appropriate.---
During discussions, Members called on the Director for Transportation and Mobility to give an

update on the various funding received for Active Travel schemes in Limerick City and County, and

requested that he replied to their concerns in relation to the inappropriate balance in spend

between the City and County.

The Director of Transportation and Mobility acknowledged the views of the Members and their

concerns about the amount of funding allocated to City schemes. He confirmed the amount of

funding received from Department of Transport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and National

Transport Authority, but advised that this funding must be spent in accordance with what it is

approved for. The Director confirmed that Limerick City and County Council did apply for more

funding but unfortunately, did not receive enough.

In response to Members questions on funding for Safe Routes to Schools Schemes, the Director

acknowledged it is an excellent scheme and outlined that in Limerick the Department of Education

made 200 applications for this scheme, but only 9 were approved in tranche one, with a further 5

approved in tranche two. The Director further outlined that Limerick City and County Council do not

have a say in this NTA fund, and cannot determine where it is spent.

The Elected Members queried if Active Travel funding could be used to upgrade and install new

footpaths in rural areas. In response to their queries, the Director for Transportation and Mobility

pointed out that they cannot use the funding for footpaths and suggested, if Members were in

agreement, that they write to the Minister for Transport, Mr. Eamon Ryan, requesting more funding

for rural areas in Limerick.

The Members thanked the Director, and the A/Senior Engineer, Active Travel, for their update and

agreed that Limerick City and County Council should write to the Minister for Transport, Mr. Eamon

Ryan, requesting more funding for rural areas in Limerick. It was also agreed that we should request

additional funding for the maintenance and upkeep of our Active Travel Schemes that have been

completed.

This concluded the meeting.

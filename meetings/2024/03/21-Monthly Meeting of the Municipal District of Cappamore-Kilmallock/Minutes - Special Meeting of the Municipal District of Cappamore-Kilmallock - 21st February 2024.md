The Acting Senior Engineer with Active Travel was welcomed to the meeting by the

Cathaoirleach and the Elected Members wished to acknowledge the funding allocated to

the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District in previous years.

2. Active Travel/NTA allocation of funding 2024.

The Elected Members queried the distribution of funding through Active Travel/NTA 2024

between the urban and rural areas.

It was noted that the total allocation to Limerick City and County Council had been reduced

from 2023.

The need for an improvement in footpaths in the rural areas of Limerick as a safety issue

was highlighted, in particular since the increase in walking post covid.

It was confirmed by the Acting Senior Engineer that the majority of projects to be funded by

Active Travel/NTA in 2024 will be large scale capital projects which fall under the strategy to

build connectivity for schools and communities in the city centre.

It was also confirmed that the Active Travel unit would continue to source additional

funding from the NTA once the large scale projects are completed, for additional schemes

that are shovel ready
---
The installation of Bus stops was acknowledged, and it was noted that applications from

across Limerick are to be submitted to the NTA under the Pedestrian Crossings scheme.

The Senior Executive Engineer confirmed that an update of the Schedule of Municipal

District Works will be delivered to the Elected Members at the March Municipal District

Meeting.

The Cathaoirleach thanked everyone for attending and closed the meeting.

of safety regarding buses stopping here was highlighted. The Senior Executive Engineer and

Director of Services confirmed that Holycross is not an official bus stop according to the

National Transport Association and Active Travel are working with the NTA to highlight the

need for a bus stop at this location. The Active Travel works undertaken at Holycross were

acknowledged and this was recognised at the LAMA awards.

The issue of safety due to speed on the R513 south of Ballylanders was also brought to the

Clarification was provided that the refusal was based on the current guidelines for setting of

speed limits, but that legislation is being reviewed this year.

by An Garda Siochana was raised, and it was agreed that this would be brought to the next

NOTICES OF MOTION DEFERRED FROM JANUARY

MEETING

8.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that

Limerick City and County Council seek to purchase land with a view to making serviced

sites available to potential first time buyers in the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal

District to showcase the future housing potential of this type of development as an

NOTICES OF MOTION

9.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that this

local authority allow stones to be spread on the floor, a seating bench, an information board

and consider allowing public access to St. Andrews Medieval Church at Kilfinane Graveyard”

**REPLY**

It was always the Councils intention to allow public access to St Andrew’s Medieval Church

in Kilfinnane Graveyard. The seating and information board are included on proposed plans

for opening up the Church to the public. There is currently architectural stone stored inside

the Church and discussions are occurring with the Department and National Monuments to

agree its long term storage. Once the storage of the architectural stone is resolved, it is

intended to place the seating along the north wall to avail of maximum sunshine in the

Church ruin. In relation to the surfacing, the Department are not in favour of a gravel

surface. It is considered that grass/sod is a more appropriate and environmentally

acceptable material for the interior surface of the Church.

10.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Teefy

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that a

pedestrian crossing be put in at Holycross on the R512 where there is very large movement

of traffic and pedestrians.”

**REPLY**

The current speed limit on the R512 at Holycross is 80kph. This makes the location

unsuitable for the installation of a pedestrian crossing at present. However, as part of the

2023 Speed Limits Appeals process, there is a proposal to reduce the speed limit at

Holycross to 60kph. This proposal will be advertised for consultation shortly. If there are no

objections or submissions, this speed limit revision will be incorporated into revised draft

speed limit bye-laws for Limerick and brought forward to full council for consideration and

approval. If the proposed reduced speed limit is adopted, the Municipal District office will

assess the pedestrian crossing movements and if warranted, a design will prepared and a

funding submission made to the relevant funding authority.

11.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors Donegan

“I will move at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock that

Limerick City & County Council install traffic calming measures, appropriate signage and a

speed limit extension on the west side approach road into Bruree village on the R518.”

**REPLY**

The Municipal District office will assess current traffic speeds on the R518 at the location

identified. If it is determined that traffic is exceeding the speed limit, suitable traffic calming

measures will be identified and a submission for funding will be made to the appropriate

funding authority . It should be noted that any proposed speed limit extension cannot be

determined by the MD office. This motion will be referred to Roads Central Services for

consideration of the speed limit extension in the overall speed limit review for the City and

County.

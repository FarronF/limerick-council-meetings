The report, as circulated, was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor

O’Brien.

Discussion ensued in relation to the disposal of the Askeaton properties. Councillor

Keary was of the opinion these properties should be refurbished and offered to families

on the Local Authority housing waiting list and not sold to a developer. The Limerick City

and County Council Head of Property Management Department advised both properties

were in a derelict condition and as the Housing Department did not have the capability

to bring them back into housing stock use statutory notices were served on the owners

under the Derelict Sites Act 1990. Funding had been provided from the Rural Limerick

Housing Development fund to refurbish the properties and put them for sale on the

open market. The proposed purchaser is involved with local approved housing bodies

and social tenants will be accommodated in these properties going forward. As

Members were divided on whether these properties should be disposed of to a private

developer Councillor Teskey proposed a counter vote be cast to decide if the properties

should be disposed of or not.

The results of the voting was as follows:

**For the proposal:**

Councillor Collins, O’Brien, O’Donoghue and Sheahan.

**Against the proposal:**

Councillor Keary and Teskey.

The voting resulted in 4 for and 2 against the proposal, therefore the proposal to dispose

of the properties was carried.

Council granted an extension to the lifetime of the permission for a 5 year

period. The Council recently received a second application to extend the

granting this second application.

The wind energy development guidelines (2006) are the current relevant

guidelines in respect of wind farms.

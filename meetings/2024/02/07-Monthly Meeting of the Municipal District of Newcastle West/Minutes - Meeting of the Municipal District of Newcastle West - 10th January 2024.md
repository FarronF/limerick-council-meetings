***I will move at th*e next Municipal District Meeting for a pedestrian entrance to be sought at**

**the bridge dividing Ballaugh and Dromtrasna to access the Greenway.**

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council are proposing to develop the Limerick

Greenway hub/trailhead at Abbeyfeale. As this is 2.5km from Ballaugh it is not

proposed to develop a new access point at this location.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to safety concerns at the existing entrance

and requested that serious consideration be given to providing safer access for pedestrians

at this location. Following a brief discussion, the Director stated that a meeting onsite can be

arranged where further consideration will be given to this matter.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Municipal District Meeting for a survey to be carried out on all the***

***manhole covers from Mountmahon to Dalton**’**s Cross, Abbeyfeale, the Killarney Road,***

***Abbeyfeale, and also from Joy**’**s Corner to the Mart in Abbeyfeale.***

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that our Authority review its service contract with its***

***public lighting provider/s.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY:

As of December 2023, Limerick City and County Council manages and maintains 23577 lights

and their associated infrastructure within Limerick city and county. On the 12th of December

this year there were 319 noted faults within this network, which in turn corresponds to 1.3%

of the overall network.

Of that 1.3% or 319 faults, 120 faults require the attendance of the ESB in order to facilitate

the installation of interfaces and to deal with faults on the ESB network. The requirements for

ESB presence on site is necessary to comply with safety standards from Safe Electric that must

be adhered to.

We have escalated a number of cases to the ESB and we are working closely with their

Engineers on the ground, who have committed to facilitate us in so far as they can. We are

continuing to proactively manage these issues and are working closely with our maintenance

contractor (Enerveo) and the ESB to get these items closed out in a timely manner. It should

be noted that ESB is not a contractor/supplier to LCCC. They are the owners of the

infrastructure that needs the separation interface outlined above.

The remainder of the faults (199 or 0.8% of the PL stock) continue to be proactively managed

and repaired. As with all maintenance contracts there are and will continue to be challenges

encountered which will be managed in conjunction with our maintenance provider. In the last

number of years, we have switched to actively installing full LED heads as opposed to

replacing existing outdated technology (Sons and Sox fittings). This impacts the time required

to service lights but will improve energy usage and avoid paying for duplicate retro fits at the

same location when considering the upcoming Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project

(PLEEP) contract. It should also be noted that there has been an improvement in outstanding

faults since the start of the year.

Enerveo has actively sought to improve their service and provide additional resources and

recently have increased the number of crews to service Limerick.

Notwithstanding the significant constraints outlined above, Limerick City and County Council

continues to work closely with Enerveo and other stakeholders to provide a high level of

service.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan expressed dissatisfaction at the level of service

being provided and to the considerable length of time taken to repair street lights not working

in the District. Other Members concurred with Councillor Scanlan and a discussion took place

on a number of matters including statistics on the number of street lights not operational in

the District, dissatisfaction with the Service Level Agreement, how the service can be

improved upon and the Local Authority not having a contract with the ESB Network.

In replying, the Director acknowledged the work undertaken by the Directorate on this matter

and stated that statistics on the number of street lights not operational in the District can be

sought. Following discussion, it was agreed that a representative from the relevant

Directorate would be invited to attend the February Meeting of the District to discuss this

matter.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that our Authority avail of local auctioneering services***

***for its property sales within our Municipality.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council has during the month of November advertised on etenders

and in the Official Journal of the European Union for the Provision of Property and Valuation

Professional Services for the period 2024 – 2026, with an option to extend the tender for an

additional two years to 2028.

Procurement of goods, services and supplies within the Council is done in compliance with

National Law and EU Directives, in addition to the Councils’ Corporate Procurement Plan 2020

– 2024. This is done to promote open, transparent and equal treatment as a means of

achieving value for money in public spending and in no way demonstrate any form of

favouritism towards specific Economic Operators, e.g. local businesses. The EU Directives,

Guidelines and Principles of Procurement must be adhered to in order to protect the Council

from potential future litigation.

It was open to all those interested in providing such a service to the Council to submit a

tender, in the recent advertised competition, as a Panel of Auctioneers/Valuers was being put

in place.

The closing date for submission of tenders has now expired and it is hoped to have the panel

in place early in the new year. The Members will be circulated with details of those on the

panel in due course.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that auctioneers with local knowledge

provide the service at local level. Following a brief discussion, it was noted that the provision

of property and valuation professional services was recently advertised on etenders and that

all interested parties were invited to submit a Tender. It was also noted that a panel is to be

put in place in early 2024 which will be circulated to the Members in due course.

pedestrians that the public footpath be extended on the R524 Athea to Glin road from

by the District Office.

previously.

The following items were also raised.

Reference was made to speeding through the village of Feohanagh and an update was sought

on the placing of a spot speed indicator on the southern approach to Feohanagh village and

also the moving of the spot speed indicator out to the speed limit along the Monagea Road.

In replying, the Roads Team agreed to follow up further on this matter.

The poor condition of the Wood Road at Ardrine was raised and an update was sought on

when safety measures would be put in place along this road. In replying, the Roads Engineer

agreed to follow up on this matter.

The Members welcomed the installation of the tabletop crossing in the village of Athea.

However, reference was made to a minor issue with drainage and to a grid placed on the

table top to take the water at this location. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated

that this matter will be resolved shortly.

Reference was made to speeding on the R523 from The Pike in Ardagh to the Kerry bounds

and following a brief discussion on speed limits and the use of spot speed cameras in the

District it was agreed that a representative from the relevant Directorate would be invited to

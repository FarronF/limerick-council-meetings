Ms. Jurate Andrijauskiene, Staff Officer, Housing presented on Affordable Housing Purchase

Arrangements.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Stephen Keary sought clarification on the equity share and Ms.

Andrijauskiene explained the example in her presentation.

Ms. Dee Ryan, CEO, Limerick Chamber asked if the part redemption payment was the same on each

payment. Ms. Andrijauskiene replied that redemption payments can be made at any time subject to

a minimum amount of €10,000.00.

Cllr. Tom Collopy stated that there was a lot of detail in the presentation and asked that the

presentation is circulated.

Cllr. Tom Ruddle enquired how applications are going to date. Ms. Andrijauskiene advised that most

applicants that applied are eligible for the scheme and whilst it is not a requirement it is

recommended that prior to applying for an affordable home, that applicants have a Mortgage

Approval in Principle letter from a mortgage provider.

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary asked how the scheme is advertised, are applicants put on a

panel for future schemes and if an applicant’s income changes are they still eligible? Ms.

Andrijauskiene advised that Affordable Schemes are advertised when they become available, each

new scheme requires a new application to be submitted and all previous applicants are contacted to

reapply if interested. Ms. Andrijauskiene clarified that the Affordable Scheme of Priority outlines the

method the local authority uses to determine the order of priority to be given to each household

where the demand for a development exceeds the supply. Ms. Andrijauskiene advised that the

purchase price is based on an applicant’s purchasing power i.e. 4 times gross household income,

please a minimum deposit of 10% of the purchase price, plus in limited circumstances any relevant

savings.

Item 4(a)

Ms. Martina Frawley, Administrative Officer, Housing presented on the “Examination of potential of

a pilot scheme for the sale of Council houses in need of refurbishment at low cost to people on the

housing list”.

A discussed took place. Cllr. Tom Ruddle commented that any scheme progressed should be viable.

Cllr. Sean Hartigan highlighted that a property has to be vacant for at least 2 years to avail of the

vacant property refurbishment grant. Cllr. Hartigan asked if there could be further investigation into

the Incremental Purchase Scheme for non-local authority tenants.

Ms. Dee Ryan, Limerick Chamber commented that most purchase/refurbishment scheme are

national and have a criteria with only a small number of person’s being eligible and she would

welcome further investigation to extend those eligible.

Cllr. Sharon Benson highlighted that the cost of refurbishment is high and asked for clarification on

how properties are classified as new builds. Ms. Frawley advised that legal advice is required to

determine if a property refurbished to turnkey new build condition is deemed legally to the criteria

of a new build property.

Cllr. Stephen Keary stated that he would welcome a New Build Incremental Scheme but stated that a

lot of people will not qualify, it’s overly prescriptive and that all person’s with a housing need should

be given the opportunity to buy under the scheme. Cllr. Keary requested a workshop to consider the

matter further.

Ms. Caroline Curley, Director of Service, Housing advised that the Council are willing to engage with

the Department on the scheme.

Ms. Dee Ryan, Limerick Chamber asked if Limerick City and County Council can examine properties

which are subject to a compulsory purchase order to make them available under Affordable or Cost

Rental Schemes.

Ms. Anne Cronin, Community/Voluntary Sectorial Representative advised that she has concerns

around the Council diminishing its social housing stock. Ms. Curley advised that the Council

developed the policy at the request of the SPC.

Ms. Dee Ryan suggested that we shouldn’t diminish Housing Stock and this should be considered in

tenure mix workshop discussions.

Cllr. Conor Sheehan highlighted that we should be putting more pressure on Government on

turnaround times on voids and refurbishment and that properties vacant for years is not acceptable.

Cllr. Sheehan added that the Affordable Housing Scheme should be called a market discount

scheme.

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary highlighted that it is the aspiration of young couples to own

their own homes, that AHB’s are acquiring a significant number of units in housing estates and that

house prices are unaffordable.

Ms. Curley advised the members that the Council have statutory obligations.

Item 4(b) Consideration to be given to examination of dwellings compulsorily acquired under the---
4

Derelict Sites Act with a view to offering a portion to first time buyers on the housing list

is deferred for discussion to the 2024 Home and Social Development SPC.

**Item 5: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson and referred to SPC**

At Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick held on 16th October, 2023, the following Notice

of Motion was referred to the Home and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee for

consideration

“I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that where a homeowner

or Council tenant has an identified requirement for a sensory room and space is unavailable within

the property, that modular units will be allowed for under the current housing grants, which

currently only allow for traditional build units.”

Cllr. Tom Collopy welcomed and supported the motion.

Mr. Joe McDonald, Senior Staff Officer, Housing read a response to the Notice of Motion to the

committee. The response highlighted that The Housing (Adaptation Grants for Older People and

People with a Disability), Regulations 2007 provides the legislative framework for grants and allows

for additional accommodation or adaptation of an existing dwelling only.

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary stated that he is fully supportive of the motion and is aware of

a company based in Limerick who construct modular-built homes in their factory.

Cllr. Ruddle stated he supports same considering the speed at which a housing unit can be built

using modular construction.

Cllr. Sheehan also supported the motion and asked if the SPC could write to the Minister in relation

to updating the 2017 building guidelines.

Cllr. Eddie Ryan welcomed that motion and enquired about planning permission for modular homes.

Cllr. Keary advised that there may be some exemptions with extensions and the planning authority

could advise further.

Cllr. Benson and Cllr. Keary discussed the costs of traditional built extensions versus modular builds

and highlighted that the modular option costs are far less. Cllr. Keary asked if a visit to view modular

housing could be arranged. Ms. Mary Hayes advised that we can explore same.

Ms. Mary Hayes, Senior Executive Officer, Housing stated that the Council could consider modern

methods of construction and will investigate further with the relevant Housing personnel.

**Item 6:** **Limerick Chamber Presentation “Business Community requirement for Housing in**

**Limerick”**

Mr. Seán Golden, Chief Economist/Director of Policy, Limerick Chamber presented on Business

Community requirement for Housing in Limerick. The presentation was welcomed and well received

by the committee.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Benson stated that Affordable Housing is private housing and that we

need housing for everyone.---

Cllr. Keary stated that AHB tenants currently can’t purchase their own home. Cllr. Keary also stated

that he has concerns that future employers could be deterred by the lack of availability of housing.

Mr. Golden added that this is not a barrier at the moment, that employers want value added for

their staff and housing availability will be an issue eventually. Mr. Golden stressed that Limerick is

competing internationally.

Cllr. Keary added that we should incentivise and promote apartment living. Mr. Golden agreed and

stated that we need to look at housing strategically and opportunities for employees to walk or cycle

to work.

Mr. Brendan Kidney, Senior Engineer asked Limerick Chamber if they have looked at occupancy

levels in Housing Stock for example empty nesters. Mr. Golden replied that they do not currently

have solid data on same.

Ms. Anne Cronin, Community/Voluntary Sectorial Representative stated that she looks forward to

reading the mid-west rental monitor report when published in January. Ms. Cronin asked Limerick

Chamber if they have any comment on student housing at Punches Cross not going ahead. Mr.

Golden, Limerick Chamber stated that it’s a huge loss and that student’s make up over 25,000 of the

population. Ms. Cronin stated that students are a significant cohort and at the bottom of housing

priorities. Mr. Golden, Limerick Chamber stated that there will be future opportunities for student

residences for example the former Railway Hotel and Cleeves factory site.

Ms. Cronin stated that there are competing housing priorities everywhere and we need Approved

Housing Bodies to continue delivering opportunities. Mr. Golden, Limerick Chamber commented

that Approved Housing Bodies are doing an incredible job but that workers can’t compete with the

state for Housing. Ms. Ryan, Limerick Chamber also acknowledged the excellent work of Approved

Housing Bodies and stated that they would like to see equal delivery of affordable housing or cost

rental. Ms. Ryan added the Chamber would like to see AHB’s developing on their own land rather

than competing.

Cllr. Keary commented that there needs to be adequate and reasonable accommodation for

graduates and that the growth of colleges has enhanced employment. Cllr. Keary asked if Limerick

Chambers presentation could be distributed.

191 projects were funded in 2023.

annual funding has impacted organisations.

Ms. Una Burns, Social Inclusion Representative asked if it’s expected that organisations previously

where are these units located?

criteria regarding centre of interest to access emergency accommodation. Has the Council

contributed to this proposed amendment and what are the implications for people that have

difficulty establishing a centre of interest that present as homeless.

Ms. Triona O’Connor, Administrative Officer, Housing advised that the majority of units are in

hostels and shared housing models. Ms. O’Connor stated that the Council has contributed as part of

the CCMA subgroup and a submission is with the Minister’s office for review. Ms. O’Connor added

that every homeless case is treated individually.

Ms. Anne Cronin, Community/Voluntary Sectorial Representative highlighted that any amendment

to the Housing Act to introduce eligibility criteria regarding centre of interest to access emergency

accommodation will be a very significant change, will have severe implications and impact on certain

cohorts of people. Ms. Cronin further added that a number of organisations are very concerned

considering homelessness numbers are increasing.

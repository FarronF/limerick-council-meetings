**Item 2: Presentation: Road Safety Plan - Karen McDonnell, Executive Planner**

Ms. Karen McDonnell delivered a presentation outlining the aims of the National Road Safety

Strategy 2021-2030 and the Road Safety Plan for Limerick. She summarised the critical success

factors to reach the targets in the plan to improve the safety of roads.

The Chair thanked Ms. McDonnell and opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Secas noted that the elected Members have no representative on the working group and

asked if there was national funding for implementing the plan.

In response Ms. McDonnell confirmed that the working group is an interagency group comprising

of representatives from roads, emergency services and local stakeholder groups, and that there

are no elected members on the working group at present.

There is no specific funding allocation for implementing the plan, however, many of the actions

identified within the plan have existing funding streams.

Mayor Mitchell stated the aim of National Road Safety Strategy to reduce road deaths and serious

injuries by 50% is very ambitious. More education is needed as speed is a problem on roads. The

silence of EV’s is also a factor of safety. He referred to the issues of E-Scooters and added that

Gardaí enforcement is needed and on the spot fines.

**Item 3: Presentation: Traffic Calming Policy - Mr. Hugh McGrath, S.E.**

Mr. Hugh McGrath delivered a presentation on the Traffic Calming Policy and explained the

requirement to review the current (2018) Traffic Calming policy. He clarified the aspects to be

reviewed including the scope, funding, assess the appropriateness of existing measures and

regularise measure/ramps of various type and profile.

The Chair thanked Mr. McGrath for the presentation and opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. McSweeney referenced London 2005 in the presentation and would like to think we have a

lot to learn from the UK. Traffic calming can save lives and LCCC in his opinion should have

designated funding.

Cllr. O’Donovan welcomed the timely plan and added that the scope needs to be increased. She

referenced the traffic calming on the Ballinacurra/Rosbrien Road and also the difficulty in cycling

on the Shelbourne Road due to traffic congestion. She suggested making some roads one-way

and increasing footpaths, (e.g. on the Rosbrien Road), as this would reduce speed and the volume

of cars. She also asked for clarity on a ‘strategic route’.

Cllr. O’Hanlon stated that in the event of traffic calming measures in residential areas, a petition

has to be undertaken and a survey carried out. This process in his opinion is the cart before the

horse. He referenced a Garryowen survey in which the residents requested traffic calming

measures and a survey was undertaken by an engineer. Residents were confident that works

would commence, however it was decided that the works were not suitable. He suggested that

the engineers should carry out the survey first and then inform residents.---

He gave an example of 10 residents living on the road between the Dublin Road and Aldi,

however, 2000 approx. people are affected as it is a dangerous crossing and councillors are

getting requests for Traffic calming measures.

In response to Cllr. McSweeney, Mr. McGrath advised that the existing policy looked at policies

with other local authorities and Limerick is re-examining the impacts of traffic calming on bus

routes and priority routes. He referenced London in the presentation as London specifically

addressed bus routes. He added that the budget is very important, as well as the need to

prioritise traffic calming measures within any budget.

In response to Cllr. O’Donovan, Mr. McGrath advised that a strategic road is considered to be

strategic by virtue of the number and/or type of vehicles using it. While Shelbourne Road is a

regional road, it is suitable for traffic calming measures as it addresses speed issues near an

existing school.

In response to Cllr. O’Hanlon, Mr. McGrath stated that the existing policy is limited in scope and

was intended for residential areas. He added that it is accepted that there is a need to consider

the approach to surveys better. There is also a need to take overall account of community and

through traffic, and not just residents in an area in certain locations such as Dublin Road at the

Parkway. Speed control measures need to be examined to get the balance right and get the

consultation right. Mr. McGrath advised that he would take Cllr. O’Hanlon’s suggestion on board

with regard to surveys.

Mayor Mitchell welcomed road safety and added that he had to get ramps installed outside his

constituency office. He stated that most accidents occur on local roads and the authority has to

slow down traffic. Ramps are not regularised; some are effective, and some are not and need to

be assessed. He asked when ramps would be regularised and the noise level addressed.

Cllr. Secas referenced the assessment criteria and asked how those criteria will change. Following

a request for speed ramps, she got a petition signed by almost 100% of residents but the response

from the engineer was negative and ramps not warranted. She suggested that speed surveys

should be carried out in consultation with residents as sometimes they are not done at the right

time e.g. when schools are closed. The selection criteria need to be revised and should include

the best time provision on the document.

The Chair welcomed that the focus is taken away from speed ramps, however, it is probably not

the end of speed ramps as they do an amazing job at schools. She added that there are a lot of

schools on the Dublin Road and knowing what is on the road should be applied as an additional---

check when deciding on traffic calming. She referenced Brookville Avenue and Childers Road,

both now at 50kp/h. Since the Active Travel measures, they are now narrower roads, and it is

hard to go faster than 50kp/h. Section38 gives a wide range of measures but if there is no funding

available, this could be an issue and it is about managing expectations.

In response to Mayor Mitchell, Mr. McGrath advised that local roads can be targeted, and the

working group will coordinate all suggestions.

In relation to surveys highlighted by Cllr. Secas and Cllr O’Hanlon, Mr. McGrath advised that

engineers usually have a good knowledge on an area and should be able to give an indication if

there is a problem that is likely to meet the threshold to assist those making the request.

In response to the Chair, Mr. McGrath advised that it is a priority to facilitate bus and vehicular

traffic and agreed that speed ramps could be done in a less detrimental manner in certain

locations. He will take on the views expressed today and take all suggestions on board.

**Item 4: Presentation: Control of Car Club/ Car Share Bye Laws -** **John O’Leary, A/S.E.E.**

Mr. O’Leary introduced the Car Clubs/Carshare services and highlighted the benefits. He added

that a pilot Carshare Service was established between LCCC and GoCar in 2019 and complies with

policy documents in the LSMATS (Measure SM10) and Limerick Development plan 2022-2028

(Objective TRO20). Draft Bye Laws are currently undergoing legal review to be followed by

procurement of a license operator.

The Members thanked Mr. O’Leary for the presentation and the Chair opened the floor to

questions.

Cllr. O’Donovan advised that Enterprise cars also do the Car Club scheme, and she regularly uses

GoCars. She added that the busy Barrington Street location serves many on the west side of the

city. She asked if members would have a say where GoCars are located. In her opinion, the one

at the Strand Hotel is not working well and she suggested moving it further down the road and

use the location for disabled parking instead.

The Chair asked when location is decided to also consider the Car free housing development

and also asked if the EV provision will be incentivized. In relation to Tender, she also asked if

there will be more than 20 GoCars and if the project is approved only for the city or if the

county is included.---

In response to questions, Mr. O’Leary advised that the number, locations and uses, including the

Strand Hotel, will be reviewed and agreed between LCCC and any preferred bidder during the

license tender process. Once the scheme is in operation, locations will be reviewed on an

ongoing basis. The provision of Electric Car Club Vehicles by the licensed operator will be

incentivized during the tender process. The procurement process for a licensed operator will be

for the entire Limerick area, with the initial byelaws covering the City & Environs area.

In response to the Chair, Mr. O’Leary advised that it is intended that EV will form part of the

service provision by the eventual license holder however, as seen with the EV Charging Pilot

Project there are significant challenges to the location of chargers due to existing grid capacity

with ESB Networks. As part of the EV Charging Pilot Project, a 22kw supply has been included for

a Car Club charger opposite Colbert Station.

The Chair thanked the members and presenters and wished everybody a happy Christmas. She

confirmed that the next meeting is Tuesday, the 13th of February 2024.

This concluded the business of the meeting.---

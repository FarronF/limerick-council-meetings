The Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing gave Members a presentation

on the review of the Schedule of Municipal District Works for 2023.

Following the presentation, discussion ensued and the following issues were raised by

Members:

Newbridge, Askeaton. The Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing

agreed to liaise with Irish Rail on the matter and revert in due course.

 Councillor Sheahan requested flood barriers be installed at The Quay, Askeaton

due to concerns from residents that spring tides in Askeaton brought higher water

levels than previous years on the quay.

 Councillor Sheahan advised contractors laying cables on the Ballyallinan –

Barrigone Road in Askeaton damaged the road and requested the contractor

return to the site and carry out repairs to the road.

of Askeaton Town at a location to be agreed with the local community.

in Rathkeale Town.

**I will move at the next Meeting that this District lobby both Minister Helen McEntee TD**

**and Minister Jennifer Carroll MacNeill TD to immediately make stronger and more**

**robust legislation available to allow for a central insurance claim register that would be**

**meaningful in targeting the issue of repeated bogus claims. The register should be linked**

**with one's PPS number to target individuals who repeatedly or possibly make regular**

**bogus claims in order to profit from one's insurance.**

**8.**

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor S. Keary**

**I will move at the next Meeting no election poster for the 2024 local elections are**

**erected in the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District area.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Keary and seconded by Councillor Sheahan.

**Reply:**

The legal requirements in relation to the erection of election posters are set

out in the Litter Pollution Act 1997 (as amended) and the Electoral

(Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009, which provides that posters may only be

erected for a certain specified time period before a poling date and must

be removed within 7 days of Polling Day. There are also legal requirements

in place in relation to the proximity of posters being erected near polling

stations, as well as requirements relating to posters not being on traffic and

road signs, hanging off bridges, etc. Further draft legislation in relation to

this area, namely the Regulation of display of Electoral and Polling Posters

and Other Advertisements Bill 2022, is also currently before the Oireachtas.

The current legislation, therefore, allows for posters to be erected during

an election period. However, it is open to the Elected Members of the

Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District to agree not to erect election posters in

the run up to the Local Government Elections in June 2024, but such a

decision is strictly by voluntary agreement of the Elected Members.

Following discussion, Councillor Keary withdrew his motion.

**9.**

**Notice of Motion received from Councillor B. Collins**

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council engages with**

**Communities to establish Poster Free Zones in each town and village within the Adare-**

**Rathkeale Municipal District.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Collins and seconded by Councillor O’Brien.

Councillor Keary asked Councillor Collins to also withdraw her motion, however,

Councillor Collins did not agree. Councillor Keary proposed a counter vote be cast to

decide if the District should be in favour or not in favour of poster free zones.

The results of the voting was as follows:

**For the proposal:**

Councillors Collins, O’Brien and O’Donoghue.

**Against the proposal:**

Councillors Keary, Sheahan and Teskey.

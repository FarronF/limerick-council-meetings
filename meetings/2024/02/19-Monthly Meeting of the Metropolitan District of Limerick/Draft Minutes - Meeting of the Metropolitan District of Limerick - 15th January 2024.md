due for completion in Q1 2024. The guiding principle of this project is the creation of a

strategic direction for Limerick City and County Council to facilitate the deployment of

Electric Vehicle charge points across the City and County.

The strategy will focus on identifying the demand for charge points across all types of

charging and will specifically identify public residential and destinationbased charging
---

needs up to 2025 and 2030. The power demand and charge point demand will be identified

at Municipal District level. We will then work with the private sector and other organisations

to support the demand based requirements and to identify suitable locations within each

MD area for chargers.

In tandem with the development of the EV Charging Strategy, Limerick City and County

Council are progressing a pilot EV charging project. This project will focus on

delivering public residentialand destination charging solutions at a number of locations

around the city and county. This initiative is one of the first of its kind in Ireland and will

serve as a valuable learning experience, not only for Limerick but also for other local

authorities across the country.

The pilot sites are located at:

1. Mungret Park,

2. Castletroy Park,

3. County Hall Dooradoyle (public area),

4. Dooradoyle Park,

5. Merchant’s Quay (Newgate Lane),

6. O’Callaghan Strand,

In addition to the work taking place locally by Limerick City and County Council, the Zero

Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) office are developing a National En-Route EV Charging

Network Plan and  its implementationwill have a number of schemes to deliver charge

points.

Through the development and implementation of these local and national projects,

together with the work being undertaken by the private sector, there will be a projected

increase in EV charging infrastructure inthe LimerickCity & County area.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, as a number of Part 8***

***planning proposals are scheduled to be presented to forthcoming Metropolitan District***

***Meetings, some of which are presented as proposed Community Dwellings, can I get clarification***

***on who is eligible/entitled to be housed in these proposed Community Dwellings.***

**REPLY**: ‘Time to Move On from Community Settings’ is a HSE strategy supporting the movement of

people with disabilities from large institutions (congregated settings) to smaller and more

independent settings within the community – i.e., Community Dwellings. Various Service

Providers (e.g. Tusla, Approved Housing Bodies, HSE) would provide the supports that these

persons would then require within their Community Dwelling. The HSE and Approved

Housing Bodies, with the support of Limerick City and County Council, are both active in

developing suitable housing (known as community dwellings) into which congregated

settings residents can transition.

Any Community Dwelling projects delivered by or funded by Limerick City and County

Council would be done so on the condition that the units are occupied by persons approved

on the Social Housing Waiting List.

Housing circulars 45/2015 and more recently 32/2019 states that a maximum of four

individuals with a disability and one support worker may be accommodated in an individual

shared Community dwelling. In many instances, Limerick City and County Council works

closely with Approved Housing Bodies for the delivery of Community Dwellings in the City

and County to support the de-congestion of larger facilities such as the Brothers of Charity’s

Bawnmore Facility or Avista’s St. Vincent’s Centre at Lisnagry.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an outline of what***

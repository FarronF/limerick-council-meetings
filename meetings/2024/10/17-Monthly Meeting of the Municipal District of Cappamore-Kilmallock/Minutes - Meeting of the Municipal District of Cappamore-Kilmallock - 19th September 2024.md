default speed limits due to be introduced on the local roads network in November 2024
explaining these measures aim to improve safety on the road network for all users.
Seamus O'Reilly (SEE) explained to members that surveys had been undertaken in the
District to determine which local roads met the criteria to retain a 80kph speed limit and
added however that none of those assessed met the qualifying criteria, therefore all Local
roads in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District will default to the new 60kph speed
limit.

Members raised concerns around enforcement of the new speed limits. Seamus O'Reilly
assured members a number of advertising campaigns would be undertaken in the lead up
to implementation of the new speed limits and also advised members his Department was
awaiting delivery of new signage to coincide with same.

Members agreed the logistics involved to implement the new signage was considerable.
All members welcomed the introduction of the new speed limits which they hoped would
lead to improved safety and a reduction in road fatalities.

Councillor Conway (G) requested if traffic calming measures could be introduced in the
vicinity of Effin GAA club in the interests of road safety. T.McKechnie (SEE) agreed to
examine the location queried in line with the new LCCC Traffic Calming Policy and revert
to Councillor Conway in due course. It was noted that the new default speed limits on
local roads would reduce the speed at Effin GAA Club to 60kph.

Councillor O’Sullivan (T) raised an issue with the new periodic speed limit sign which
appears to be on permanently near the national school in Ardpatrick. T McKechnie (SEE)
advised this would be investigated as the periodic speed limit applied only during school
drop off and pick up times.

6. Forward Planning

The elected members welcomed Maria Woods, Senior Planner, (Forward Planning and
Public Realm) to the meeting to provide a briefing to consider the Mayors Report and
resolve to extend the life of the Kilmallock Local Area Plan 2019-2025 a further three years
to coincide with the Limerick City and County Council Dev. Plan.

Maria explained the same issues in the current Local Area Plan would still apply with the
next Local Area Plan for Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District due next year.
Members queried what the position would be in the interim should an amendment be
required to the Plan before 2028.

Maria Woods, Senior Planner informed Members an amendment to the existing plan
between now and 2028 could be looked at once it aligned with planning criteria set out
the County Development Plan.Members agreed with the explanation given by Maria
Woods in requesting extension of current local area plan until 2028.

13. Question submitted by Councillor O’Sullivan

“t will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an update
on the proposal for a footpath in Anglesboro to connect the National School to the
crossroads in the village and if there are any plans to construct a footpath from the
Cluaindara Estate to the same junction.”

REPLY:

The Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District office had proposed previously to construct a
new footpath connecting Anglesboro Nationa! School to the main crossroads junction in the
village. The works required land acquisition which could not be agreed. With respect to a
footpath from the Cluaindara Estate, there are no plans or funding in place to deliver this
infrastructure. The Roads Engineer can explore if a footpath could be delivered, but it should
be noted that land acquisition would be required at this location as well.

14. Question submitted by Councillor Conway

| will ask at the next Cappamore-Kilmallock area meeting for an update on a considerable
development contribution in respect of the proposed childcare facility in Bruff since
planning permission has been granted for 74 houses to Ballygrennan Homes Ltd.

REPLY:

The Limerick City and County Councils Development Contribution Scheme 2022 was
developed based on the Council's projected Capital Programme, and no creche facilities
were included in the list of identified projects, as set out in Appendix B. Section 48 of the
Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended specifically states that “the basis for the
determination of a contribution shall be set out in a development contribution scheme made
under this section”.

Therefore, while the Council recognises the need for childcare facilities, the current Limerick
Development Contribution Scheme does not provide for the construction or funding or a
creche in Bruff, It is suggested that alternative funding sources should be sought, such as
the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth ‘Building blocks
Capital Grant’.

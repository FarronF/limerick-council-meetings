property. This scheme is for households not on the

Social Housing Waiting List. To be eligible for the

CRTiS scheme, the net annual income of the

household is to be below €59,000.00 net per

***Council has any plans for double yellow lines to be installed along Huntsfield Drive in Huntsfield***

***Estate, Dooradoyle to stop the excessive parking on footpaths along this main entrance to the***

***estate.***

**REPLY:** The Limerick City & County Council Traffic Team will review with the Traffic Authority An

Garda Síochana Roads Policing Unit to determine if double yellow lines are practical along

Huntsfield Drive in Huntsfield Estate, Dooradoyle for traffic enforcement purposes.

Poor parking practices such as parking on footpaths and at entrances can be enforced by a

effort to maximise the number of extra spaces available with our various providers. In 2023

we were able to agree 12 extra spaces and we would be confident of securing this number

completed. Limerick City and County Council Homeless Action Team have an excellent

working relationship with the service providers and the street outreach team and in the

event of a cold or extreme weather warning coming into effect would be in a position to

engage with any rough sleepers supporting them to access beds and also supports around

**23.Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many businesses are***

***in compliance and arrears with rates in the Metropolitan District. How many pay nothing and***

***what additional steps are being taken to improve rate take up.***

**REPLY**: The following gives details of all Ratepayers at 31st December, 2023:

 4,094 or 85% of Customers are fully compliant

 433 or 9% of Customers are on Payment Plans

 281 or 6% of Customers did not pay in 2023 – *Note: this includes accounts in*

*liquidation/receivership/in probate and also a number of accounts where the premises*

*are vacant and the Rates Section are awaiting vacancy forms from the owners*.

As in prior years, the Council continued to initiate legal proceedings in cases where no

progress was being made in recovering the arrears due. It should be noted that

considerable progress has been made in reducing the long term arrears, due to the Council.

As can be seen from the above, many of our customers are now on payment plans or paying

by Direct Debit which are designed to clear the arrears in a timely manner while at the same

time easing the burden for the Ratepayer. The Council also offers an annual Small &

Medium Business Support Scheme, where the ratepayer may be entitled to 13.5% rebate

of their annual rates, up to a maximum grant of €1,500 if the applicant is paying their Rates

by Direct Debit or pays their annual rates in full by 31st July.---
11

The Council continues to encourage customers who are experiencing difficulties to engage

with their Account Manager, as soon as possible.

**24.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if a strategic plan or city-***

***wide mapped overview is in place for all SHIP, HAP, AHB and CAS social housing particularly with***

***a focus on ensuring that the government’s ‘Mixed Tenure Communities’ policy is upheld, thus***

***ensuring good management by AHBs of their tenants and to support sustainable communities***

***across Limerick City.***

**REPLY**: The term "mixed-tenure" typically refers to residential projects where various types of

housing tenure and therefore different economic groups are provided. This involves a blend

of ownership, private rental, social-rental, and affordable housing (both affordable sale and

affordable rental) integrated within the same development. Mixed tenure is often viewed

as a way to address some of the social issues linked with mono-tenure schemes, such as

large-scale social housing schemes.

Nationally, the mixed-tenure policy is promoted as a policy under ‘Housing for All’, but

without specific guidelines on how it should be implemented.

Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) has developed a more structured approach for

implementing a mixed-tenure policy. For large-scale housing developments (over 40 units)

proposed to LCCC as turnkey projects for example, the following approach has been agreed

with the Elected Members of Limerick City and County Council:

 A minimum of 20% private housing

 A minimum of 50% private affordable housing

 A maximum of 30% social-rental housing, including private rightsizing and Part V

properties

For acquisitions, leases, or turnkeys with fewer than 40 units, where social-rental tenure is

proposed, a thorough pre-assessment process is followed:

 A review of housing needs in the area for the proposed property types, with

consultation via the I-house system and confirmation from the Housing Support Services

Allocations unit of the waiting list for the bed type proposed.

 An evaluation of the level of social-rental housing (including Housing Assistance

Payment [HAP]) in the area to avoid an overconcentration of any one tenure type. The

approach of the Housing Directorate is no more than 30% on a street-by-street basis.

 An analysis of the HP Pobal Deprivation Index for the area to ensure that areas classified

as ‘extremely disadvantaged’ or ‘very disadvantaged’ are not recommended for

progression.

 In relation to acquisitions, a check to ensure that no first-time buyers are bidding. The

Housing Directorate seeks confirmation from the vendor/Estate Agent that first-time---
12

buyers are not involved in bidding for the property. If they are, the Housing Directorate

will not support the acquisition of the unit.

Overall, the implementation of Limerick City and County Council's mixed-tenure policy has

been successful in fostering balanced and integrated communities. The structured

approach to both large and small-scale developments has generally achieved the intended

goals of avoiding mono-tenure areas and overconcentration of social-rental housing.

However, as with any policy, there have been a small number of cases where challenges

have arisen, but these are being actively addressed to ensure the long-term success and

sustainability of the policy.

**25.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what the projected Per Cent***

***for Art budget currently is that can be generated from all capital projects underway or planned***

***across all departments and sections in the Council.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council -

The Arts Office commenced a process in August 2024 to gather data on the Per Cent for

Arts Scheme programme within each Directorate of the Council. The data requested

includes the following: Capital Project title/type; details of funding source or Department;

Total capital construction cost; Whether the Per cent for Art Scheme budget line was

included in the overall capital construction project budget estimate (at inception of the

project and at time of submission to relevant Government Department); Details of the

budget that has been ring-fenced for Per Cent for Arts Scheme project and details of the

current status of the relevant project.

The data collection process is currently underway, and data submissions from Directorates

will be compiled by the arts office. This process will inform in relation to projected budgets

that can be generated from capital projects underway or planned. Alignment of projects

and programmes with the new National Per Cent for Arts Policy framework and Limerick

City and County Council Public Art Policy 2024-2030 will be reviewed.

**26.Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what steps have been taken***

***by the new Night Time Economy Officer to engage with traders and businesses to develop new***

***partnerships to encourage initiatives that will generate an economic impact for Limerick City***

***from Samhain Festival, Lighting Up Limerick for Christmas, St Brigid’s Day, St Patrick’s*** ***Day, and***

***what offerings are in place for these festivals.***

**REPLY**: In response to Councillor M. Donoghue's query, it is useful to clarify the roles and

responsibilities in relation to both the Night Time Economy, and Festivals and Events.

The coordination and delivery of the civic festivals including St. Brigid's Day, St. Patrick's Day,

Riverfest, Samhain and Christmas in Limerick are delivered primarily by the Festival and

Events team who are also responsible for the allocated budget for these events.---
13

The Night Time Economy (NTE) Advisor holds an advisory role, providing input and support

to the Festivals and Events team and other teams/stakeholders, as required. For example,

in the current preparation for the Samhain festival, the NTE Advisor is collaborating closely

with the Festivals and Events team to deliver a window dressing incentive for local

businesses along the parade route.  The Advisor is coordinating discussions with larger

retailers, encouraging them to lead by example and participate in the festivities.

Additionally, the NTE Advisor will facilitate connection between large retailers and a local

theatre group to explore creative opportunities for Halloween-themed decorations. This

initiative aims to enhance the vibrancy of the city, generate enthusiasm, and increase

footfall during the event. Similar collaborative discussions and exchanges of ideas from a

night-time economy perspective will continue to take place in preparation for future

festivals.

Separately, the NTE Advisor has engaged collaboratively with city centre stakeholders,

traders and businesses on a number of collaborative and innovative initiatives aimed at

generating economic impact and activity in the Night Time Economy. These include:

 A recently launched **NTE Innovation Grant Scheme** to encourage new, unique, and

diverse night-time activities within the city. This initiative has been well received, with

several events already scheduled to take place in and around Halloween. The scheme

has fostered collaboration between creative individuals and existing businesses,

encouraging the meanwhile use of underutilised spaces in the city and promoting a

more vibrant and dynamic night-time economy.

 The Night Time Economy Advisor has initiated and supported several activities that have

successfully brought economic benefits to Limerick City and will be evaluated for

ongoing potential. For instance, during the Mayoral initiative in August, we launched a

series of night markets on Nicholas Street in collaboration with Treaty Brewery and

other local food and arts industries.

 A pop up cinema was established and held over 3 weeks, in partnership with a local

provider and in collaboration with three city centre venues, namely St Marys Cathedral,

the Wickham Way and the People’s Museum. These were held over three weeks with

an excellent response (some were sold out).

 An outdoor film screening was organised in collaboration with Film Limerick, and the

Hunt Museum hosted a series of late openings on Thursday nights, which include events

running until mid-September.

 A two-week series of summer night walks, free to the public, saw high levels of

engagement from both locals and visitors, significantly increasing foot traffic and

patronage to local businesses.

The primary objectives of the NTE Advisor’s role are outlined in the Service Level Agreement

between Limerick City and County Council and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts,

Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (TCAGSM). The key component of these objectives is the

development of an Action Plan that is stakeholder-led and addresses critical issues related

to the night-time economy in Limerick. An extensive consultation plan is currently

underway, aiming to gather input from a wide range of stakeholders. The outcome of this

consultation process will shape the Action Plan, a draft of which is expected in the coming---
14

months. The approved Action Plan will focus on key issues identified and will be delivered

over the following 12 months, prior to evaluation upon completion of the pilot programme.

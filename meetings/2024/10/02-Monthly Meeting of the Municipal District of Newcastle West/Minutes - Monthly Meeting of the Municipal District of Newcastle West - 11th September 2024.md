grounds and that a substantial increase in funding is to be sought in the forthcoming budget.

implementation group was set up to review and reduce speed limits where appropriate. He
stated that the purpose of the review was to address both road safety issues and carbon
emissions. He stated that the group consisted of key state stakeholders including the
Department of Transport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, National Transport Authority, An
Garda Siochana and the Local Authority sector.

The Senior Executive Engineer noted that legislation was amended in respect of the default
speed limits on the 12" April, 2024 and that the Bill addresses key matters in road safety
legislating for safer default speed limits in line with the Department's speed limit review
published in September 2023. He stated that default speed limits will be lowered (a) on
national secondary roads, from 100km/h to 80km/h, (b) on local roads from 80km/h to
60km/h, (c) on roads in built-up areas from SOkm/h to 30km/h. He also stated that the
introduction of these measures would apply suitable default speed limits to the relevant road
types and environments, aim to improve road safety and have a decrease in serious incidents
and road deaths.

He made reference to the Department of Transport who have indicated that the Bill will be
commenced in phases and that the first phase will be the implementation of the local roads
default from the current 80km/h to 60km/h. He stated that the second phase is the
implementation of the national secondary roads default from the current 100km/h to 80km/h
and also on roads in built up areas from the default of S0km/h to 30km/h. He referred to the
third phase which will examine particular areas of sensitivity such as schools or locations
where VRU’s are the predominant road user.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that Phase 1 has commenced with a view to the
introduction of revised speed limits in November 2024 with Phase 2 commencing in the first
part of 2025.

He referred to the Statutory Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland
which outline when and where a local road may be considered for a higher speed limit. He
stated that these guidelines set out specific criteria which must be met in order to increase
the speed limit from the default 60kph and gave an overview to the Members on this matter.
He also stated that as part of the Limerick Assessment, Limerick City and County Council
identified thirty two roads which were considered for a higher speed limit and which merited
areview, However, following assessment no local roads have met the criteria for an increase
in speed limit.

In conclusion, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that Phase 1 of the speed limit review is
ongoing and the default limit of 60kph will apply from the scheduled date of November 2024.
He made reference to the byelaws which are currently being reviewed, however this is not a
requirement for Phase 1 and the default speed limit of 60kph will apply to all local roads from
November 2024. He stated that Limerick City and County Council are currently working with
the Department with regard to procurement and installation of the necessary signage.

The Members thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for the comprehensive presentation.
While the Members were in favour of road safety, dissatisfaction was expressed on the 60kph
Default Speed Limits being put in place for local roads. The Members referred to the financial

costs involved, the importance of enforcing proper speed on our roads, the importance of
average speed cameras, speeding on approach to schools, maintenance of roadside trees and
speed limit signage on our roads.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer informed the Members that Transport
Infrastructure Ireland are currently carrying out trials nationally with a view to bringing in
average speed cameras, however he noted that Limerick was not included in this trial. He

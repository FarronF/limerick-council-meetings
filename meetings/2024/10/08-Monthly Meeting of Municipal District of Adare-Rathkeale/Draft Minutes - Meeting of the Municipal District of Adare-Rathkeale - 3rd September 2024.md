**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**11.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor G. Ward**

**the Estuary boil water notice that Uisce Éireann immediately provide each household**

**impacted by the boil water notice a grant of €500 towards the cost of installation of a**

**water filtration and purification system. The provision of a new system in each house to**

**include ultraviolet technology would help household costs and improve the drinking**

**water quality.**

**It would also prevent a reoccurrence in the future and people would have peace of mind**

**and reassurance of safe drinking water in 2024.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ward, seconded by Councillor Teskey and agreed.

In proposing the Motion Councillor Ward stated each household affected by the boil water

notice will have no confidence in drinking water quality and proposed a grant be provided

to assist households to install water filtration and purification systems in their own homes.

Councillor O’Donoghue advised this matter was queried previously with Uisce Éireann and

Members had been advised that the filtration system would not remove bacteria from

their water supply.

**12.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor G. Ward**

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Adare-Rathkeale Municipal District calls on the**

**Minister for Further and Higher Education to support the application by the University**

**of Limerick and immediately establish a new Veterinary School in Limerick in order to**

**address the chronic shortage of college places for students wishing to study veterinary**

**and avoid them having to go abroad to study and to ensure that we have enough vets**

**going forward to ensure our food security, animal welfare and support our farmers.**

**group water scheme to ask for an update in relation to consumers having continuous**

**problems with their supply of water.**

In proposing the Motion Councillor Teskey agreed to forward the contact details for the

secretary of the group to the Meetings Administrator.

**14.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting that a full breakdown of costs borne by Limerick City**

**and County Council from the recent court case in relation the Adare-Rathkeale District**

**following the local elections be provided. This breakdown to include and specify any**

**expenditure to any third party.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Hartigan

and agreed.

**Reply:**

By way of background an unsuccessful candidate in the Adare – Rathkeale

Local Electoral Area obtained a Court Order under Article 93 of the Local

Elections Regulations to inspect invalid ballot papers.

Following the inspection, I can advise that the Applicant in the

proceedings made an application to the Court to withdraw their petition.

Limerick City and County Council did not oppose that application.

The Applicant made no application for costs and Limerick City and County

Council did not seek costs against the applicant.

The withdrawal of the application and discontinuation of proceedings is a

positive outcome for Limerick City and County Council. A continuation of

proceedings and hearing of evidence in the Circuit Court would likely

amount to a costly undertaking.

The petitioner acknowledged that the Returning Officer dealt with their

concerns regarding the integrity of the vote in an open and transparent

manner. It was acknowledged by the Judge in this matter that it was

important for democracy that Elections be open and transparent and that

the system was shown to be open, transparent and robust.

In line with standard fees LCCC anticipates paying legal costs of €10,000

plus VAT. No payment has been made at this stage.

**15.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue**

**I will move at the next Meeting that a plan for verge trimming on a year round basis be**

**implemented by Limerick City and County Council on all roads under the control of the**

**Local Authority.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Hartigan

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion Councillor O’Donoghue stated a budget is needed to cover the

huge cost implications for maintaining all road verges. He further requested his Motion---
8

be forwarded to Corporate Services with a view to it being forwarded for the Agenda of

the next Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee.

**Reply:**

Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 places responsibility for the

maintenance of roadside hedges on the owners/occupiers of the adjoining

lands.

The responsibility for the maintenance of roadside verges rest with the

local authority.

Generally, given the extensive road network and funding issues, it is

Council Policy that cutting verges has a low priority compared with other

road maintenance elements. Where work is carried out, priority is given to

sight-lines at junctions or obstruction to road signs. Drainage works are

carried out to verges also as required.

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

operating normally and they continue to co-operate fully with Inland Fisheries

Ireland, Environmental Protection Agency and the Limerick City and County

Council Environmental Department. They also assured the community there has

been no impact on the quality of drinking water.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely
| will ask at next Meeting when was the most recent tenants handbook published,

what changes were made and were all Council tenants given a handbook as well as
being made aware of the changes.

Question submitted by Councillor O. O'Sullivan

| will ask at the next Meeting for an update on my Motion from January 2022 calling
for the creation of 2 Local Food and Catering Sustainable Purchasing Policy for this

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanian

Iwill move at the next Meeting that we request the Minister for Justice to immediately
review the Fee Structure that presently applies to the adaptation of Irish
Naturalisation.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale —
Councillors K. Sheahan (Proposer), B. Collins, S. Keary, E. O’Brien, J.
O’Donoghue, A. Teskey

We will move at the next Meeting if a recipient of carers allowance is living with elderly
parents who are in receipt of the old age pension, their carers allowance adds to the
rent of the social house they are living in. We believe that this should be addressed
by the Elected Members and the extra charge on the rent account that is now incurred
should be removed as we consider this to be unfair and unjust.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

! will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the Minister for Social
Protection asking her to explain why Community Welfare Officers are not available in
clinics at Intreo Offices.

M d ncillor

| will move at the next Meeting that the tenant handbook be amended to reflect that
the tenant is not responsible for the boundary wall or fence of a Council property
where there is no fault on the tenant.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Ryan

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the
Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath, T.D., and the Government, to allow taxpayers
one week where no tax is paid, in line with Social Welfare recipients whereby their
welfare payments increase at Christmas; and, if agreed, that the Motion be circulated
to all Local Authorities.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O'Donoghue

! will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the relevant Government
Departments for the establishment of a fund for the rehabilitation of our older
housing estates. This fund to be used for the upgrade of footpaths and open spaces
and to include extra parking spaces if required. This funding is required for the safety
of every person living in, working or visiting these estates.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

! will move at the next Meeting, given current guidelines and planning appears
inconsistent with the WHO recommended noise limits, and it is my understanding that
Limerick City and County Council has received complaints of sleep deprivation from
wind farm neighbours, that this Council write to the Minister for the Environment,
Climate and Communications to seek advice on what actions or remedies can be made
available to the neighbours of existing wind farms.

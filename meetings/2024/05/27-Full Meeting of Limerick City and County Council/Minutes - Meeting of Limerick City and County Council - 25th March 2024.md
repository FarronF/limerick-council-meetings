11.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will ask at the next Meeting (a) how many septic tank inspections were carried out by this**

**Authority in 2023; (b) the number of those deemed inadequate and requiring remedial**

**works; (c) the amount of grant-aid called for; and (d) how much was paid out.**

**REPLY:**

In 2023, Limerick conducted inspections on 24 No. Domestic Wastewater

Treatment Systems (DWWTS), comprising of 18 initial assessments and 6

follow-up inspections for verification purposes. This fell short of the targeted

level for 2023 due to loss of trained personnel. However, we anticipate a

significant increase in inspections for 2024;

Out of the 18 new inspections, 10 (55.55%) led to the issuance of an advisory

notice mandating remedial actions. The identified non-compliances

encompassed a spectrum of issues including failed DWWTS, desludging,

network repairs, and improper disposal of grey water;

In 2023, Limerick City and County received a total of 8 grant applications, each

with a maximum cap of €5,000 per application;

A total of €40,000 was paid out by Limerick City and County Council under the

Housing (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems Grant under the National

Inspection Plan) Regulations, 2012 (S.I. 223 of 2012) in 2023.

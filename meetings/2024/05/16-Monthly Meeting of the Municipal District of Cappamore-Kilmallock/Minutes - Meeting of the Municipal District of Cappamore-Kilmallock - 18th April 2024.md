7.Discussion item on Bank of Ireland Building, Bruff

An Cathaoirleach wished to acknowledge the investment report regarding investment by

Limerick City and County Council in Bruff, and the work undertaken by the Town Centre First

Officer to date. It was confirmed that Limerick City and County Council have spent €3.2

million in the town of Bruff since 2019, in a Municipal District which spans a large

geographical area.

The following questions were received from Bruff Community:

1. Is there a firm commitment from the Cappamore Kilmallock MD that the former

Bank of Ireland Building in Bruff will not be put up for sale?

2. Can the meeting re-confirm that the former Bank of Ireland Building in Bruff will be

repurposed for Community use?

3. Can you ascertain the current status of the plan to deliver the former Bank of Ireland

building to Bruff as a community hub?

4. Please ascertain the ongoing management of the former Bank of Ireland building in

Bruff by the Property and Community facilities section of LCCC to secure the stability,

maintenance and repair of this heritage building pending repurpose for community

use?

5. As LCCC has granted planning permission for the development of 74 houses in Bruff

to Ballygrennan Homes Ltd, a considerable development contribution is requested in

respect of the proposed childcare facility which the community so urgently needs

now and which will be even more vital when young parents begin to occupy this

development.

The following response was provided:

The former Bank of Ireland building was acquired by Limerick City and County Council in

2021/2022. There was a proposal submitted to development the building as an E Hub

through Town and Village renewal funding. Exploration of the extent of works required and

viability of the proposal was undertaken. Viability of any proposal is key.

It was noted by the Town Centre First Officer that since 2021 there have been a number of

impacts on the viability of the suggested proposal including Covid 19, the National

Broadband plan and the return to the workplace post covid.

Limerick City and County Council continue to explore options for the building, and have

advised that the viability of the end use is what will determine the most appropriate

options.

The Elected Members were advised that the Bank of Ireland Building is not for sale. Should

it ever be determined that sale of the building is the most appropriate option, in

consultation with the community, the sale would have to go to the open market and be

brought in front of the Elected Members at both Municipal District and Full Council.
---
The Elected Members were advised that the funding received under Town and Village

renewal has a requirement to be used as applied for towards the development of an E-hub,

and therefore if an alternative option is agreed upon alternative funding will need to be

sourced. The Town and Village renewal funding is still with the department and it may be

possible to request a change of use.

The Town Centre First Officer advised that Development Contribution funding cannot be

directed towards the childcare facility as all funding under this budget was adopted in 2022.

An Cathaoirleach suggested that a sub committee, including representatives from Bruff

Community and Limerick City and County Council, be established to undertake a feasibility

study on the potential use of the building and it was agreed that this would be appropriate.

It was agreed that a partnership approach should be undertaken.

It was confirmed that the responsibility of maintenance of the building currently lies with

Limerick City and County Council.

8.Deputation by Ballyhoura Development Ltd

The Chief Executive Officer of Ballyhoura Development, Padraig Casey, delivered a

presentation to the Elected Members on the work and governance of Ballyhoura

Development.

An invitation was extended to the Elected Members to an event on the 9th May in Deebert

House Hotel supporting young people to understand democracy.

Mr Casey advised that he would be open to a more regular interaction, e.g. once every 6 to

12 months.

The Cathaoirleach wished to acknowledge the work of the East Limerick Community

Response team and their engagement in Bruff.

Mr Casey advised that there are Kilmallock and Bruff Community Plans in place which are to

be updated in due course. Bruff also has a Public realm plan in place.

The Elected Members thanked Mr Casey for his presentation.

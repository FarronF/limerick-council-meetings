**Item 3: Housing** **–** **Digital Transformations**

Ms. Miriam Donnelly, Administrative Officer, Housing gave a presentation on “Digital

Transformations”

The presentation was well received by the committee.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Sean Hartigan welcomed any I.T. system that improves efficiency and

asked, will it be used for planned or response maintenance when the issue arises and surveying all

council houses for issues and is there a cost for implementing this system and where does the

money come from.

Ms. Miriam Donnelly replied that there is a licencing cost, there is also an element of training for any

new system. Ms Donnelly reiterated that it’s clear that that systems have to be very user friendly.

Mr. Brendan Kidney, Senior Engineer added, a stock survey of all the Council’s stock is being

undertaken which will identify the various issues. It will record an expected lifetime frame on

approximately 6,000 LCCC houses and it will take approximately two years to complete. In the long

term it will make things more efficient.

Cllr. Sarah Kiely added the I.T. system is a welcome addition and asked about windows and doors

upgrades and how will it schedule what happens and will priority be given to people in older

properties, is there a grading system going to be applied for the backlog and are regeneration areas

going to be dealt with.

Mr. Kidney replied regarding the information at present on iHouse, this survey should help it.

Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) have looked at other counties and it has been very effective.

Older housing estates will be looked at first and Regeneration properties will also be included and in

the stock survey.

Cllr. Sharon Benson asked, is this an application for engineers to carry out a physical inspection and

input the details. In reply Ms. Donnelly answered, yes correct and details are recorded in real time.

Cllr. Conor Sheahan welcomed the new system and asked, are LCCC going to come back to the SPC

members regularly to report on the performance especially in terms of the aging property stock and

how long it’s taking to action and see where the short comes may be in terms or going back to the

department.

Mr. Kidney responded that he could come back to the October SPC to provide an update on how

things are going. The system is been rolled out nationally and rollout commenced in the last few

months. He indicated how a survey of gas boilers in the city had commenced and this already was

showing the state of the issues arising and what challenges are ahead.

Cllr. Stephen Keary added that the BER rating should also be carried out as part of the initial survey

of those houses and queried the cost planning for the future.

Mr. Kidney answered that LCCC are in the process of tendering the stock condition survey at the

moment.

**Item 4: Defective Concrete Block Schemes**

Mr Sean Nash, Executive Engineer, Housing gave a presentation on “Defective Concrete Block

Schemes”.

The presentation was well received by the committee.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Keary asked, 1) if a house is condemned and is going to be demolished,

when the contractor is appointed, will there be stage payments to the owner 2) Regarding the

valuation, are the Department the final assessors, as in what is validation process, what is it based

on, is it the reports accordingly 3) Does the Homeowner have to wait until fully approved before it

engages with a contractor 4) Regarding full demolition, does the house have to be re-built in the

same footprint.

Mr. Nash responded as follows: 1) yes stage payments are built into the scheme, when work is done

a claim can be submitted. 2) It would be a mixture, of reports and the Housing Agency would send

out their own technical staff. If the initial application demonstrates there is enough damage done to

the property, it would be accepted into the scheme, and the Housing Agency would be arranging

coring and testing at a later date. Possibly 6-month time frame from coring and results coming back

at this stage. 3) yes, would be advised to wait until approval. 4) Yes, the house has to be built in the

same outer look and layout.

Mr. PJ O’Grady, sectorial representative asked if total re-build is needed, is the onus on the owners

to get contractor. In reply, Mr. Nash, stated the applicant would have to organise consulting

engineer and their own contactor.

Cllr. Keary, enquired regarding associated costs outside of construction, is everything reimbursed

and what about the cost of oversight. In reply, Mr. Nash further clarified that the applicant would

have to pay upfront, and this is reclaimable. The works in relation to coring and other inspections is

covered by the Housing Agency. Mr. Nash also added that the cost of oversight is included in the

grant.

Cllr. Tom Collopy, asked re. physicality, if the inner wall is damaged, that it may not require

replacing. Mr. Nash replied that they see from other counties the outer walls show damage first,

then the inner walls start giving trouble, depends on what the Housing Agency decide. Samples are

taken from inner walls and outer walls and rising walls to see what is taking most of the damage.

Cllr. Keary asked in the case of partial reconstruction, it may be difficult to access the costing and is

there an allowance for contingency. Mr. Nash responded with that replacing a gable wall, it is based

on the area of the wall itself, there are different rates and everything should be included by one

rate.

**Item 5: Housing Delivery Action Plan** **–** **Progress to Date**

Ms. Sarah Newell, Senior Executive Officer, Housing Support Services gave a presentation on

“Housing Delivery Action Plan”.

The presentation was well received by the committee.

A discussion took place. Cllr. Kiely wanted flagged 1) acquisitions, tenant in situ Notice to Quit (NTQ

programme and finding a bit of a gap and delay on confirmation 2) being referred to the Homeless

Action Team within a week and the need to look at this as a Housing Authority 3) an update on the

Land Development Authority (LDA), how many planning permissions, where are we in relation to the

Metropolitan area and looking at LCCC developing Guinness site or with an Approved Housing Body

(AHB).

Ms. Newell in reply 1) If a housing issue comes to any elected member, alert the Housing Strategy

team immediately, the process comes into effect straightaway, there is a deadline date on NTQ’s,

but there is an administration inspection stage which takes 4 weeks, LCCC are trying to work with

landlords if the date passes the NTQ expiry date. There is a large case load at present, 3-4 weeks for

the process to offer a price to the landlord. 2) Ms. Newell replied, can look at that internally and

touch base. 3). Regarding the LDA, is Ms Newell advised she is not aware of an AHB for the

Guinness site. She further advised that LCCC are working with the LDA and will have update

regarding Careys road site in the near future. She indicated that going to planning process next year

for the overall Colbert Quarter masterplan was being examined.

Cllr. Joe Leddin queried whether the figures as presented included Affordable Housing numbers for

Mungret site and indicated that he considered there to be major issues with LDA delivery.

**Cllr. Leddin Formally proposed that LDA be invited to present at SPC to get detailed breakdown**

**per site and timeframe.**

**Proposed:** Cllr Joe Leddin

**Seconded:** Cllr. Tom Collopy

Cllr. Benson queried the most recent report on housing delivery and the indicated shortfall of 1100

Cllr. Benson, also wanted to express the frustration re. LDA. She enquired whether LDA figures are

included in the figures.

Ms. Newell in reply indicated in terms of LDA that LCCC are counting 81 units in The Mills, Castletroy

as cost rental and counting the Guinness site as 270 units cost rental in partnership with the LDA.

She indicated that this may change depending on design team. Ms Newell went on to clarify, in

terms of the approved pipeline figures in today’s presentation that these are the figures as given in

the quarterly updates to Districts. Todays figures also included projects in the pipeline and this

explains the increase. She went on to state that there is a limited amount of land banks owned by

the Council. We are looking to buy land., but majority of social housing is private land via turnkeys

or with the AHB sector. Target 60% New build by LCCC and 40% New build with private land/private

developers.

Cllr. Sheehan was in agreement with Cllr. Leddin in relation to the LDA. Ms. Newell in reply added

that the issue between the LDA and the ESB was between them. LCCC have interaction on the

Guinness site as LCCC own the land.

Cllr. Keary added that since the inception of the LDA no houses have been built in Limerick. Cllr.

Keary asked re. Different houses in different locations around the county and stated he would have

reservations in some of the areas as there is limited infrastructure and utilities in these areas. There

is also a huge figure for Newcastle West which is at capacity. Have LCCC all the assessments done

with Uisce Éireann that x number of houses can be built at these locations, is there sufficient water

and sewer supply there and is there capacity for example in Croom.

Ms. Newell replied there is a connection agreement for Croom site for affordable housing. In terms

of settlements with wastewater capacity LCCC have looked to buy existing connections, new builds

will not work in certain settlements so there is a particular focus on buying existing houses.

Ms. Caroline Curley, Director of Service, added that LCCC are not responsible for Uisce Éireann.

Regarding the Housing Delivery Action Plan, LCCC work with the targets as given by the DHLGH and it

is based on applications for housing. The Plan was drawn up and was discussed and approved by

members. She advised that circumstances change over time depending on infrastructure. LCCC can

only plan what we know about and move forward.

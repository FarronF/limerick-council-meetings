At the outset of the Meeting, on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan, seconded by

patience during the adjournment. Councillor Teskey made reference to the March

apologised to Councillor Collins and Councillor O’Donoghue for comments made at that

Meeting. He referred to the Councillors Code of Conduct and advised he would carry

out his duty as Cathaoirleach here to fore with due diligence and in line with the

Councillors Code of Conduct and Standing Orders.

Councillor Collins thanked Councillor Teskey and accepted his apology adding the role of

Cathaoirleach is to implement the Standing Orders and Councillors Code of Conduct,

which had been lacking at the last Meeting. Councillor Collins in accepting Councillor

Teskey’s apology hoped their conversation around the Standing orders and Code of

Conduct would make future Meetings more productive.

Councillor O’Donoghue also thanked and accepted Councillor Teskey’s apology and

adding the bringing of the Motion had not been done lightly and he hoped going

forward Meetings would be conducted in accordance with Standing Orders and the

Councillors Code of Conduct. Councillor O’Donoghue subsequently withdrew his Notice

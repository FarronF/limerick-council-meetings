Planning, Environment and Place-Making Directorate.

To receive Presentation on the key principles and timelines for the

preparation of the Limerick Draft Noise Action Plans 2024-2028.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Senior Executive Scientist, Environment and Climate Action

to the Meeting.

The Senior Executive Scientist addressed the Meeting and referred to the Environmental

Noise Directive and to twenty per cent of the EU population who are exposed to excessive

noise. He outlined the impacts of environmental noise in Europe including high annoyance,

high sleep disturbance, premature mortality and cognitive impairment in children.

He referred to the Environmental Noise Regulations, 2006 as amended where Local

Authorities are required to prepare strategic noise maps and noise action plans every five

years. He stated that strategic noise maps for major roads are to be produced (>3 million

vehicles passengers per year) in County Limerick and all roads, rail and industrial IPPC licensed

sites selected by the EPA for the Limerick Agglomeration for Lden (>55 dB) and Lnight (>50

dB).

He made reference to the two Noise Actions Plans (Agglomeration and County) which are to

be completed for Limerick. He stated that Transport Infrastructure Ireland have carried out

an assessment of the population exposed to noise and the harmful effects based on the

strategic noise mapping. Based on that assessment, the following actions are proposed:

**(a)Reduce -** Identification of areas for noise mitigation based on noise mapping and the

harmful effects assessment to reduce environmental noise where exposure levels affect

human health.

**(b)Prevent** - Avoid additional members of the population being exposed to the harmful

effects of noise.

**(c)Protect** - Identify potential Candidate Quiet Areas for an application for designation.

The Senior Executive Scientist gave an outline of the proposed timeframes for completion of

the Draft Noise Action Plans (Agglomeration and County) which includes public consultation

by the end of March 2024. It is anticipated that the Final Noise Action Plans (Agglomeration

and County) will be submitted to the EPA by the 18th July 2024 and the Summary of the Noise

Action Plans to be reported to the European Commission by the EPF before the 18th January

2025.

The Members thanked the Senior Executive Scientist and a brief discussion followed on a

number of matters including ways to reduce noise, the impact of surface material used on

roads to reduce noise in residential areas, speed ramps and what measures can be taken to

reduce the effect of noise from traffic on nearby dwelling houses.

Transportation and Mobility Directorate

To Discuss Public Lighting Maintenance in the District.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Senior Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing to the

Meeting.

The Senior Engineer gave a comprehensive update to the Members and stated that Limerick

City and County Council manages and maintains 24,000 lights within Limerick City and County.

He outlined to the Members the different categories of faults which include faults requiring

the installation of interfaces, faults requiring civil works and other general faults. He stated

that on the 1st March, 2024, there were 333 noted faults within the network and that of the

333 faults, 130 faults require the attendance of the ESB in order to facilitate the installation

of interfaces and also to comply with safety standards, 24 faults require civil works and the

remaining 179 faults are general faults. He stated that due to the installation of an interface

being required on a number of faults this is taking longer for the faults to be repaired. The

Senior Engineer reassured the Members that the Council is working closely with the ESB who

have facilitated the Council as much as possible and he also made reference to an improved

reactivity time which has been achieved from the ESB.

He stated that there were 498 faults logged in February 2024 and the vast majority of these

faults were dealt with relatively quickly within a two week timeframe as an interface was not

required. The Senior Engineer also referred to a lot of the network which is quite old and

which needs to be brought up to a safe standard.

The Senior Engineer stated that the Council will continue to work with the ESB to improve the

efficiency of certain fault issues and to get these faults repaired in a timely manner.

A lengthy discussion took place and the Members referred to a number of matters including

the number and location of faults in the Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale areas, length of time

taken to repair faults and owner of the infrastructure. The Members also acknowledged the

work of the relevant staff on this matter.

Following discussion, the Senior Engineer agreed to give regular updates to the Members on

this matter. The Director also made reference to communication with members of the public

on this matter.

QUESTIONS

Meeting and the Questions were therefore taken as having been dealt with.

7.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***for an update on the footpath from Templeglantine GAA field***

***to Dore’s Cross back to the Devon Inn Hotel and safety measures at the junction.***

REPLY:

A feasibility study was carried out on the provision of a pedestrian walkway along the N21

linking the existing pedestrian facilities to Dore’s Cross. This feasibility study was sent to TII

in August 2023 for approval and to allow the scheme to progress to preliminary design. We

are still awaiting confirmation from TII to allow progression of this design and any associated

applications for funding. We will continue to follow up on this scheme and provide an update

once available.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the footpath extension and traffic calming***

***towards Dalton’s Cross**,*** ***Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

TII are not in a position to confirm funding for this scheme at the moment. However, they
---
6

have flagged that there may be an opportunity in the coming weeks for LA’s to apply for

funding to advance the feasibility assessments for schemes that will address severance on

National Roads. TII have committed to alerting us if and when that funding call commences

as planned. If this scheme meets the requirements set out in that funding call we will look to

submit for consideration.

Note there is no guarantee of funding, and any application will be assessed against all others

to establish a priority against any available grant.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting that a drain be installed at the loading bay outside Bar-One***

***bookmakers, Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

This project will form part of the Traffic Management Plan that is due to

commence in June 2024.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will ask at the next Meeting (a) when road junction lining will be undertaken at**

**Coolygorman, Cooliska, Highmount, Gardenfield, Rathcahill and Rathina crosses, (b) that a**

**continuous white line be provided at Feohanagh Village.**

REPLY:

**(a)**Road markings are weather dependent and it is envisaged that these junctions will be

lined during April/May 2024.

**(b)**I believe this is a straight section of road within the speed limit and a solid white line will

be placed during April/May 2024. Note persons can cross the solid white line to enter

residences or businesses.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting when footpath reconstruction works will be carried out***

***between The Goal Post and the Community Hall at Tournafulla.***

REPLY:

The concentration in 2024 for Tournafulla Village will be the upgrade of the main road

between the Church and the GAA field. In order to strengthen the road additional

reinforcement will have to be made to sub grade which will be quite expensive. We may not

be in a position to upgrade the footpaths in 2024 due to lack of financial resources.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** **(*a) How many purchasers with mortgage approval do we have***

***in respect of the initial 21 homes on offer within DC Manor, (b) When can we expect the first***

***of these properties occupied, (c) How many responses have we received in respect of the***

***second phase offer, (d) How many right sizers will be provided for the 10 step down***

***Bungalow Units and when will these be occupied.***

REPLY:

(a)

Having a mortgage approval in principle is not an eligibility requirement to apply for

an affordable purchase scheme and therefore LCCC engages with applicants to advise

them of the requirement to demonstrate their ability to finance the purchase of an

affordable home. As the usual method of demonstrating ability to finance is via a

mortgage approval in principle, the developer has appointed a mortgage broker for

the scheme to assist applicants in obtaining mortgage approval in principle. The

contact details of this broker are provided to all applicants of the Woodfield Manor

affordable purchase scheme and applicants are advised that this service is free of

charge to them. Applicants are also advised of the availability of the Local Authority

Home Loan. Of the 48 applications received for Phase 1, 7 letters of offer have been

issued to date to applicants who were deemed eligible and were in a position to

provide evidence of their ability to finance the purchase. Applications and requests for

further information, including ability to finance the purchase, continue to be

requested and processed and sufficient time will be given to those applicants who

have engaged with a lender or broker in order to obtain mortgage approval in

principle.

(b)

The first of these properties are expected to be occupied in Q2 2024 when the

conveyancing process is complete.

(c)

The second phase of the scheme opened for applications at 12:00 on the 19th

February 2024. The total number of applications received for Phase 2 will be

determined at the end of the application process on the 15th March 2024.

(d)

There are 8 bungalow units. 2 units have been allocated as private rightsizing units.

The Housing Allocations team have allocated 6 further units as social housing elderly

units, and these units will be managed by Clann Housing. Connections are being

undertaken week ending 23rd February 2024 after which the units will be allocated

very shortly.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council put a programme for***

***speed limits in place for our towns and villages in the District with particular emphasis on***

***our schools where pedestrian activity is highest.***

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council have started a review of all speed limits within the city and

county however we are cognizant of the fact that new guidelines for managing and setting

speed limits in Ireland is due to be published in the second half of 2024. Limerick City and

County Council foresee changes to the guidelines in relation to towns and villages and it is at

that time we will be in a position to make any recommendations for revisions to speed limits

within these areas.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that Councillors and Candidates will adhere to a***

***voluntary poster ban in the Municipal District of Newcastle West for the upcoming Local***

***Elections in June.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

In accordance with Section 19 of the Litter Pollution Act posters may be erected for 30 days

before Local Election polling day or from the date the polling day order for the election has

been made, whichever provides the shorter period of time. Election posters and cable ties

must be removed within 7 days of polling day.

In addition under the Electoral Acts posters may not be displayed within 50 metres of a polling

station. This restriction takes effect 30 minutes before the official commencement of polling

and lasts until 30 minutes after the polls have closed. Contravention of this requirement can

result in a prison sentence of up to 2 years.

Election posters must not cause disruption to pedestrians or other road users. The Road

Traffic Acts contain requirements in relation to maintaining clear lines of sight for road users

which may impact on where posters can be placed, e.g. not on road signs, at traffic junctions

or on motorways or roundabouts where they may cause road safety risks. It is an offence to

erect any sign or notice that makes a traffic sign less visible to road users.

These are the current regulations with regard to election posters. It is open to members of

the Newcastle West Municipal District to voluntarily agree not to erect election posters in the
---
10

area in the run up to the Local Government Elections in June, however this agreement would

not restrict new candidates in erecting election posters.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins asked if the Members of the Newcastle West

Municipal District in the interest of the environment and financial cost would adhere to a

voluntary poster ban for the Local Elections in June 2024. He stated that other candidates

should be encouraged to adhere to this ban also. Following a brief discussion, all the

Members concurred with Councillor Collins and it was agreed that a voluntary poster ban for

the Local Elections in June would take place.

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Collins

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will look at installing***

***speed ramps in the villages of Ashford and Raheenagh in the interest of safety to***

***pedestrians and school children.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The provision of ramps or any other form of traffic calming will form part of

the Traffic Calming Policy which will be put before the Full Council on the 25th

March.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins referred to a number of requests for speed ramps

in the District and to traffic speeding through the villages of Ashford and Raheenagh.

20. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council realign the bridge at***

***the entrance to Costello Aluminium in Kilfergus, Glin due to the high volume of accidents***

***that occur there.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

The Bridge Rehabilitation Scheme which is awarded annually to LCCC is approximately €800k

and that allocation is for the maintenance of bridges throughout the County. It will not be

possible to realign this bridge based on the current budget and needs. An alternative that

may be considered, would be to put a Traffic Management Plan on both approaches to the

bridge.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan referred to various accidents which have

occurred at the above location and wished to amend the Notice of Motion to read “I will move

at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council realign the traffic movement at the
---
11

bridge at the entrance to Costello Aluminium in Kilfergus, Glin, due to the high volume of

accidents that occur there”.

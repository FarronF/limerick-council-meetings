questions/comments.

Cllr. E. O’Donovan raised three observations/queries as follows:

1. Why is a plebiscite required when every residential estate needs traffic calming measures.

2. Horizontal

deflection

is

a

very

positive

measure

and

works

well

in

Ballinacurra/Shelbourne Road. She would like to see it used on Henry Street and asked if

a plebiscite would be required in this instance.

3. She agrees the policy is effective but the execution by Operations and Communications is

inadequate. She referred to the recent bollards on Ashbourne Avenue/S.C.R. which are

not placed where speed could be reduced.

Cllr. Secas agreed there should be aplebiscite to ascertain if and where a speed traffic calming

measure is required, but she disagrees with holding a traffic survey after a plebiscite. Residents

should be consulted when conducting a survey regarding the timing and location.

In response to Cllr. O’ Donovan, Mr. McGrath confirmed a plebiscite is required and can be

conducted by the Resident’s Association. He also confirmed that the new speed limits are coming

into effect Friday 16th February 2024. Mr. O Reilly will investigate the bollards recently erected

at Ashbourne Avenue/S.C.R.

In reply to Cllr. Secas, Mr. McGrath stated it is preferable to ascertain what type of traffic calming

measure is required before a plebiscite is undertaken, so that residents understand the measures

that they are being asked to approve of.

Cllr. Teefy raised the following queries: -

1. If rural areas and schools are being considered for traffic calming measures, how would a

plebiscite be completed as it can be difficult to conduct in the county.

2. Can traffic calming be introduced on a cul de sac which currently has an 80km/h speed

limit or does it have to be less that 50km/h. She added that current traffic calming

measures on local/regional roads and cul de sacs are effective but need to be maintained

due to wear and tear to make them compliant.

Cllr. Teefy requested the presentation to be circulated to members.

Cllr. J. Leddin asked if traffic calming measures should be a condition of planning applications in

new residential estates. He also referenced a recent survey undertaken at Roundwood Estate

which he felt was undertaken at the incorrect location and incorrect time. The Young Munster

club, located in the estate is in favour of traffic calming measures at entrance to club.

He also enquired if the new speed limit reduction of 50kp/h would apply on the Ballinacurra

Road.---

Cllr. Butler stated that much work goes into a plebiscite and asked if using Section 38 would be

more efficient.

In response to questions, Mr. McGrath confirmed that traffic calming is included in the planning

process for larger housing estates. He added that the Ballinacurra Road like the Dock Road

cannot be reduced from 50km/h due to its classification. This is a strategic route and will be busier

with Bus connects.

Regarding Roundwood Estate, he advised looking at a specific concern and if a survey is required,

he advised requesting that the survey be completed over a duration. If there are issues, then it is

incumbent on the Council to deal with the matter. He offered Cllr. Leddin an opportunity to

discuss with him separately or Mr. O’Reilly to close out the issue.

In relation to using Section 38, Mr. McGrath stated that S38 doesn’t prescribe carrying out a

survey. Residents requiring traffic calming measure should get signatures, therefore the initial

stage is to do a survey.

In response to Cllr. Teefy, he advised that some schools are on strategic routes but there is no

reason why traffic calming measures cannot be put in place especially if aligned with Safe Routes

to School. Mr. O’Reilly advised that there are various speed zones around rural schools. These

can be reduced from 80km/h down to 50km/h or 50km/h down to 30km/h through speed limit

appeals process.

Mr. McGrath also added that a plebiscite is not required on rural roads as they are not residential

locations. He added that it is rare that ramps would be placed on rural roads due to the lack of

public lighting and would be a safety issue.

The current policy is to build speed limit around the core city centre. An example of a logical

corridor would be from the Shannon Bridge approaching Barrington Street and the Crescent. He

added that it is not appropriate to set land speed limits in an ad hoc manner. Most housing

estates are done under Jake’s Law

The chair welcomed the move away from speed ramps to traffic calming measures. She

referenced the Netherlands where intuitively one slows down due to different types of road

material.

Cllr. Secas asked if the 3D international best practice visual effects like in the NTP had been

considered. In reply, Mr. McGrath advised that all options will be considered and added that the

3D option was a temporary measure and he felt it would lose effectiveness over time.

The next step in the Traffic Calming Measures Policy is to consider the views expressed today,

and subject to further comments, to finalise the policy wording and recommend that it goes to

the Full Council for adoption.---

**Item 3: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan (referred from Metro Meeting)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and

County Council consider the introduction of a multi-location Parking Permit for certain approved

organisations operating within the City Centre area, so as to enable them to park their vehicle at

various locations throughout the city in order to deliver essential and important services to

people in the City Centre area.

In proposing the Motion, Cllr. Hartigan said this motion arose from an issue where The

Samaritans, while not linked to a residential address park their vehicles legally and strategically

to maximize their services and recently they have attracted parking fines. He wished to consider

other organisations in his motion. A residential permit will not suffice.

Cllr. Hartigan proposed deleting the word ‘**consider’** from his motion and replacing it with the

word ‘**introduce’**. He wished to make a recommendation to the full council and welcome the

members' support.

The chair seconded the motion.

Mr. McGrath read the response as follows:

***Parking permits are currently issued to residents in accordance with existing parking bye-laws***

***on an annual basis (for a nominal fee) based on provision of detailed documentation. The***

***current parking bye-laws do not provide for issuing of any other permits or exemptions to***

***parking fees in the paid parking zones.***

***However, the current approach to parking management, the charging mechanisms and a***

***review of parking demand management are to be examined under the Limerick City Transport***

***Plan. Consultants have now been appointed by the NTA to prepare this plan for review by***

***Quarter 3 2024. In reviewing the approach to parking management the consultants will be***

***asked to assess the possibility of making special provisions for parking exemptions and to***

***review the current permit system.***

Cllr. Hartigan expressed his thanks for the response and considered his motion passed. Mr.

Kennedy advised that the Notice of Motion should be submitted as a recommendation to Full

Council and the response from Full Council will determine that way this matter will be managed.

Cllr. Teefy complemented all involved in the recent ‘Think before your Park campaign’.

Ms. Browne expressed her disappointment that there was no acknowledgement of the voluntary

group’s contribution in the campaign Video. The Chair noted her thanks from this SPC to the

voluntary group.

The Chair thanked all for their contribution and confirmed that the next Travel & Transportation

SPC Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, the 16th of April 2024. This concluded the business of the

meeting.---

NOTICES OF MOTION DEFERRED FROM JANUARY

MEETING

10.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that Limerick

City and County Council seek to purchase land with a view to making serviced sites available

to potential first time buyers in the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District to showcase

the future housing potential of this type of development as an example.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council continues to deliver on its programme to activate vacant

homes and derelict sites throughout the city and county with the aim of bringing neglected

properties back into productive use.

Utilising legislation such as the Derelict Sites Act 1990, acquired properties made available by

the Council for sale to new owners on the private market can benefit from the Vacant

Property Refurbishment Grant.

The Rural, Community and Culture Development Directorate are exploring all options to

activate sites for purchase by First Time Buyers, subject to availability of funding through

Government. This will also require internal discussion with relevant departments in Planning,

Housing, and the Property Management Department.

**Proposed: Councillor Donegan**

**Seconded: Councillor Egan**---
NOTICES OF MOTION

11.Proposed rescindment of Notice of Motion submitted

by Councillor Carey - January 2023

I will move at the next Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District meeting that this local

authority engage with Iarnrod Eireann to discuss the possibility of leasing the Kilmallock

Railway Station with a view to subletting to the local branch of the Red Cross following

recent communication received.

**REPLY:**

If the motion as submitted is proposed and seconded at the Municipal District Meeting,

Limerick City and County Council will correspond with the Minister for Transport on the

request to prepare a feasibility report on the re-opening of Kilmallock Station.

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

12.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District meeting that

this local authority contact Iarnrod Eireann to request that Iarnrod Eireann lease the Railway

Station, Kilmallock, to LCCC, who will in turn sub lease to the Red Cross

**REPLY:**

The Municipal District Office will liaise with Property and Community Facilities to determine

the formal procedures required to assist in the delivery of this motion. It should be noted in

the event that Kilmallock Railway Station is leased to the Irish Red Cross, Limerick City and

County Council will not be in a position to provide any budgetary support for any

improvement works that may be required at the property. It should also be noted that any

costs that would be incurred in organising a lease such as legal fees, etc. would be borne by

the Irish Red Cross.

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

**It was noted that this Notice of Motion was subhect to the overarching right of Iarnrod**

**Eireann to reopen the Railway station, and that interest had been expressed in the**

**property by other parties also.**

13.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Donegan---
I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District

calling on Limerick City and County Council to complete a review of the footpaths,

road signage and public lighting in Ballyorgan village.

**REPLY:**

The Municipal District Office has previously reviewed footpath infrastructure in

Ballyorgan. It was identified that 900m of new footpath including drainage works is

required and 300m of existing footpaths need replacement. The estimated cost of

these works is approximately €400,000. Unfortunately, there are no budgets

available at present to deliver this infrastructure. However, it should be noted that

the Municipal District office will continue to liaise with the Limerick Active Travel

Office to secure funding in the future through the NTA Active travel Programme.

With respect to the existing signage and possible need for additional signs, The

Municipal District Office will carry out a survey in the village and identify any

deficiencies that may exist.

The Public Lighting in the village will be replaced to LED lighting through the Regional

Public Lighting Energy Efficiency Project which is currently underway across Munster.

If however, any issues are identified locally on the existing lighting infrastructure,

these can be reported and the existing Operations and Maintenance contractor

(Enerveo) will carry out the necessary repairs. Faults can be reported at

www.deadsure.ie , https://enerveo.com/report-a-fault/republic-of-ireland/ or by

phone at 0818 372 772

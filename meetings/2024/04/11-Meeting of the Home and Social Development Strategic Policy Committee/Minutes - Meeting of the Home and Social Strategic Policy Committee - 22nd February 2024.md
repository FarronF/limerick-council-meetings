An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary asked how concrete was used for the Clonlong Group Housing

Development. Ms. Phillips highlighted that Traveller Accommodation is very complex and that

emergency planning was sought in this instance due to exceptional circumstances. Ms. Phillips

stated that Traveller Accommodation is not generic housing and that we have learnt from previous

experiences.

An Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Stephen Keary enquired about planning permission for the site at Coonagh

and is not easy. Cllr. Sheehan highlighted that as a local authority we have a very good track record

in this area.

unfit for purpose and that only 1 or 2 families remain at this site. Ms. Phillips highlighted that there

Cllr. Slattery stated that field adjacent to traveller accommodation on the Old Cork Road is full of

rubbish and that illegal dumping is ongoing at this location for years. Cllr. Slattery also stated that a

colleague had raised the issue of horses on the road. Cllr. Slattery suggested that Limerick City and

County Council relocate the tenant in the house and purchase the land adjacent to it. Ms. Phillips

advised that this is a generic house and that illegal dumping falls under the remit of the Environment

unit and that in tandem with the Community Sustainment unit and Housing they continue to

monitor the area and address issues.

Cllr. Joe Leddin highlighted that there are several caravans illegal parked again at Alandale and that

there is a burnt-out car at this location similar to the same issues experienced in Coonagh. Cllr.

Leddin asked why the families won’t go into serviced sites. Ms. Phillips stated that they have

engaged with the families and made offers of accommodation. Ms. Phillips stated that the Traveller

Accommodation Unit works very closely with Planning Enforcement and that the matter will have to

go through the Court System.

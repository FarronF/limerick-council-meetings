10.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***that a Low Cost Safety Scheme be applied for Reens Pike***

***junction, this should include signage, road markings and most importantly public lighting.***

REPLY:

Under TII’s National Road Delineation Renewal Programme, RPS has been appointed to design

a new road marking scheme for the entire N21 route. They are planning on being on site this

year and this will include a review of Reens Pike. We have contacted TII/RPS to request and

update on this program and have also brought your specific request to their attention.

Limerick City and County Council have previously explored providing lighting at similar T-

junctions on the national road network. As this does not meet the requirements for Lit

Junctions as per DN-LHT-03038 a departure would be required.

For junctions of this type to be lit there are a number of criteria that must be considered. TII

have a method of evaluating applications with items such as accident history, the number of

houses in the vicinity and physical activity facilities.

Given that, there does not appear to be a history of night-time collisions at this location, based

on the information available to TII and that there does not appear to be other justification for

lighting in a rural area it has been advised that any departure application would likely be

rejected. With this in mind, we are unfortunately not in a position to provide lighting at this

location.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting that a stop sign and road markings be installed in The***

***Orchard housing estate, Abbeyfeale.***

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council engage immediately***

***with Uisce Éireann to enter discussions with Glin Development Association with regard to***

***compulsory acquisition of land at Killacolla, Glin, Co. Limerick.***

REPLY:

Uisce Éireann is progressing plans to end the discharge of untreated sewage from Glin, Co.

Limerick, to the Shannon Estuary. This important project involves the construction of a new

wastewater treatment plant and sewerage infrastructure including a pumping station and---
6

sewer pipelines. These essential works will ensure compliance with national and EU

regulations relating to the treatment of wastewater in Glin.

Uisce Éireann will continue to proactively engage with local stakeholders as we work to

deliver this essential project.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next Meeting what contract have we in place with Enerveo Ireland for the***

***provision of public lighting services in Limerick City and County, when does the contract***

***lapse and what are the KPI’s on the services provided.***

REPLY:

The maintenance arm of Enerveo will be ceasing activity from the 24th of July 2024.

Currently there is a tender competition ongoing, the results of which will be made known to

the Members when complete and we are examining options for emergency cover to bridge

the gap between contractors.

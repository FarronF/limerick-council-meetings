The Príomh Chomhairleoir welcomed everyone to the meeting and noted that the meeting

was called to consider the amendment of the Schedule of Ordinary Meetings to meet

legislative requirements of Section 31 (3) of the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) and

Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2024.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir outlined that the Mayor is required to present a draft of his

Mayoral Programme for consideration by the Elected Council at an ordinary meeting and

therefore, he is asking Members to consider the proposed amendment as follows:-

“That Ordinary Meetings of the Council shall be held on the 26th August 2024 and

also bi monthly on the fourth Monday of the months of September, November,

January, March, May and July and that the Order of Business for the Meeting of the

26th August 2024 include the Mayoral Programme as the sole Agenda Item”

Some Members view was that Workshops should be held with each of the Municipal

Districts and the Metropolitan District to agree and prioritise items to be included in the---
**2**

Mayoral Programme, while others were in agreement to amend the Schedule of Ordinary

Meetings to allow the Mayor present his Draft Mayoral Programme.

Following discussions, it was proposed by Councillor Slattery and seconded by Councillor

Ryan (E) to amendment the Schedule of Ordinary Meetings to meet legislative requirements

of Section 31 (3) of the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) and Miscellaneous Provisions

Act, 2024.

This concluded the Meeting.

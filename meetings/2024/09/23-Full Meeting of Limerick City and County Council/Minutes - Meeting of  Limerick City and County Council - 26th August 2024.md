VOTE OF SYMPATHY

The Príomh Chomhairleoir welcomed everyone to the meeting, and at the outset, and with

the agreement of all the Members, a Vote of Sympathy was extended to the family of the late

Denis McCarthy, Corbally, who had passed away following a brief illness.

Members noted that he was originally from Broadford and later lived in Corbally, and was

elected in Limerick City East at the 2009 Local Elections. His dedication and leadership were

quickly recognized, leading to his election as Deputy Mayor at the first meeting of the old City

Council.

Denis’s career was marked by his passion for public service. Before his election, he worked

at the Department of Agriculture, where his love for farming was evident. His deep

connection to his roots in West Limerick was a testament to his character, as he frequently

visited his beloved Broadford.

Denis was a thorough gentleman who represented his constituents with great enthusiasm

and his dedication to his community was unwavering. He took his duties seriously, always

preparing meticulously for events and ensuring he represented the council with insight and

grace. One of Denis’s significant contributions during his tenure was his focus on

regeneration areas. He was deeply committed to improving facilities and amenities in these

areas, working tirelessly to fulfil his promises.

The Members expressed their condolences to his sons Donogh and Colum, daughter Ann

Marie, partner Marion, daughters-in-law Jane and Kate, grandchildren Conor, Lucy, Liam,

Sean, Aidan, Cathal, Darragh, and Aisling, former wife Ann, and his extended family.

The Meeting was adjourned for 15 minutes as a mark of respect.

On the resumption of the Meeting, the Príomh Chomhairleoir noted that the Mayor is

required to present a draft of his Mayoral Programme for consideration by the Elected

Council to meet legislative requirements as set out in the Local Government (Mayor of

Limerick) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2024.

The Mayor gave a presentation to the Members on his draft Mayoral Programme which he

described as an ambitious programme for Limerick that would benefit both City and County.

He outlined to the Members the importance of finalising the proposed Mayoral Programme

as soon as possible, so as to allow time for engagement with Ministers and various

Government Departments in the run up to Budget 2025, in order to maximise all possible

opportunities for Limerick.

He outlined the process in drafting his Mayoral Programme through engagement with local

communities, meetings of the Advisory Committee, discussions with Director of Services and

relevant staff, and through the proposals received from Elected Members of the

Metropolitan and Municipal Districts. The Mayor believed that the Programme gives a very

strong direction of where Limerick is going, pointing out it is a plan to progress Limerick City

and County further, across a range of areas, and he needed support from the Elected

Members in delivering his Programme for the betterment of all the people of Limerick.

He believed there was a willingness from Government to interact with Limerick, following

the Local and Mayoral Elections in June, and he needed the Elected Members to also

support him in delivering his Programme for the betterment of all the people of Limerick.

He outlined to the Members how his proposed Draft Mayoral Programme gives a very

strong direction of where Limerick is going; pointing out it is a plan to progress Limerick

further, across a range of areas.

The Mayor confirmed that timelines were tight, having regard to the statutory deadlines set

out in the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2024,

which required that the Mayoral Programme be adopted within 4 months of the Local

Elections, i.e. early October 2024.

Members thanked the Mayor for his presentation and welcomed a plan to progress Limerick

further. However, some Members raised concerns around the timeline to draft this

programme and encouraged the Mayor to meet with the Members of the Districts to agree

priorities for each area. Some Members emphasised the importance of addressing issues in

the City and County in a balanced way so that all of Limerick would be improved where

possible. It was also the view of some Members that some of the proposed plans in the Draft

Mayoral Programme were outside the role of the local authority, while other Members

welcomed many of the proposals contained within the draft programme.

Some Members were of the view that not enough consultation had taken place in relation

to the draft Mayoral Programme, and believed that additional discussions and Workshops

between the Mayor’s Office and the Metropolitan & Municipal Districts were needed.

Members also referred to the lack of projected expenditure costings for what was being

proposed, and also why some suggestions and proposals that had been submitted by the

Metropolitan & Municipal Districts had not been included in the Mayoral Programme.

Some Members believed that the Mayoral Programme should proceed and that the

Programme could be amended and modified over time, in response to what funding was

available to progress the various proposals. With the national Budget 2025 also imminent,

they believed time was of the essence to proceed.

The Mayor acknowledged the feedback received from Members, and stated he had

complied with the legislation and he asked that the Members proceed with the Mayoral

Programme to allow him to continue his engagement at a local and national level.

Some Members were of the view that the Meeting should be deferred, whilst others

believed a deferral should not take place. Following further discussions, Cllr Slattery,

seconded by Cllr B. Collins, formally proposed that the Meeting be adjourned.

The Príomh Chomhairleoir asked that a vote take place on the proposal and the result of the

voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillors Butler, Collins (B), Conway, Doyle, Foley, Galvin, Keary, Kiely, Kilcoyne,

Talukder, Teskey, Ward. (21)

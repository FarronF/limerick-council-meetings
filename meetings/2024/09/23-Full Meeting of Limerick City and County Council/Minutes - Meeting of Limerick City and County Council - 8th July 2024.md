Chief Executive’s Report

Circulated, Chief Executive’s Report for the month of May 2024.

The Report was noted by the Council.

(b)

Standing Orders – Limerick City and County Council

Circulated, report of the Meetings Administrator dated 3rd July, 2024, enclosing a

proposed revision of Standing Orders giving effect to the changes in structure and the

operation of meetings in order to align with the Local Government (Mayor of Limerick) and

Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2024.

The changes reflected the role of the Príomh Chomhairleoir as Chair of the Meeting

and provided for the Elected Members to submit Questions to the Mayor of Limerick for oral

answer during Plenary Meetings. A resolution of the Council was required should Members

wish to adopt the revised Standing Orders.

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon, it was

agreed to defer this item pending the holding of a Workshop.

(c)

Mayoral Programme

Mayor John Moran gave a PowerPoint presentation on the draft Mayoral Programme.

He advised the Elected Members that he had a statutory obligation to prepare and publish

his Mayoral Programme within 4 months from his commencement date.

He highlighted that finalising his programme early will give him the opportunity to

bring his plan for Limerick to relevant Ministers, to look for funding and support for this long

term plan for Limerick. He believed there was a willingness from the Government to interact

with Limerick, following the Local and Mayoral Elections in June.

He outlined the process in drafting his Mayoral Programme through engagement with

local communities, meetings of the Advisory Committee, discussions with Director of Services

and relevant staff, and through the proposals received from Elected Members of the

Metropolitan and Municipal Districts. The Mayor believed that the Programme gives a very

strong direction of where Limerick is going pointing out it is a plan to progress Limerick City

and County further, across a range of areas, and he needed support from the Elected

Members in delivering his Programme for the betterment of all the people of Limerick.

Members thanked the Mayor for his presentation and welcomed a plan to progress

Limerick further. However, Members raised concerns around the timeline to draft this

programme and encouraged the Mayor to meet with the Members of the Districts to agree

priorities for each area. Some Members emphasised the importance of addressing issues in

the City and County in a balanced way so that all of Limerick would be improved where

possible. It was also the view of some Members that some of the proposed plans in the Draft

Mayoral Programme were outside the role of the local authority, while other Members

welcomed many of the proposals contained within the draft programme.

In response, the Mayor confirmed that timelines were tight having regard to the

national Budgetary Process and the importance of finalising the proposed Mayoral

Programme as soon as possible to increase the possible funding opportunities for Limerick.

He advised the Members of each District to finalise the priorities for their areas, for possible

consideration in the Draft Mayoral Programme.

The position was noted by the Members.

Circulated, report of the Mayor of Limerick, John Moran, dated 24th June, 2024,

attaching the updated Limerick City and County Council Traffic Calming Policy 2024 (dated

April 2024). It was recommended that the Council adopt the Policy.

The A/Director, Transportation and Mobility, gave a PowerPoint presentation to the

Members outlining the objectives of the Traffic Calming Policy 2024 as follows:---
9

 Improve safety on our roads;

 Improve driver awareness of vulnerable road users;

 Improve comfort and accessibility for public transport, cyclists and pedestrians;

 Reduce noise, disturbance and anxiety.

He advised Members that the current Traffic Calming Policy 2018 needed to be reviewed

due to limitations in the scope of the policy. He confirmed that the existing policy does not

apply to all roads and pointed out that this was one aspect under review, along with the

existing assessment criteria, availability of funding and to ensure consideration is given on

guidelines to facilitate public transport.

The following amendment to Section 7.1 of the Traffic Calming Policy 2024 was

proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan (O):

“Any such request, for residential areas, must be accompanied by a plebiscite of residents

in which two thirds of all the residents on the street affected have indicated that they are in

favour of the proposed measures. Alternatively, evidence of a site notice should be submitted

to the Engineer. Details of the site notice are outlined below.

 Housing Estates - Limerick City & County Council or applicants can, in place of the

Plebiscite, install site notices either side of each entrance of the housing

estate. Site notices shall also be installed at the proposed location of traffic

calming measures notifying residents of the proposed scheme and location.

 Through Road - Limerick City & County Council can, in place of the Plebiscite, install

site notices at the proposed location of traffic calming measures notifying

residents of the proposed scheme and location.

Plebiscites/Site notices are only required for physical traffic calming measures (vertical or

horizontal deflection traffic calming measures) which will alter the road alignment. Site

notices shall remain in place for a period of three weeks and evidence of the site notice in

place each week should be submitted to the Local Authority.”

On the proposal of Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan (O), the

circulated report of the Mayor of Limerick, John Moran, dated 24th June, 2024, attaching the

updated Limerick City and County Council Traffic Calming Policy 2024 (dated April 2024) was

adopted subject to the above amendment.

**Suspension of Standing Order 4:** The Príomh Chomhairleoir drew attention to the time which

was approaching 5.30 p.m. and on the proposed of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by

Councillor Slattery, Standing Order No. 4 was suspended in order to complete the agenda.---

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

I will ask at the next Meeting of Limerick City and County Council if this Council can enforce

developers to open crèches in new residential developments when people are now living in

estates but childcare facilities have not opened.

**REPLY:**

The responsibility to ensure that planning permissions, including the attached

conditions, are complied with and implemented in accordance with the

permission rests with the applicant/developer. Where it comes to the

attention of the Planning Authority that there is non-compliance with a

permission or unauthorised development, including failing to construct a

crèche that formed part of a permission, the Planning Authority initiates an

investigation in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and

Development Act 2000 (as amended).

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

I will ask at the next Meeting (a) the number of affordable homes delivered by our Authority

in 2022, 2023 and 2024 to date, and (b) the number of Local Authority Mortgage Loans that

were provided in each case.

**REPLY:**

(a) The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage issued formal

Affordable Housing targets to the Council on 30th March, 2022. The Council

spent 2022 recruiting an Affordable Housing Team and launching campaigns

seeking advance purchase turnkeys from private developers/builders to

deliver affordable homes. Therefore, no affordable homes were delivered in

2022. Limerick City and County Council delivered 46 affordable homes in 2023.

A further 50 affordable homes will be delivered by the end of 2024. In addition

to the above Local Authority-led schemes, the Approved Housing Body Sector

and the Land Development Agency delivered 38 affordable homes in 2023. A

further 116 affordable homes will be delivered by the end of 2024. The pipeline

is increasing month on month as developers and builders begin to understand

the range of Government subventions available for the delivery of affordable

homes.---
13

(b) 95% of successful and eligible affordable housing applicants obtained

mortgage approvals from Commercial Banks for affordable home purchase.

One household to date required the Local Authority Home Loan and their

application was approved in principle. The mortgage will be drawn down once

legal work is completed.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

I will ask at the next Meeting as to the number of hours spent by field workers updating the

Electoral Register in Limerick over the 53 months from December 2019.

**REPLY:**

In 2019, Limerick City and County Council carried out an assessment on the

continuation of the use of fieldworkers. The global pandemic in early 2020

superseded the decision on the use of fieldworkers as the country experienced

a number of periods of lockdown whereby any interaction outside of the home

was discouraged in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Since that time,

the Electoral Reform Act, 2022, has been enacted and a number of other

measures have been in use to update the electoral register, including the

onboarding of checktheregister.ie which facilitates electors to update and

change their information online on a continuous basis. Further developments

are being undertaken on a national basis, led by the Department of Housing,

to move to a centralised system and work will continue to cleanse data held

on the current register. The phasing out of fieldworkers aligns with the

approach taken in Kerry County Council, Tipperary County Council, Clare

County Council, Cork City Council and all Dublin Councils.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

In relation to the Night-time Economy Survey, I will ask at the next Meeting is the online

survey the only research that Limerick City and County Council will carry out in relation to the

city centre in terms of economy and quality of life.

**REPLY**:

The online survey is only one of a range of methods used to ensure extensive

consultation and a data driven approach is used in the development of a Night

Time Economy Action Plan (pursuant to the requirements of the NTE pilot).

The following methods of research and consultation are planned over the

next three months, with an Action Plan expected to be finalised and launched

by early November:

 An external consultant has been engaged to assist with data

gathering/local research, survey development and analysis,

and facilitation of stakeholder engagement. Research and

data collection/analysis is underway and will be presented

together with survey outcomes in due course. There is no

specific NTE data sets, however this will be built from

relevant data from a variety of publicly available sources.---
14

 Two online surveys were launched on 25 June 2024 (a business

survey and a public perception survey), with a closing date of 17 July

 Development of stakeholder relationships (representing various

cohorts), pursuant with the required objectives of the pilot have

commenced (i.e. Youth, Students, Older People, Safety, Hospitality

including Hoteliers & Vintners, Venues, Active Cities, City Centre

Business Owners, Tourism Sector incl. Failte Ireland & Creative

Ireland). Internal networks have also been established with the NTE

Advisor attending the Gateway Forum, the Market Quarter Working

Group and various other projects as required. These internal and

external networks will continue to evolve throughout the pilot.

 Night-Time Audits will take place (dates not yet confirmed), with

specific cohorts (this may include, but is not limited to, Youth,

Multicultural community, Women’s groups, Residents, LGBTQI

community). The audits will incorporate a night walk in the city centre

at a specific time, followed by a focus group discussion. Local

Councillors will be invited to attend these.

 A Stakeholder Workshop will be held in September 2024, to explore

the data collection/analysis and survey results, consider existing and

emerging challenges and opportunities, discuss strategies and

brainstorm ideas. The meeting outputs will be collated and a report

subsequently prepared for consideration of the NTE Advisory

Committee (to be established thereafter).

 A series of six thematic/targeted roundtable-style meetings to be

held with ‘Subject Matter Experts’ (approx. six to eight

representatives at each meeting). Themes will be adopted according

to outputs and identification of key priorities from both the surveys

and the Stakeholder Workshop.

 A NTE Advisory Committee will be established, which the Mayor has

indicated he will chair – the Committee will consider and provide

feedback on the Action Plan framework. The Committee will be

formed on the basis of individual’s acceptance of responsibility for

various actions and recommendations. The Committee will meet

quarterly to review and monitor implementation of the Action Plan

and consider any alterations if required.

15.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

I will ask at the next Meeting of Limerick Council for an update on the use of chemical

pesticides by Council staff and Council contractors.---
15

**REPLY:**

Plant Protection Products (PPP), Herbicides and Pesticides are used on a

limited basis by Limerick City and County Council. At all times, only EU-

approved licensed Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are used. Council

Operatives are trained in the correct application procedures. Any use of

products containing glyphosate is subject to the appropriate risk assessment

and compliance with safety requirements in relation to their use and

application. Limerick City and County Council is committed to reducing its use

of PPP across the organisation.

The Parks and Recreation Section of the Council is leading the way with PPP

use, having been phased out over the last few years. Parks staff or contractors

working on the Council’s behalf are not permitted to use PPP in any parks or

recreation areas. Alternative methods such as strimming are employed.

The Cleansing Section of Limerick City and County Council employs a

contractor to treat weeds on public footpaths and roads throughout Limerick

City. The Contractor has carried out a risk assessment, which evaluated

alternative treatments to chemicals. The risk assessment concluded that the

use of the most suitable plant protection product (PPP) applied at the

appropriate rate, under the correct conditions, by qualified operatives, was

necessary. Three overall applications take place each year, one in April/May,

another in July and a final application in September/October, all dependent on

weather conditions. The Council’s contractor uses a compact tractor mounted

sprayer using photosynthetic detectors and operated by registered

professional users. This system can target individual weeds without blanket

spraying a surface, this ensures that chemical treatment is only applied where

plant life is present and minimises usage of chemical pesticides.

Encouragement of biodiversity, including the growth of wildflowers and the

promotion of initiatives like “No Mow May,” emphasise the importance of

minimising the use of PPP. Roadside margins are now becoming better

managed for pollinators; more Council-owned amenities and recreational

areas are being managed for biodiversity. Limerick City and County Council is

a committed Council partner to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan, and Council

Action 19 states that Councils reduce or eliminate pesticide use so as to help

pollinators.

“Guidance for Local Authorities to ensure compliance with the Sustainable Use

of Pesticides Directive,” issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the

Marine, has been circulated to relevant staff so as to ensure compliance with

said Directive.

In relation to Invasive Alien Plants, the use of PPP is also limited and only used

where necessary. In the Loobagh Hogweed removal programme, plants are

removed manually with pesticide use only employed in inaccessible areas or

extreme infestations. However, PPP is essential for the control of Japanese

Knotweed and must be retained as an option.---

The combination of measures outlined above will have the overall impact of

reducing the dependency on, and usage of, pesticides.

NOTICES OF MOTION

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir, the Motions on the agenda were

taken in the following order:

18.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council allow for live streaming of all Council***

***Meetings deemed open to the public.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan and seconded by Councillor

Hickey-O'Mara.

Councillor Sheahan (J) proposed that the Motion be deferred pending the outcome of

the LGMA sector-wide review of live streaming of Council Meetings. This was seconded by

Councillor Slattery.

The following Reply was read:

**REPLY:**

Live-streaming (or ‘webcasting’) of meetings involves live or ‘real time’ audio

or video streaming of a meeting’s proceedings over the web so that the

meeting can be viewed or listened to remotely. In addition, a record of the

meeting may also be made available after the event if decided to make

meeting records available on playback.

At present, Council meetings are open to members of the public through the

public viewing gallery in the Chamber or through Microsoft Teams.

**Key Issues:**

Drawing on the experience of those local authorities that currently use

webcasting and those that have examined its feasibility, there are a number of

positive benefits highlighted. These include:

Greater openness and transparency – live streaming Council Meetings gives

the public the ability to have accurate and immediate viewing of meetings or

to use the playback facility; this helps to improve public trust in Local

Government;

Promotes public understanding – live streaming meetings supports

understanding of how the Council works and how and why decisions are taken;

Encourage engagement – live streaming promotes engagement with young

people using mobile technology. Further the webcasting service can include a---
17

feedback page/survey that allows stakeholders to provide information and to

better interact on the type of further information they require;

Raises profile of Councillors – live streaming meetings will afford Councillors

better ‘reach’ into their respective constituencies and so the opportunity to

raise their profiles given the accessibility of live streamed meetings for

constituents. However the following issues need to be considered in the

context of live stream meetings.

**Costs/Viewership**

A similar notice of motion was raised by Councillor O’Donovan in the past and

at that time a number of local authorities had invested in live streaming

meetings however it was apparent that viewership was quite low and as such

would not support a cost benefit analysis of streaming. Since that time Limerick

has made meetings accessible via Microsoft Teams, however the viewership

and interest in joining meetings online via Microsoft Teams in Limerick City and

County Council has rarely exceeded five members of the public.

Online streaming may place a constraint on Councillors – live streamed

meetings are more public by their nature and so opinions that may otherwise

have been expressed in a Council Chamber may not be expressed in a live-

streamed meeting. Some Members may feel constrained in the manner in

which they operate.

Publishing Defamatory Statements and the potential for vicarious liability for

statements made contrary to law. Elected Members do not have the

equivalent protection of TDs in the Dáil and may find themselves subject to an

action in defamation. Equally Members or staff may inadvertently disclose

confidential or privileged material. Other local authorities who live stream

have been involved in litigation in recent years as a result of their recordings.

Consideration should also be given to the Criminal Justice (Incitement to

Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill. This will criminalise both

intentional and reckless communication or behaviour likely to incite violence

against a person or persons because they are associated with a protected

characteristic. The legislation has been drafted to ensure it captures online

communication and a person shall be regarded as communicating material to

the public or a section of the public if the person displays, publishes, distributes

or disseminates the material, shows or plays the material, or makes the

material available in any other way. You may recall comments made in the

chamber in Limerick City and County Council on an emotive topic led to a

number of complaints to the Gardai and a subsequent investigation.

**Data Protection**

Live streaming and recording would involve the processing of personal data of

those attending meetings whose can be seen and heard as well as any---
18

individual whose personal data is disclosed. In light of the processing of

personal data involved, there are a number of factors to be considered

including the legal basis for the recording, as well as compliance with principles

such as data minimisation, transparency, purpose limitation and storage

limitation. Limerick City and County Council must demonstrate a legal basis to

process personal data in addition to complying with the principles of data

protection. Any processing should meet the requirement of being necessary,

proportionate and justified and it would be necessary to complete a data

protection impact assessment.

Grandstanding live streaming of meetings could lead to “grandstanding”.

There can be a tendency for speakers to exceed their allotted time to maximise

exposure when Meetings are live streamed, particularly with regard to

contentious issues.

Hacking/Editing of Content webcasts can potentially be open to hacking and

being edited or manipulated by third parties. Such editing can misrepresent a

Member if then broadcast on social media.

**Recommendation:**

Having considered the issues as outlined, weighing up the risks against the

benefits it appears that on balance neither the cost nor viewership justifies

introducing live streaming at this stage. Council meetings are currently

managed in an open and transparent manner with the notice of meetings and

agenda published online in advance of meetings, the public and press ability

to attend and report on meetings in addition to the minutes of meetings

published online. Should the members resolve to live stream this would entail

a change to standing orders.

Following some discussion, the Príomh Chomhairleoir declared that a vote be taken

on the proposal to defer the Motion and the result of the voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillors Beasley, Butler, Collins (B), Conway, Daly, Doyle, Galvin, Hartigan (T), Keary,

Kiely, Kilcoyne, Leddin, McSweeney, O’Donoghue, O’Sullivan (O), O’Sullivan (T), Pond,

O’Donovan, Ryan (E), Secas. **(10)**

**Abstentions**

**(0)**---

***contact with the Minister for the Environment to get the D Maps for offshore wind published***

***immediately so that Foynes Port can put plans in place to develop its infrastructure in***

***advance of what is planned in the Mid-West for renewable energy.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor

Collins (B).

The Mayor confirmed that he has made contact with the Minister for the Environment

to get the D Maps for offshore wind published and he agreed that a formal response is

required. He discussed the views of the Council with the Minister and acknowledged it was

extremely important to progress this matter.

26.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Collins

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Mayor and relevant officials of Limerick City and**

**County Council update the Members on what measures have been taken to date on the**

**following Commitment from the Mayor’s “Pillar 3-Policy Plan for a More Healthy Limerick”-**

**: (Quote) “If elected, I shall get straight onto the issue of boil notices in our county and the**

**solutions needed to sort these out and have a report weekly to the people impacted about**

**progress and a plan to sort this out.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Collins (B) and seconded by Councillor Keary.

The Mayor acknowledged the concerns of the people of Limerick currently living in

areas under a boil notice and the difficulties they are experiencing. He outlined how he has

raised the water issues with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and

the Mayor outlined his plan to keep Members and the people of Limerick up to date on the

progress of the matter. The Mayor also urged Members to continue to raise this issue with

their party Ministers.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Department of Housing, Local***

***Government and Heritage to make a grant available to dispose of Asbestos from the roofs***

***of dwelling houses.***

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

***I will move at the next Meeting that we, as a Council, write to the Minister for Justice and***

***ask that the law be changed for victims of violent assault.***

The Motion was amended to include ‘all’ victims of violent assault and was adopted

by the Council, on the proposal of Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Collins (B).

20.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Beasley

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council will work with the***

***ISPCA to deliver a much needed Inspector to Limerick.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Beasley and seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan.

**REPLY:**

The ISPCA provided an Inspector in Limerick for five years between 2015 and 2020.

Unfortunately, due to difficulties in funding and working conditions, the ISPCA took

the decision to stop providing an Inspector in Limerick at that time.

ISPCA Inspectors are authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare

Act 2013 (AHWA) and have powers to enter land, seize animals (if an offence

has been committed) and issue enforceable Welfare Notices. An Garda

Síochána also has these powers.

21.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council immediately review the current guidelines**

**around the control of dogs and increase the number of dog wardens currently employed in**

**Limerick, if necessary, in order to combat the current spate of loose and uncontrolled dogs**

**roaming our streets.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan and seconded by Councillor Benson.

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council is obliged to follow S.I. No. 442/1998 –

Control of Dogs Act 1986, Regulations, 1998, as amended, and is aware that

the Department is currently reviewing these Regulations in light of recent

events. The number of dog wardens has not been identified as a contributory

factor to the current situation.

Members welcomed this Motion and agreed it was an important issue that needed to

be addressed. In response, the A/Director of Support Services advised the Members that

once the Department have completed their review of the Regulations, a workshop will be

arranged in due course to discuss the proposed outcomes with the Elected Members.---

22.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that a root-and-branch review be undertaken on our***

***Electoral Registers locally.***

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir and in Councillor Scanlan’s absence,

the Motion was proposed by Councillor Ryan (E). Councillor Teefy seconded the Motion.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council will undertake a project to review and

improve the accuracy of our register of electors and welcome information

from our public representatives to aid this ongoing process. As Elected

Members are aware, the provisions of the Electoral Reform Act, 2022 provide

the legislative underpinning for a range of significant electoral reforms in line

with commitments in the Programme for Government. The legislation

provides for the modernisation of our electoral registration process to deliver

greater accessibility and improved integrity. The Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage’s Electoral Registration Modernisation Project team

lead on reforms and all local authorities are undertaking data cleansing

exercises in advance of moving to a new centralised system while retaining

responsibility for the register at local authority level. All new applications or

updates are subject to a simple identity check step to support ongoing

improvements to the integrity of the register. In order to progress towards a

complete and accurate register an advertising campaign was launched to

support registration authorities in seeking engagement of electors, both new

and existing to check and complete their information with PPSN, Eircodes and

Date of Birth. Prior to these campaigns one in three electors did not have a

date of birth associated with their record. This information assists in identifying

duplicates, ensuring the movement or removal of the correct individual in the

event of death, allowing individuals to identify and edit their own record using

MyGovID.

During the recent electoral events, Limerick City and County Council and all

local authorities received an unprecedented number of applications

particularly in light of multiple advertising campaigns. It was necessary to put

additional resources in place to assist the team. In October 2023 the number

of local government electors was 146,551. In May 2024 the number of electors

increased to 157,672. The Franchise team processed 28,518 actions between

January and May comprising of 13,581 additions, 11,647 modifications and

3,290 deletions. It became apparent that the checktheregister online system

inadvertently caused duplicate applications increasing the workload of the

Franchise team significantly during this time as did the amount of handwritten

paper-based application forms. Limerick City and County Council will work with

the County Registrar, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of

Housing, Local Government and Heritage, An Post and the Elected Members

to improve the accuracy and integrity of the electoral register.---

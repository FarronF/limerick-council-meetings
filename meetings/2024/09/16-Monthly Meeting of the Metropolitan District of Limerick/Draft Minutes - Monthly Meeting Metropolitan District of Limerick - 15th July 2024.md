**QUESTIONS**

**4.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress is being***

***made with the provision of cricket playing facilities.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council’s Regeneration, Sports & Recreation Directorate have

been engaging with the local cricket clubs on the potential to develop cricket batting

infrastructure within Mung ret Park. The Directorate will continue to explore options in

relation to identifying lands that would be suitable for the delivery of such a resource within

the Metropolitan District of Limerick.

**5.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**---
3

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what criteria is used to***

***monitor the city roundabouts that are sponsored by corporate organisations as there is quite a***

***difference in the quality and appearance of these roundabouts.***

**REPLY:** The Council has entered into Service Level Agreements with Corporate bodies who sponsor

the various roundabouts around the city. The Service Level Agreement is for a period of

three years with the option of extending for another three years subject to agreement

between both parties. The design for the individual roundabouts vary and require different

levels of maintenance and have different challenges. All designs must be pollinator friendly

and comply with the All Ireland Pollinator Plan. The sponsorships include a specific

maintenance schedule in the Service Level Agreement and this is monitored by the Council

throughout the year. The Council are reviewing all sponsorships to ensure that all

roundabouts are up to the required standard.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick has an application been***

***submitted to the department for improvement works to the church at Mount St. Laurence.***

**REPLY:** An application has not been submitted to the Department as a Conservation Specialist is

required to advise on the appropriate method of restoration works for the Chapel and costs

associated with same. The Council are in the process of engaging this Conservation

Specialist and once costs and specific works have been identified, an application will be

made to the Department for funding of these works.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress has been made***

***on the installation of Eircodes on playgrounds and public parks under Council control after a***

***commitment was given in the last term of this Council.***

**REPLY:** The Council has reviewed the matter of Eircodes for amenities, including playgrounds and

public parks for emergency contact purposes. From consultation with the National

Ambulance Service, the preferred method of contact and that being used by the National

Ambulance Service is where a member of the public contacts the emergency services, the

Ambulance Service responds by texting back the caller, allowing the location of the caller

to be made known to the Ambulance Service. This is considered to be satisfactory by the

Ambulance Service, there are concerns that an incorrect digit may be stated by the caller

which would hamper an emergency response. It is considered that the current system is

satisfactory and therefore there is no requirement for Eircodes.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can the Council advise when***

***a property is in the Council ownership after the Tenant in Situ Scheme how long is it taking for***

***the Council to go in and refurbish/repair the property and is there funding specifically available***

***for these properties.***---
4

**REPLY:** The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage funds both the acquisition and

the refurbishment of properties under the Tenant in Situ scheme.

Specifically, refurbishment works include essential repairs and safety works to bring a

property up to rental standards as set out in Housing (Standards for Rented Houses)

Regulations 2019.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage expect recoupment claims for

refurbishment works after works have been carried out to be submitted to them within 6

months of the acquisition closing its sale.

It is currently taking Limerick City and County Council an average of 160 days

(approximately 5 months) from close of sale to completion of the refurbishment works.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if Limerick City and County***

***Council can contact the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration & Youth to ask***

***what steps have been taken to inform local residents and traders about the proposed use of River***

***House and the Ballysimon Centre as IPAS refugee centres.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council will write to the Department of Children, Equality,

Disability, Integration & Youth to ask what steps have been taken to inform local residents

and traders about the proposed use of River House, Charlotte Quay and the Ballysimon

Road as accommodation centres.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***proposed development of 5 No. Community Bungalows at Mulcair Drive, Annacotty.***

**REPLY:** The proposed development will be comprised of 6 no. 2 bedroom houses, arranged as 3

no. single storey bungalows in semi-detached formation. The houses have been designed

to Universal Design guidelines to accommodate a range of applicant types including elderly.

The planning application process will commence in the next 3 weeks.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Pond**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on progress***

***for the delivery of the much-needed proposed Library for the greater Castletroy Area.***

**REPLY:** The need for a library in Castletroy has been identified in the current City and County

Council’s 5 year Library Development Plan.

Following the launch of the current plan, two potential sites in Council ownership were

identified directly behind the Castletroy Shopping Centre and adjacent to both primary and

secondary schools.

A facility of this size and range requires significant planning and resources, both capital and

revenue and progress must be set in the context of other local authority demands.---
5

Therefore, we are not in a position at this stage to have a definite timeline for delivery of

this facility.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick about whether a***

***sustainability audit was carried out for Riverfest 2024 and if not could a sustainability audit be***

***carried out on forthcoming festivals beginning with Samhain 2024.***

**REPLY**: A sustainability audit was not undertaken for Riverfest 2024. However, Limerick City and

County Council is currently examining the sustainability of its Civic festivals in line with

LCCC’s Festivals and Events Strategy.

Samhain is an independent festival produced and delivered by Lumen Street Theatre.

Limerick City and County Council makes direct investment in the festival sector through the

annual Festivals and Events scheme. The competitive grant scheme, offers the opportunity

for funding under three Strands.

The three strands of funding are:

S1: Delivery and Programming of Small and Community focused Festivals and Events

S2: Delivery and Programming of Medium and Large Scale Festivals and Events

S3: Festival Development and Sustainability

Strand 3 seeks to fund actions to support the long-term sustainability of Festivals/Events.

This strand aims to support the development of organisational structures such as the

carrying out of feasibility studies; business plan development; reviews of governance

structures; development of new Festival/Event concepts; marketing and audience

development strategies; brand development; clustering initiatives which support

collaboration through shared resources and/or expertise amongst two or more

Festivals/Events. This award is intended to support a step change in the ambition and

delivery of the festival.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if road-widening measures***

***are planned at the Clonmacken Road entrance to Aylesbury as to allow cars to safely enter and***

***exit the estate simultaneously.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City & County Council Roads Department currently have no plans to widen the

internal road entrance to Aylesbury from Clonmacken Road. The widening of an internal

road in a residential area would not be a strategy LCCC would typically contemplate as it

may introduce an opportunity for vehicular speeding to take place. However centre line

road markings will be considered as guidance for road traffic users in this area.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on proposed***

***plans for a Caherdavin playground.***

**REPLY:** Funding of €410,000 has been allocated for a new playground for the Caherdavin

community, consisting of a combination of General Municipal Allocation and Development---
6

Contributions funding. A number of sites have been reviewed and narrowed down. It is the

Council’s intention to hold a consultation with the Caherdavin community on the proposed

playground for Caherdavin. The consultation will be held in early September where the

community will be invited to provide their input and share any possible concerns in relation

to a new playground for Caherdavin.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for detailed information on***

***the ownership Limerick Council has on Loughmore Canal and provide documentation on same.***

**REPLY:** In relation to the question asked by Councillor O’Donovan, the attached letter contains the

information requested.

Letter from Leahy Reidy Solicitors was circulated as part of the reply and states:

I have examined the agreement, maps etc. in relation to the above. The documents go back to the

early 1970’s and the agreement had a specific purpose which was to accommodate surface water

from the then new Raheen Industrial Estate. The solicitor acting at the time for the County Council

was Mr. William Leahy and as you know our firm Leahy Reidy is the successor firm to the old Leahy

& O’Sullivan. It would not be appropriate to share the documents I have viewed as they relate to

an agreement with a considerable number of persons all of whose consent would be required.

By way of background, in the early 1970’s the Council entered into a legally binding agreement

with persons residing in the region of Loughmore Canal. This letter relates only to that part of the

Canal constructed through Loughmore Commons. The agreement involved payment of

compensation and legal costs by the Council and in exchange the parties to the agreement

surrendered their grazing rights in the area of Loughmore Canal and further granted rights

of way for various purposes to the Council its servant and agents, with and without vehicles to

enter lands not acquired by the Council to gain access to the Loughmore Canal.

It is quite clear that all parties were fully aware of the purpose of the Agreement and the parties

surrendering their grazing rights had their own independent legal advisors. Not only did the Council

compensate the parties to the agreement but it also further agreed to do the following:

1. To fence a specified area and to maintain the fence;

2. To provide sluices at the points marked on the map to enable water on Loughmore to be drained

into the trench;

3. To provide a substantial bridge 10 feet wide at a specified point to enable cattle to pass and

repass over the trench.

It is important to understand the content and significance of this agreement given the construction

and importance of Raheen Industrial Estate. Since the date of the Agreement the Council

constructed the Canal, back drains, sluices, bridge, sections of pipeline, fencing and gates and over

fifty years carried out continuous maintenance work on the Canal in conjunction with various other

statutory bodies including SFADCO and the IDA.---
7

We have not been provided with any evidence that any party other than the Council has any

evidence of a legal interest in Loughmore Canal.

The Council’s legal interest has been acquired by agreement with third parties as mentioned above,

the payment of consideration and the construction and maintenance of the Canal for over half a

century. The rights acquired by the Council and its servants and agents are not in our opinion

capable of being successfully challenged by any party.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on extending***

***the 30kmph zone to residential streets in the city centre including St. Joseph’s Street, St.***

***Alphonsus Street, Barrack Hill, Lord Edward Street and Rosbrien Road.***

**REPLY:** As part of the Programme for Government an implementation group was formed to review

and reduce speed limits where appropriate to address both road safety issues and carbon

emissions. As part of this review the following amendments in relation to default speed

limits were proposed and legislation passed to amend the default speed limits as follows:

a) On national secondary roads, from 100km/h to 80km/h

b) On local roads, from 80km/h to 60 km/h

c) On roads in built-up areas from 50km/h to 30km/h

The legislation was amended with respect to the default speed limits on the 12th of April

2024. The Department of Transport have indicated that the Bill will be “commenced” in

phases.

 The first phase is the implementation of the local roads default from the current 80

km/h to 60 km/h.

 The second phase is the implementation of the national secondary roads default from

the current 100km/h to 80km/h and also on roads in built-up areas from the default of

50km/h to 30km/h.

 The third phase will examine particular areas of sensitivity such as schools or locations

where VRUs are the predominant road user.

Phase 1 has commenced with a view of the introduction of the revised speed limits in

November with Phase 2 commencing in the first part of 2025. Any proposed extension of

the 30kph zone will be accessed and managed as part of Phase 2 and implemented in

accordance with the guidelines.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on THM levels***

***in Limerick City water supply and if it’s now compliant with EPA recommendations.***

**REPLY:** The project for resolving the THM issues at Clareville WTP was handed over for

infrastructure delivery in Q3 2023.---
8

The solution requires extensive bench trials and experimental design to study the efficacy

of the following options prior to implementation of a preferred solution: 1. Enhanced

coagulation optimisation 2. Chlorine Dioxide Dosing 3. PAC Dosing 4. Potassium

Permanganate dosing 5. Chloramination. An instruction to commence with the bench trials

was issued to our Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) partners in Q4 2023, with trials

ongoing.

On successful completion of bench trials, the optimum solution will be selected based on

the effectiveness in THM reduction while adhering to other water quality standards. A

preferred solution and timeline will be confirmed in Q4 2024.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor S. Beasley**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many homeless beds***

***have been supplied by Limerick City and County Council over the last 5 years.***

**REPLY:** Please find hereunder a breakdown taken in May each year from 2020 to 2024 of the

number of beds provided to homeless persons for singles adults and families which includes

adults and children in the families.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Beasley**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what is the funding that***

***was given by Central Government for the Travelling Community. How much has been spent and***

***a breakdown of expenditure.***

**REPLY:** There is no set fund provided to Local Authorities by Central Government. Each Local

Authority must apply for funding for projects they wish to undertake as set out in the

Traveller Accommodation Programme. Limerick City & County Council claimed a total of

€9,953,304.11 during the period January 2019 - June 2024. This is made up of

€7,536,271.82 in Capital Expenditure and €2,417,032.29 in Traveller Specific

Accommodation Maintenance for the Limerick Metropolitan Area. Between July 2024 and

December 2024 it is hoped that a capital project of €1.5 million will commence in Rathkeale

and a capital project of €175,000 will be complete in Askeaton. The new Traveller

Accommodation Programme will commence in January 2025.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor S. Beasley**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what was the revenue from***

***dog fines when released back to their owners from Limerick pound over last 2 years.***

**REPLY**: A reclamation fee of €50 is to be paid to reclaim your dog from the Dog Shelter. The fee can

be waived at the Dog Warden’s discretion depending on the circumstances. The issuing of

a fine will depend on whether an offence has been committed under the Control of Dogs

Act.

Over the last 2 years (from July 2022 to June 2024), €1,300 total was paid in reclamation

fees. There were 39 dogs reclaimed from the shelter during this period and 26 owners paid

the fee.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**21.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council increase enforcement of the regulations regarding restricted dog breeds.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Kiely and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan referred to the discussion on the issue at the recent

Full Council Meeting and highlighted the significant difficulties with dangerous dog breeds.

Members supported the Motion and stated that the Bye-Laws should be reviewed also.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council employs two dog wardens, a kennel assistant and

administrative support in operating the LCCC Dog Shelter and in enforcing the Control of---
11

Dogs Act, including regulations regarding restricted dog breeds. The team responds to all

complaints regarding stray dogs, restricted breeds, dog licences, issues fines, and seizes

dogs where it is safe and appropriate to do so. LCCC Dog Wardens work in close

collaboration with Gardaí in relation to enforcement of restricted breeds regulations and

regularly assist in Garda operations where restricted breeds are present.

In May, LCCC in collaboration with local Gardaí launched an awareness campaign that

highlighted the responsibilities of owning a restricted breed and asked the public to

seriously consider before taking one of these dogs into their homes.

Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphries has recently set up a

cross Governmental stakeholder group, to examine issues related to dangerous dogs and

restricted breeds. The Group is made up of representatives from key government

departments and interest groups and will make recommendations on strengthening the

policy and increasing regulations around dog control. Further powers on restricted breeds

may be available to Council staff on foot of these recommendations.

The Administrative Officer, Environment and Climate Action also informed the Members that the

Minister had, in recent days, announced a ban on XL Bully dogs and further details would be

available in the coming weeks.

**22.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council engage***

***with Clancourt Limited, owners of the Crescent Shopping Centre, to discuss the upgrade of the***

***children's playground similar to the recently developed playground in the Peoples Park, that can***

***accommodate children with special needs.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin stated that many families with young children lived in

the Raheen / Dooradoyle area with many new housing developments and a playground with

modern equipment which would be more inclusive was urgently needed.

**REPLY**: The Council will engage with Clancourt Limited to discuss a possible upgrade to the

playground adjacent to the Crescent Shopping Centre in order to accommodate inclusive

play equipment.

It was agreed to arrange a Workshop on the need for playgrounds and to invite the Mayor to attend

same. It was also agreed to include the Play and Recreation Policy for discussion.

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we receive an update***

***on the progress made on the crypt in Mount St. Laurence and the commitment given to improve***

***it and make it safe.***---
12

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Doyle and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kiely highlighted the poor condition of the crypt and the

potential developments and improvement works that could be carried out in the graveyard.

Members also noted the very historic nature of the graveyard and its possible potential as a tourist

site, similar to Glasnevin Cemetery.

**REPLY**: The Council has undertaken the necessary works to make safe the crypt at Mount Saint

Lawrence. The ope has been secured and temporary fencing placed around it until the crypt

can be fully restored. It is the Council’s intention to include the crypt as part of the upgrade

works for the entire Chapel and seek funding for the restoration of the crypt as part of the

application to the Department for the full restoration of the Chapel in Mount Saint

Lawrence.

The Senior Engineer, Environment and Climate Action confirmed that this was a priority but that it

was very difficult to procure conservation architects. He agreed to meet Councillor Kiely on site to

review the situation.

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the process of taking***

***in charge of the lanes in Lynwood Park be commenced so as to transfer same back into the***

***ownership of the Council so that these lanes can be properly secured and managed.***

The Cathaoirleach confirmed that the Notice of Motion was withdrawn by Councillor Slattery.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that TII, the Mid West***

***Road Design Office and Limerick City and County Council engage with the owners of the Crescent***

***Shopping Centre to explore the possibility of an extra entrance / exit from the Crescent Shopping***

***Centre in Dooradoyle, parallel to the railway line and then connected to the N18 Motorway***

***Section, so as to alleviate congestion on the Dooradoyle Road.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kilcoyne highlighted the very high traffic volumes in the areas

of Dooradoyle, Ballinacurra and the Rosbrien Road, as well as the roads surrounding the Crescent

Shopping Centre, particularly in the months leading up the Christmas.

**REPLY**: The provision of an additional junction at the location suggested, would be a matter for the

Crescent Shopping Centre to propose as it would be a dedicated access to a private

development. Any such junction would need to be cognisant of the spatial planning and

national roads, relevant local and national policies and not impact on the capacity and

safety of the existing national road infrastructure. It is noted that this section of the

national road network also forms part of the Limerick Tunnel PPP concession contract.---
13

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Beasley (to be referred to the Home and Social**

**Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council consider including Bin Charges as part of the Rent Structure fees for social housing***

***tenants (unless on a waiver program).***

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Home and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

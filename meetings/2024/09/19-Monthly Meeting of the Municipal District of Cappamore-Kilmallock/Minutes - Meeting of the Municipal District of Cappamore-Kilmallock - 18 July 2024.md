NOTICES OF MOTION

7. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that the

two parking spaces opposite No. 29 Riverview be removed back to the original grass design”

**REPLY:**

The existing car parking spaces which are the subject of Cllr. Carey’s motion are not specific

to one property. They are public spaces to be used for anyone in the estate. In order to

remove them, the majority of residents should indicate in writing that they are in favour of

the proposal.

**Proposed: Councillor Carey**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan**

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O’Sullivan

“ I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that

Limerick City and County Council correspond with Uisce Eireann to seek an update on the

status of the water scheme takeover in Kilglass and the current status of the boil water

notice in place.”

**REPLY:**

I am writing to you today regarding your request for an update on the status of the Water

Scheme takeover in Kilglass and the current status of the Boil Water Notice in place. Your

Uisce Éireann reference number for same was 24317 which was raised on the 08/7/2024.

I wish to advise that the following update has become available; schemes will only be taken

over when fit for purpose and free from significant defects that would impact on customer

service, water quality or asset longevity. The Boil Water Notice in place for the Kilglass

Scheme is a key issue that needs to be addressed prior to the Scheme being Taken in

Charge.

The plan is to connect this supply to the Mitchelstown supply. Design for the connection is

complete and the tendering process is currently underway. A main contractor is expected to

be appointed within 6 weeks with works to be completed by the end of the year, and the

Boil Water Notice is subsequently expected to be lifted. Following this, we expect the Taken
---
in Charge process to progress. Further information will be available in the Rural Water

Department of Limerick County Council.

I trust that this update provides clarity to both you and your constituents. Should you have

any further queries, please don’t hesitate to contact us on the details below. For the latest

supply and services updates, please see: https://www.water.ie/?map=supply-and-service-

updates.

**Proposed: Councillor** **O’Sullivan**

**Seconded: Councillor E Ryan**

QUESTIONS

9. Question submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on my motion from April regarding the possible purchase of five units at Beech Lodge Care

Facility, Bruree or any other alternative options that are being considered for the current

residents.”

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council were made aware of the Notice of terminations served to

5 residents at Beech Lodge Care Facility, Bruree in early April of this year. The Housing

Strategy unit have been trying to make contact with the owner to get their consent to

engage in the Tenant in Situ Acquisition scheme, whereby the Council, subject to certain

conditions, can make an offer to purchase the units to prevent homelessness. The Council

cannot progress under the Tenant in Situ Acquisition scheme until the owner engages and

confirms they are willing to progress through the Tenant in Situ Acquisition Scheme. The

Housing Support Services team are aware of the situation and have been in contact with the

tenants with a view to finding a solution.

Question submitted by Councillor Carey

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on when Castlecourt Estate, Kilmallock will be fully taken in charge by this local authority.”

**REPLY:**

public lighting within the estate. Once this element of works is completed and sign-off from

the area engineer received, the formal process of taking the estate in charge will be initiated.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

“I will ask at the  next Cappamore-Kilmallock MD meeting for an update on the proposed

Traffic Calming measures at the Boskill/ Millennium road in Caherconlish.”

**REPLY:**

During the preparation of the Caherconlish mobility management plan and the proposal for a

new pedestrian bridge across the existing watercourse at the Millenium Centre, the draft

Appropriate Assessment/Environmental Impact Assessment screenings identified a need for

more extensive environmental/ecological surveys, in particular the need for a Natura Impact

Assessment. This requirement requires the council to submit a Section 177AE application to

an Bord Pleanala for the planning of the new bridge. The consultant engaged for the mobility

management plan in Caherconlish is currently working on the additional surveys and the

preparation of the An Bord Pleanala application. Once this stage of the scheme is completed,

the overall scheme will proceed to Part 8 public consultation.

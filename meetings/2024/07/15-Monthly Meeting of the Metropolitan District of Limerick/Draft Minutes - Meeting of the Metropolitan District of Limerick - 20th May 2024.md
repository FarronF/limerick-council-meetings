**5.Update from Land Development Agency**

The Head of Property, Land Development Agency gave a Presentation to Members, which included

an update on the following projects:

 Project Tosaigh, Castletroy-81 homes projected;

 Mungret Housing Scheme-183 homes projected;

 ERVIA, Dock Road-240 homes projected;

 Lower Carey’s Road--255 homes projected;

 St. Joseph’s Hospital Land-600 homes projected.

An overview was also given in relation to projected timelines for the completion of phases for

various projects in the Limerick Metropolitan District Area and also the likely constraints in relation

to certain sites.

Members thanked the Officials for the presentation and made the following points:

 Delivery of houses was too slow in the current housing crisis. Members were seeing people

living in housing conditions that were unacceptable, and the timeline that the Members

wanted, was when keys could be put in the doors of a property, by those badly in need of

housing;

 The development cycle, including the planning process, was taking much too long and should

be shortened;

 Extensive engagement with local residents in relation to the St. Joseph’s site was crucial.

 A full team of staff, based in Limerick, was urgently needed so as to progress developments in

Limerick;

 Lack of transparency and accountability from the Land Development Agency and poor

communication in relation to projects delivery;

 Community facilities and infrastructure must be provided at the same time as housing;

 Local Contractors and construction workers should be prioritised to work on these projects

where possible;

 Homes being provided should be affordable and be a pathway for people towards home

ownership.

The Leas-Cathaoirleach took the Chair as the Cathaoirleach had to leave the Meeting.

**Suspension of Standing Orders**

On the proposal of Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon, Standing Order 4 was

suspended in order to complete the agenda.

**QUESTIONS**

**6.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many ground floor***

***units are currently unoccupied within the core city centre and what level of engagement is taking***

***place with these property owners to repurpose these units.***

**REPLY**: The 2024 City Centre Health Check Survey (February-March 2024), indicates the total vacant

ground floor commercial space in the core retail area to be 16,585sq m (101 units). This

represents 18% of the total eligible ground floor space (i.e. all uses excluding residential and

religious).

There is regular and proactive engagement with the owners, or their agents, of vacant

properties through the Economic Development, Enterprise and Tourism Directorate to

explore investment leads and business development opportunities. The Council also has a

‘Vacant to Vibrant Retail Economic Incentive Scheme’ available towards fit out and costs of

business and retail within the city centre which comprises of grants up to €6,000 to

encourage activation of vacant units.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to consider the sourcing of***

***a mobile swimming pool similar to the one used by Dublin City Council so as to provide an***

***additional recreational amenity for people across the city.***

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council will engage with Dublin City Council in relation to

information on this amenity so that appropriate consideration can then be given to this

matter.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can you advise if areas such***

***as Oakwood, Old Singland Road and Hilltop, St Patricks Road that have limited parking spaces***

***but a lot of green area, can the green area be cut into to make up car parking spaces.***

**REPLY**: Any proposals to reduce green areas to make provision for parking would need to go

through a planning and consultation process.

Green areas and open space are typically considered amenities and a certain amount of

green areas may be required to comply with planning conditions.

Where there is a perceived issue, the matter should be brought to the attention of the

District Engineer to assess the extent of the problem and look at alternatives to resolve the

issues without loss of green areas or amenity areas.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, with the Factory Youthspace***
---
6

***Galvone due to close in December 2024, have the Council made other arrangements to provide***

***youth/sport facilities in the area.***

**REPLY:** The Council has submitted a business case to the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage for the development of a new facility on the Kilmallock Road in

conjunction with Limerick & Clare Education & Training Board and Limerick GAA. No

decision has been made on this submission however the Council will continue to engage

with the Department in this regard.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the list of organisations***

***who have received regeneration funding over the last 5 years from the Social and Economic***

***Intervention Fund, and the amount they have each received.***

**REPLY**: Please find attached a list of the one hundred and thirty-nine organisations that received

Economic and Social Intervention Funding between 2019 and 2023. These are the allocated

grant figures but they may differ from the amount the organisation has received to-date.

This can be attributed to (1) lower activity levels arising out of Covid- 19 and/or (2) the

detailed process of reviewing project documentation prior to final draw down.

**11.Question** **submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a pedestrian crossing to***

***be placed on the Rosbrien Road from Roundwood Estate to Ballinacurra Gardens for the people***

***crossing from Young Munster RFC to the Catholic Institute/Ballinacurra Gaels etc.***

**REPLY**: Active Travel has no budget allocation for a pedestrian crossing at Rosbrien Road from

Roundwood Estate to Ballinacurra Gardens for the people crossing from Young Munster RFC

to the Catholic Institute/Ballinacurra Gaels.

Active Travel will examine the feasibility of creating this crossing as part of a more

comprehensive scheme for Rosbrien Road.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***Council's plans for the old shop on the Mill Road including a timeline for delivery and breakdown***

***of unit.***

**REPLY**: It is proposed to submit a planning application by the end of May 2024. Drawings have now

been completed and we await the results of the EIA and AA Screening reports. On

completion of the planning process, tender drawings will be prepared and a stage 3

application made to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is

hoped that works will commence on site in early 2025. A total of 7 units are proposed, 1

no. 1 Bed and 1 no. 2 Bed houses, 4 no. 1 Bed and 1 no. 2 Bed apartments.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on noise***

***mitigation measures that have been implemented or due to be implemented for residents of***

***Glencairn, Dooradoyle from the M20.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council are working in collaboration with Transport Infrastructure

Ireland (TII) on proposed measures that, while not primarily aimed at reducing noise in the
---
11

Glencairin area, are expected to improve the noise environment for communities living near

the M20 motorway. The measures are:

(1)  TII and the Council to undertake a pavement overlay on the M20 motorway with a new

surface similar to that installed along the M7 between Junctions 28 and 30 in 2023.

(2)  The Council and TII are considering a speed reduction along the M20 from 120kph to

100kph between Junctions 1 and 3 in response to safety and capacity issues. The executive

of the Council is committed to the proposal but it is noted that the setting of speed limits is

a Reserved Function.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update from***

***Transport & Mobility and Planning, Environment & Place-Making on what action is being taken***

***to deal with concerns from residents of Avonmore Road, Dromore Rise, Graney Close, Sullane***

***Crescent, and Norbiton Hill in relation to cars parking in the vicinity of their home whilst visiting***

***or working in UHL.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council carries out regular patrols in this and adjacent areas. So

far in 2024, 376 fixed penalty notices have been issued in these areas including the adjacent

St. Nessan’s Road.

An Garda Síochána may also enforce illegal parking and are currently running their Think

Before You Park Campaign which focuses on illegal parking on footpaths which blocks the

passageway for pedestrians and those with disabilities.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update from the***

***Rural, Community and Culture Development Department on what progress has been made in the***

***provision of a Community Centre for the Dooradoyle/Raheen area following the completion of a***

***feasibility study in early 2023.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City & County Council – The main findings of the above feasibility were previously

presented to the Elected Members at a metro briefing for Limerick City West.

The next stage is to consider location(s) and design for Dooradoyle/Raheen as a distinct

community for the purposes of community centre for the area. Any potential area(s) for

the location of and development of a Community Centre is dependent on site specific

feasibility study being carried out and this is subject to site and resources being identified

to do so.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what engagement has***

***occurred between the Emergency Services and Active Travel in relation to the provision of***

***segregated cycle lanes within our City and Suburbs. In particular, what consideration has been***

***given to the movement of motor traffic in the event of an emergency since the changing of the***

***kerb height from 60mm to 100mm alongside the road edge on some schemes.***
---
12

**REPLY**: A number of recent Part 8 planning applications from Active Travel have been referred to

An Garda Siochána, including the Fr. Russell Road Active Travel Scheme and the St Paul’s -

Ballykeefe Active Travel Scheme.

As part of Active Travel’s internal consultation processes in respect of the statutory planning

process, the Fire Service is consulted at pre planning stage and when necessary, as the

application is lodged, and asked for observations on same.

Each scheme developed and designed by the Active Travel Department is designed to the

standards set out in Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) and the Cycle

Design Manual (CDM). The Cycle Design Manual specifically states that consideration

should be given to emergency vehicles on constrained routes where there is a high

likelihood of such vehicles passing.

In relation to kerbing, the CDM allows for a minimum step down of 60mm. The Active Travel

standard details, which were discussed with elected members and the Operations

Department, utilise a step down of 100mm. This is because the greater depth limits the

potential trip hazard of a 60mm kerb and reduces the likelihood of public liability claims.

This was the option preferred by the Operations Department. The depth of the stepped

down cycle track also limits the risk of parking occurring on the cycle track. The cycle track

kerb also has a chamfered edge to allow for bounce back in the event of a mistake by a

cyclist that may otherwise result in the cyclist going over the edge of the kerb into live traffic.

A number of Active Travel schemes contain various dropped kerb locations, which facilitate

cars pulling in, in the event of an emergency vehicle needing priority. Emergency vehicles

will also be able to straddle the cycle kerb if required due to their greater wheel base height.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the report for the***

***extension of the Castleconnell Playground has been completed and is available on request.***

**REPLY**: The only report that is available in relation to the Castleconnell Playground is the quarterly

inspection report for the existing playground, which details play items that require repair.

In order to provide an uplift to the existing playground, the Council decided on a number

of actions as an interim measure until the playground is fully upgraded and extended. A

contractor has been appointed to replace the basket swing which is expected to arrive in

4-6 weeks’ time costing €8,320.99 plus VAT. It was considered that this was the priority

item, the cost of replacing the swing and carousel is €19,530 plus VAT but there is no

funding in place for these items. The playground equipment and surfacing have been power

washed and we are arranging for the existing equipment to be painted in the coming weeks.

In relation to the extension of the playground, the Council are awaiting tenders from

Consultants to upgrade and extend the existing playground.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on plans for***

***a Park and Ride facility at Coonagh/Clondrinagh.***
---
13

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council in conjunction with the National Transport Authority is

currently reviewing suitable sites for a Park and Ride Facility out at Coonagh/Clondrinagh.

Consideration is being given to establishing a temporary Park and Ride Facility to serve

commuters in the short term. This option is in the early stages of development and further

updates will be provided in due course.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the measurements of***

***the table top and slope of the traffic calming measures on Brookville Avenue, and please detail***

***if this meets guideline height and slope on routes used regularly by buses and trucks, as excessive***

***heights are causing noise disturbance at night time.***

**REPLY**: The concerns are noted. It is accepted (in particular now that Bus Connects has been

finalised) that some alterations may be required to any traffic calming measures that do

not meet guidelines for Bus Routes. It is also accepted that the installations in question

having been reviewed by the district engineers and having regard to the updated Traffic

Calming Policy (currently in draft for approval) are likely to require rectifications to meet

compliance for Bus Connects routes.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***Shopfront Design Guidelines for Limerick City.***

**REPLY**: The Forward Planning, Public Realm and Heritage Section have commenced the preparation

of the Shop Front Design Guidelines and it is expected that the guidelines will be finalised

in Q3 2024.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress has been***

***made on the crypt and church in Mt. St. Laurence old cemetery as a commitment was given***

***previously on this.***

**REPLY**: The temporary external security fencing and remedial works to the exterior crypt access

have been rectified and reinstated so as to mitigate any potential access to the

underground crypt, until permanent restoration work is carried out to the Mortuary Chapel.

A scope of work to inform the appointment of an accredited Conservation Architect and

appropriate experienced contractor is in hand and procurement of this Consultant is

underway. Once appointed, a method statement will be prepared for the proposed

restoration works to the protected structure, which will be included in a funding application

through the historic structures fund and thereafter procure a contractor to carry out the

appropriate works to the Mortuary Chapel.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**
---
14

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what progress has been***

***made on a new location for the bring centre in Castleconnell as the current one is insufficient and***

***not in a suitable location.***

**REPLY**: The Environment Section of Limerick City and County Council is currently engaged in the

search for alternative locations for Bring Banks in Castleconnell. We are actively

collaborating with our property team and local businesses to identify a site that fulfils all

the required criteria. This includes factors such as appropriate access, parking facilities, and

compliance with health and safety regulations.

We are open to considering alternative locations proposed by the community or community

groups. In fact, we welcome such proposals and are willing to work collaboratively with

them to secure a new location that meets the necessary requirements. By fostering a

cooperative approach, we aim to find the most suitable site for the Bring Banks in

Castleconnell, benefiting both the community and the environment.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council convert the Walled Garden in Mungret into a sensory garden for the people of***

***Limerick.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Butler, seconded by Councillor McSweeney and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Butler stated that the provision of a suitable space would have

positive benefits for people’s well-being and the community.

**REPLY**: The Walled Garden in Mungret that is referred to in the Notice of Motion, is in the

ownership of Limerick City and County Council, and is currently zoned as residential. A

decision in relation to its future use has not been made as of yet and is something that may

have to be looked at in an overall masterplan for this location area.

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council prepare tenders for the design, build and operate of a new multi-purpose***

***community centre on Council owned land that currently accommodates Dooradoyle Men's Shed.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin highlighted the population increase in the Dooradoyle

/ Raheen area with further housing developments proposed for Mungret, and the urgent need to

provide a centre for the community.
---
15

**REPLY**: There is an identified need for a community centre in the Raheen/Dooradoyle area. The

Council Executive will consider the proposal that the Council owned site which currently

accommodates the Dooradoyle Men’s Shed Group will be considered in the context of the

best use of this site. In the past the Council has supported community groups/organisations

to develop and manage community centres but a community/group organisation has yet

to be identified to lead this project should a suitable site be identified.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council request an urgent meeting with the National Transport Authority to fast track the***

***provision of a park and ride site in Raheen to alleviate the chronic traffic congestion and parking***

***in private housing estates.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Leddin highlighted the issue of illegal parking in housing

estates, which was causing difficulties for emergency vehicles and waste trucks, and the benefits

that a park and ride site would provide.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council in conjunction with the National Transport Authority is

actively working on progressing the Park and Ride Facility in Raheen. Discussions are

ongoing with local landowners with a view to acquiring a suitable site. Once secured a Part

8 planning application will be progressed.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council reinstate estate managers in regeneration areas and funded through the***

***community as this arrangement previously applied before the commencement of the***

***Regeneration Programme.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Collopy and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan stated that the Estate Managers had been doing

vital work in regeneration areas and were a huge loss to the community.

**REPLY**: The Council has an existing Community Sustainment team which supports estate

management and individual tenancy issues. Additional resources in this area and the

funding of estate management in general is a matter for the annual budget process.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council clarify the situation regarding bring banks and put in place a plan for maintaining***

***the bring banks and that the Council considers installing CCTV at these locations.***
---
16

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor O’Donovan

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) highlighted the importance of having a cleaning

maintenance schedule in place for bring banks.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council is currently in the process of preparing a tender for the

operation and management of the 65 Bring Bank sites within its jurisdiction. Many of these

sites have experienced recurring incidents of illegal dumping so as part of the tender

process, we will be including a response service in this contract for the clean-up of waste

materials at these locations.

The recent implementation of the Codes of Practices regarding the Prevention, Detection,

and Prosecution of Waste and Litter Offences utilizing CCTV and Mobile Recording Devices

(MRDs) is regarded as a valuable tool in addressing the issue of illegal dumping at Bring

Bank sites. In order to warrant the installation of CCTV at these sites, it is required to

conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment that is backed up by substantial justification.

This justification will take into account various factors, including the frequency of reported

incidents at these locations. If deemed necessary and supported by evidence, the

installation of CCTV will be considered for all Bring Bank sites across the county.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council writes to the LDA to ask them to put in place a team based in Limerick to deliver***

***the housing projects earmarked for Limerick in a quicker fashion.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor Kiely and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) noted the earlier presentation at the Meeting

from the Land Development Agency and re-iterated that a full time and fully staffed office and

delivery team were required in Limerick, as there were only two people assigned at present.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council outline its proposals to address the issues relating to the proper upkeep and***

***maintenance of cemeteries, located within the Metropolitan District of Limerick.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Pond and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery expressed concern at the poor condition of the

cemeteries, with weeds, grass overgrown and bins overflowing.

**REPLY**: There are forty one cemeteries within the Metropolitan District, the four main cemeteries

are managed by the Council, nine cemeteries with the assistance of Limerick Civic Trust and

twenty two by local cemetery community groups with the remaining six having minimal
---
17

upkeep. The Council provides an annual maintenance grant to community groups along

with them being able to apply for annual community enhancement programme grants

towards the purchase of equipment.

The Council also provides an annual maintenance programme of works in relation to repair

of walls, footpaths, drainage and tree surgery works and works prioritised in accordance

with the available budget for these works. The Council are currently reviewing grass cutting

arrangements in the main city cemeteries and general maintenance in those cemeteries to

address the issues that have been reported. In addition, the Council are putting in place a

Service Level Agreement with Limerick Civic Trust which will outline the level of service that

is required to ensure an appropriate standard of maintenance.

**30.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the restrictions on***

***capacity at Mungret Recycling Centre for green waste from small businesses be lifted by Limerick***

***City and County Council and a solution is examined as soon as possible.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor McSweeney and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kiely highlighted the difficulties for small businesses, who had

to travel long distances to dispose of green waste, and the need to resolve the situation.

**REPLY**: The Council had to restrict green waste coming in to the recycling centre in Mungret as

there was insufficient capacity to manage the amount of green waste in the yard. The

Council are currently looking at options to reduce the stockpile in the yard, the public can

avail of the composted material free of charge but the stockpile is not being reduced as

much as the Council would like. The Council are looking at the possibility of moving some

of the material to Newcastle West and Kilmallock Civic Amenity Sites but advance works

are required to facilitate this.

The Council will review the situation in a number of weeks to determine when commercial

green waste can be received. It is important to point out that only green waste will be

accepted, rubble and other construction materials mixed with green waste will not be

accepted and will be turned away. The green waste material being received in the last

number of months has been of good quality, allowing the Council to process and shred the

material resulting in a composted material that was used for planters in the city centre. It

is the Council’s objective to further improve the quality of the composted material in the

Mungret Horticulture yard and continue recycling the green waste and consider for further

use, in particular for the flower baskets and flower tiers in the city.

**31.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to the***

***Gardai and request resources for the enforcement of the speed limit and the weight restrictions***

***on the Commons Road and Drombanna Village.***
---
18

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M) and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kiely highlighted the issues with speeding in the area. She

stated that the hedges needed to be cut back close to the crossroads.

**REPLY**: Limerick City & County Council Roads Department has formally written to the Gardaí to

review the enforcement of the speed limit and the weight restrictions on the Commons

Road and Drombanna Village.

**32.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with the LCETB to look at retaining the basketball courts and adjacent***

***space on Mungret Community College grounds for a Municipal sports area as they vacate it this***

***summer.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Butler, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Butler highlighted the importance of providing sporting and

recreation facilities, in particular for young people.

**REPLY**: The Council will engage with Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board in relation to

this matter with a view to increasing the availability of sports facilities in the area subject to

budgetary resources.

**33.Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

This concluded the Meeting.

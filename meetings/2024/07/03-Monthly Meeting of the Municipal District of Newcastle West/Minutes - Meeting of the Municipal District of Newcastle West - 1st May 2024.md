In 2023 the following allocations were made to Limerick City and County Council with

respect to drainage:

Drainage Works €865,000

The Metropolitan area received €265,000 with the 3 rural districts receiving €200,000.

2023 Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Works €655,000

This funding was provided on a job specific basis and was apportioned based on a department

review of submitted schemes.

While these are the two main funding sources associated with drainage, money is also made

available to the areas in the form of Own resources and the Discretionary Grant to manage

drainage issues. This money is managed by the Municipal District and is apportioned on a

needs basis and includes for an element of gully cleaning, outlet management and other

drainage works on both the regional and local road network. Through the Districts own

resources allocation inlet opening /maintenance occurs during the wetter months of the year

usually from October to March annually. Furthermore a suction sweeper is employed on a

daily basis from November through to end March with the emphahis on removing leaves from

urban locations as well as cleaning out the gullies.

I confirm that CES Environmental were employed throughout the latter end of 2023 and for

the early months of 2024 to clean the existing surface water network throughout the district.

This work was very effective during the wet period from September 2023 to April 2024

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***for an update on all the derelict buildings in Abbeyfeale, the***

***stages that all are at. It appears that there is very little movement on same.***

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council continues to identify vacant homes and derelict sites by

regular surveys completed throughout the local authority’s administrative area. Public

representatives, members of the public and by local community groups, also bring such

inactive and unproductive properties to the attention of the Council.

A full copy of the Derelict Sites Register maintained by the Council pursuant to section 8 of

the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as amended), is available for inspection during office hours at the

Property Management Department, Merchants Quay, Limerick, or it may be downloaded in

summary from www.limerick.ie/council

Limerick City and County Council currently has **24 no**. active derelict sites cases in Abbeyfeale.

of these, there are **22 no.** cases where the particulars of the land are entered in the Derelict

Sites Register.

Abbeyfeale is a beneficiary of the Rural Limerick Housing Development programme (RLHD),

funded in part by the Government’s Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. This fund

has enabled the Council to activate a number of heretofore neglected and unsightly sites in

the town, for example residences on Convent Road and two units on Colbert Terrace heading

towards total renovation and re-use, being soon followed by contrators appointment for

renovation of properties on Old Church Street and New Street in the coming weeks.

Progress is also evident in the number of closed cases where owner themselves have engaged

with the Council and solved the dereliction.

In summary, the status of derelict sites cases is as follows:

**REF. NO.**

NOTICES OF MOTION

***Abbeyfeale at the town side of Buckley’s Cross.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to a number of road traffic accidents

which have taken place at this location and requested that speed meters be installed at the

Railway Road in Abbeyfeale on the approach to the town. In replying, the Executive Engineer

agreed to follow up on this request. The Members also made reference to the issue of

speeding and to the importance of having average speed cameras put in place in the District.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***Traffic Management Plan.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:
---
13

Commercial rates are legally payable on all commercial properties. A Vacant Property

Allowance Scheme has been adopted by the Council and all other businesses are liable to pay

rates. This policy is consistent in all areas of the city and county. The roadworks/

improvement works are managed to ensure minimum disruption to the business community.

The Rates Section offers an annual Small and Medium Business Enterprise Scheme, whereby

the rate-payer may be entitled to 13.5% rebate of their annual rates, up to a maximum grant

of €1,500.

Also the Increased Cost of Business Grant, funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and

Employment is currently available to rate-payers and applications for same are open until 1st

May, 2024.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to the recent roadworks which took place

in the town of Abbeyfeale. He stated that there was major traffic congestion in the town

which led to retail businesses being seriously affected. He requested that the car park in the

town be prioritised before any further works take place and that consideration be

given to an alternative traffic management system when roadworks are due to take place

again. All the Members welcomed the project but however concurred with Councillor Galvin

on the traffic congestion and disruption to businesses in the town. Councillor Sheahan also

referred to the manner in which the town was left in the evening following the works.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would refer this Notice

of Motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee

for consideration.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that trading premises in the towns of our Municipality***

***are allowed a minimum of two Parking Permits where a residential need co-exists with that***

***of the business.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

Currently the bye-laws allow for one residential parking space/permit in the Municipal District

of Newcastle West. There is no provision for a commercial permit.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that a minimum of two residential

parking permits be given where a residential and commercial need exist. A brief discussion

took place and in replying, the Meetings Administrator referred to a Meeting of the

Transportation and Mobility Strategic Policy Committee which took place in April 2024. She

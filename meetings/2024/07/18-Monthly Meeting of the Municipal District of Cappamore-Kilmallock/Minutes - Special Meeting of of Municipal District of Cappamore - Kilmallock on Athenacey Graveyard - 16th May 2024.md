1. Declaration of Interests

There was no interest declared. The protocol for blended meetings was read into minutes.

2. Discussion on Athenacey Graveyard

An Cathaoirleach outlined the events to date since the submission of a question in 2021 and

Notice of Motion in 2023 regarding access and parking at Athenacey Graveyard.

Clarification on ownership and the right of way at the graveyard was sought by the

Cathaoirleach.

The Senior Engineer clarified that the Burial Grounds are vested in Limerick City and County

Council and the Local Authority has sought legal advice regarding the right of way.

A discussion took place regarding alternative options for parking and access. The Senior

Executive Engineer for roads and Director of Services clarified that there are currently no

alternative options for access and parking which would meet roads safety standards for

sightlines. It was confirmed that signage at the graveyard could be considered.

The Senior Engineer advised that the most recent developments undertaken at the entrance

to the graveyard have been referred to planning enforcement for consideration.

Clarification was provided that any consideration of a Compulsory Purchase Order would

require a Part 8 planning process, and the most appropriate option is to consider an

agreement between the community and landowners in the first instance.

The Senior Engineer also advised that this situation exists at numerous locations around the

country and seeking legal advice on right of way is the most appropriate option.
---
The Director of Services reiterated that the mediation process undertaken in 2023 between

the Community, Landowner and Local Authority was a confidential process and not for

discussion at this meeting.

The Senior Engineer advised the meeting that the Local Authority is satisfied to reopening

discussions with the landowner, and requested that the representative for the landowner

convey this to the landowner.

The Cathaoirleach agreed to engage with the community on the issue and revert back to the

Senior Engineer.

The Cathaoirleach thanked everyone in attendance.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

**I will ask at next Meeting when was the most recent tenants handbook published, what**

**changes were made and were all Council tenants given a handbook as well as being made**

**aware of the changes.**

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council published its current tenant handbook in late

2019 following a full review of the existing tenant handbooks in place (one for

the Limerick City Council and one for Limerick County Council pre the merger

of the two authorities) in line with the services delivered to Council tenants by

the merged Authority. Officials from the Community Sustainment Unit held a

number of cross-departmental meetings with relevant internal stakeholders to

ensure that all aspects of tenancy related services would be included in the

new and updated tenant handbook.

A copy of the tenant handbook was uploaded to the Council’s website at the

time of publishing.

From January 2020 onwards, all newly appointed tenants have received a copy

of the tenant handbook, which is included in their Tenancy Induction pack. The

Community Sustainment Officer review the tenant handbook with the

tenant(s) as part of the Tenancy Induction training programme.

An extract from the tenant handbook titled “Maintenance and Repairs” of

Limerick City and County Council properties was circulated in January 2020 to

all 5,500 tenants. At this time, all tenants were informed in writing that the

full version of the tenant handbook was available on line and the link was

provided in the letter, which accompanied the extract.

Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on my Motion from January 2022 calling for the**

**creation of a Local Food and Catering Sustainable Purchasing Policy for this local authority.**

**REPLY:**

The Motion from January 2022 was referred to the Economic Development,

Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee, which was held on 23rd

February, 2022. Following discussion on that item at the Economic

Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee, the Council

Executive response was outlined as follows:

*Limerick City and County Council is obliged to comply with the principles*

*of EU Public Procurement Directives, National Regulations and*

*Government Guidelines with regard to all policies involving the*

*purchase of goods and services. Limerick City and County Council fully*

*supports the principles outlined in the notice of motion particularly with*

*regard to supporting the local food system and increasing employment*
---
16

*within the local food sector. The Council’s procured supplier for the*

*provision of catering services is a Limerick business employing many*

*locals. Further development and consideration of the Environmental*

*Protection Agency’s Green Public Procurement Principles will be taken*

*into account where feasible as the Council renews contracts for catering*

*services.*

On the proposal of Councillor O’Sullivan, seconded by Mayor D. Butler, it was

agreed that the wording would be revised to incorporate ‘*that the Council*

*would write to the relevant Minister with responsibility for Public Procurement*

*to seek guidance in relation to the development of a policy on the procurement*

*of sustainable food and beverages, and catering services**.’*

The Council wrote to Mr. Ossian Smyth, T.D., Minister of State with

responsibility for Public Procurement and eGovernment, requesting said

guidance on 6th April, 2022. No response has been forthcoming to date. The

Council will write to Minister Smyth again in relation to this matter.

NOTICES OF MOTION

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will move at the next Meeting that we request the Minister for Justice to immediately**

**review the Fee Structure that presently applies to the adaptation of Irish Naturalisation.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Scanlan, seconded by Councillor Ryan (E), and

adopted.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale –

Councillors K. Sheahan (Proposer), B. Collins, S. Keary, E. O’Brien, J.

O’Donoghue, A. Teskey

**We will move at the next Meeting if a recipient of carers allowance is living with elderly**

**parents who are in receipt of the old age pension, their carers allowance adds to the rent**

**of the social house they are living in. We believe that this should be addressed by the**

**Elected Members and the extra charge on the rent account that is now incurred should be**

**removed as we consider this to be unfair and unjust.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (K), seconded by Councillor Teskey,

and adopted.

It was also agreed to refer the Motion to the Housing Strategic Policy Committee as

outlined in the Reply.

**REPLY:**

Rental income from its housing stock (circa 5600 units) is a very important

revenue stream for the Council and is projected to amount to in excess of

€19m in 2024. Any downward adjustment to the income criteria would have
---
17

an inevitable impact on the level of services that the Council can provide. In

order to quantify the financial impact of same the Housing Directorate would

need to analyse the rent accounts of 8961 households in some detail – to

include RAS and HAP tenancies, the rents of which are also calculated with

reference to the Differential Rents Scheme. This would represent a massive

body of work, which would take some time to complete.

Carer’s Allowance was introduced by the Government many years ago to

compensate people who are caring for a person in need of full-time care

because of age, disability or illness. Those deemed eligible for same do not

then have to rely on other forms of social welfare support, such as Jobseeker’s

Allowance etc., which are defined as income in calculating rent liability. The

Differential Rent Scheme calculates the total household income and Carer’s

Allowance is no different to other incomes such as the following non-

exhaustive list:-

-

Income from employment

-

Maintenance Payments

-

Job Seekers Benefit/Allowance

-

Illness Benefit

-

Deserted Wives Benefit

-

Invalidity Pension

-

Disablement Benefit

-

Widows Pension

-

Injury Benefit

Income from the Allowance has been reckonable for rent assessment purposes

for many years, both by Limerick County Council and Limerick City Council prior

to amalgamation, and the joint new authority subsequently. The adoption of

a Differential Rent Scheme is an executive function and the last significant

review took place in February 2020, with the aim of introducing a standard

calculation method across the board for both city and county tenants.

There have been indications for some time that the Minister was considering

the introduction of a standardised National Differential Rents Scheme to be

applied across all local authorities. This aim was included in the 2020

Programme for Government and in the housing action plan, Housing for All. It

appears that moves are now being made to act on this and, by Circular Letter

17/2024 dated the 23rd May 2024 issued by the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage, the Minister has indicated that it is aimed to scope

and develop proposals for a national, standardised scheme in Q4 2024 and, to

assist in this, has instructed all local authorities to provide up to date data in

relation to rents payable by their tenants.

In the light of the foregoing, it is recommended that this Motion be referred

to the Housing Strategic Policy Committee for further consideration along with

any updates on a national Differential Rents Scheme.

**Suspension of Standing Order No. 4**: At this point in the Meeting, the Mayor drew attention

to the time which was approaching 5.30 p.m., and on the proposal of Councillor Sheehan (J),

seconded by Councillor Egan, Standing Order No. 4 was suspended in order to complete the

agenda.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the Minister for Social Protection**

**asking her to explain why Community Welfare Officers are not available in clinics at Intreo**

**Offices.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Scanlan, and

adopted.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Slattery outlined that the services provided by the

Community Welfare Officers have moved online, and pointed out the difficulty this has caused

for people using those services.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

**I will move at the next Meeting that the tenant handbook be amended to reflect that the**

**tenant is not responsible for the boundary wall or fence of a Council property where there**

**is no fault on the tenant.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely and seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J).

**REPLY:**

The current tenant handbook was produced in late 2019. Limerick City and

County Council will undertake a review of the tenants handbook in the lifetime

of the next Council through the Housing Strategic Policy Committee. In the

meantime, any boundary issues that are presented will be reviewed on a case-

by-case basis.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Ryan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister**

**for Finance, Michael McGrath, T.D., and the Government, to allow taxpayers one week**

**where no tax is paid, in line with Social Welfare recipients whereby their welfare payments**

**increase at Christmas; and, if agreed, that the Motion be circulated to all Local Authorities.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Ryan (E), seconded by Councillor Scanlan and

adopted.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. O’Donoghue

**I will move at the next Meeting that the Council write to the relevant Government**

**Departments for the establishment of a fund for the rehabilitation of our older housing**
---
19

**estates. This fund to be used for the upgrade of footpaths and open spaces and to include**

**extra parking spaces if required. This funding is required for the safety of every person living**

**in, working or visiting these estates.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Teskey,

and adopted.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Teskey

**I will move at the next Meeting, given current guidelines and planning appears inconsistent**

**with the WHO recommended noise limits, and it is my understanding that Limerick City and**

**County Council has received complaints of sleep deprivation from wind farm neighbours,**

**that this Council write to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications**

**to seek advice on what actions or remedies can be made available to the neighbours of**

**existing wind farms.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue,

and adopted.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Teskey raised concerns for the residents of Coolcappa in

County Limerick that are living near the proposed wind farm, and the effects this may have

on their health. Members welcomed the Motion and highlighted the need for the

Government to publish regulations on wind farms as a matter of urgency.

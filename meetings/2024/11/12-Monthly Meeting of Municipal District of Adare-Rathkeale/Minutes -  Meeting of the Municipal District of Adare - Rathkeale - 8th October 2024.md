Climate Action gave Members a presentation on maximising potential future usage of

Gortadroma Landfill.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Limerick Clare Energy Agency advised there is an existing

water-to-energy enterprise in operation in Gortadroma whereby waste gas is used to

generate electricity. However, financial support provided under a renewable energy

support scheme ceased in June 2024 and as gas is becoming non-viable due to its

diminishing volumes it was agreed that proposals should be sought to explore innovative

and cost-effective options available in the marketplace to utilise undeveloped areas of the

former landfill site. This process would involve an expression of interest being advertised

in Q4 2024 whereby interested parties would be invited to submit proposals for the future

usage of the facility. Any proposal submitted would be subject to a briefing to the Elected

Members as well as a public consultation advising them of the outcome and how the

process will proceed.

Members thanked Ms. Mellett and Mr. McDonagh for their presentation. Discussion

ensued among Members and the following issues were raised:

 Councillor Teskey queried if the site could be sold privately. The Senior Executive

Engineer, Environment and Climate Action advised this is not possible due to a 20

year licence agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency for the site.

 Councillor O’Donoghue queried what other European Union countries had done

with similar sites. The Senior Executive Engineer, Environment and Climate Action

advised some countries had turned their sites into parks or solar farms among

other things.

John O’Callaghan, Executive Engineer, Active Travel gave Members a presentation on

the installation of new bus shelters at Ballyneety and Shanagolden saying.

in Ballyneety the new bus shelter is proposed to be relocated from its current position.

In order to facilitate this installation it is proposed to increase the width of the existing

required.

In Shanagolden the new bus shelter is proposed to be located at its current position in

the village. In order to facilitate this installation it is proposed to increase the width of

the existing footpath by 200mm and minor modifications to the exiting road centreline

will also be required.

ensued in relation to the issue of buses stopping on the public road. Councillor

Executive Engineer, Active Travel advised the green area is privately owned and it would

not be cost effective to re-locate the bus stop to this area. He further added a safety

audit had been carried out and it had concluded it would not pose a danger to road users

if the bus stop were to be located on the public road.

Councillor Teskey also raised the issue of some Bus Éireann buses not turning up as per

the schedule as listed in Rathkeale Town. Councillor Hartigan added there is also an issue

with the 314 bus route at Barrigone, Askeaton and has been told the driver can be very

abusive to passengers. The Executive Engineer, Active Travel advised Members to

forward details of both routes and he would have the issues investigated with the Head

of Service Delivery in Bus Éireann. Councillor Keary asked if the Executive Engineer, Active

Travel could contact Dublin Coach with a view to introducing a bus route at the Palatine

Museum in Rathkeale as it would greatly benefit students travelling to University of

Limerick. The Executive Engineer, Active Travel agreed to examine this proposal in

conjunction with representatives of Dublin Coach.

---

REPLY:

Limerick City and County Council Roads Department do not implement any control measure

to deal with the effects of Hymenoscyphus Fraxineus (Ashdieback) on roadside trees. It is up

to the landowner or property owner to maintain trees and hedges along their property road

boundaries as per Section 70 of the Roads Act.

In the context of public trees, the Council is taking a more proactive approach to tree

maintenance as cases arise through the DYNAMICS CRM platform. When a case is submitted

for a particular tree in a housing estate, the Council inspects all trees in the housing estate. If

there are ash trees present, they are checked for evidence of ash dieback. These trees will be

monitored and the Council will address on a case by case basis and may carry out remedial

works where necessary.

In the longer term, the tree policy, recognises the potential danger of ash dieback. The policy

proposes to assess the threat posed to public trees from it and develop an action plan to

manage the threat to public trees. However, there is no budget allocated to deal with this

issue going forward.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the dangers associated with ash trees

affected by Ashdieback and a discussion took place on this matter. The costs involved for

landowners in having a Traffic Management Plan and tree surgeon in place to remove these

trees was also raised.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting that the footpaths along Bóthar Buí, Newcastle West, be***

***upgraded.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY:

Footpaths at Bóthar Buí can be considered for NTA Works 2025 subject to

Department approval.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the need for footpaths along Bóthar

Buí, Newcastle West and other locations in the District. An update was also sought on the

petition which was submitted for the provision of traffic calming measures at Bóthar Buí and

it was agreed that a site meeting would be arranged to discuss this matter further.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that*** ***a safety audit be carried out in Collins Park, Abbeyfeale,***

***in the following areas: (a) Parking especially the section from House No. 38 to 51 and House***

***No. 60 to 77, (b) All footpaths within the estate, (c) Road markings (d) Signage (e) Rights of***

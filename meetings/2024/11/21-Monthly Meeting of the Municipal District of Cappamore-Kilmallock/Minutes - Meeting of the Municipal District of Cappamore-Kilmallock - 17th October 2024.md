Members welcomed Audrey Crowe, Administrative Officer, Property Management

Department to the meeting who proceed with a presentation on the current Derelict Site

process within Limerick City and County Council.

Following this presentation Members raised the following issues with regard to the process.

Councillor O’Sullivan (T) asked if a property is deemed derelict has it to be liveable to be taken

out of dereliction.

Audrey Crowe, Administrative Officer responded saying the derelict nature of the property

has to be addressed and added the staff of the Property Management are available to engage

with the owners of Derelict properties and Elected Members if required.
---
Councillor Ryan (M) asked more work be invested in tracing ownership of derelict properties

as some owners may not be aware of dereliction notices being placed on doorways of

properties as they may not be living locally. He also requested Property Management be

considerate of owners who fall into this category.

Councillor Conway (G) asked that the Property Department liaise with a family who have been

served with a derelict notice in the District as the owner is not in a position to deal with the

issue due to illness.

Councillor Conway (G) also added that the costs required to take some properties out of

dereliction are considerable and in some cases people do not have the means to carry out the

necessary works to take a property out of dereliction.

Councillor Teefy (B) asked for more communication and engagement between owners of

derelict properties and the Property Management Department and requested the Technician

for the Area meet with District Elected members.

Councillor Teefy also referred to the Croi Conaithe Scheme saying the qualifying criteria for

the scheme is quite onerous for the applicant and requested a presentation on this scheme

for the November meeting of the District.

Following further discussion the Cathaoirleach Martin Ryan requested the Property

Management Department going forward engage more with the elected Members of

Cappamore – Kilmallock in their particular areas when they are having difficulty in locating

owners of Derelict Properties.

Audrey Crowe, A.O. assured Members, her Department would ensure this was the case

going forward and also agreed the Area Technician with responsibility for Derelict sites in

the Cappamore-Kilmallock District would be in attendance with David O’Grady at the

November meeting

Subject: [EXTERNAL]Uisce Éireann RE: Uisce Éireann LRSD Query Reference Number 83135

Dear Ms Karen Butler,

I am writing to you today regarding your request for further detailed updates on the

Cappamore Boil Water Notice. Your Uisce Éireann reference number for same was 83135,

which was raised on the 16/10/2024.

I understand this issue has been a source of concern for you and your constituents.

Please see below updated briefing note that was circulated to all local representatives

earlier this week in relation to the above query.

 15 October 2024 – Uisce Éireann would like to remind customers supplied by the

Cappamore Foileen Public Water Supply that the Boil Water Notice issued on 26 September

2023 remains in place.
---
This notice was issued as a precautionary measure to protect the health of approximately

2,300 customers. The notice was put in place due to the detection of cryptosporidium in the

water supply. 

The notice impacts all customers supplied by the Cappamore Foileen Public Water Supply,

including Carrigmore, which is now supplied from the Cappamore Scheme. Customers can

check if their property is included by visiting www.water.ie and entering the property’s

Eircode or by calling the Uisce Éireann customer care helpline, open 24/7, on 1800 278 278.

A map of the area is attached and available to view on the supply and service section

of www.water.ie 

Uisce Éireann is continuing to prioritise works to safely lift this notice in the shortest

possible timeframe. Uisce Éireann is implementing remedial measures to existing processes

and is also undertaking upgrades at the plant. This includes the installation of a state-of-the-

art ultraviolet disinfection unit which will provide an effective and reliable barrier to

eliminate the risk of cryptosporidium. Detailed design work has been completed, along with

the construction of a new access road and earthworks. The ultraviolets (UVs) are currently

in transit with the installations works and associated pipework scheduled to commence this

month. The ESB are also working to upgrade the site and we are working closely with the

ESB to minimise any potential delay.

Uisce Éireann’s Duane O’Brien said, “We recognise the significant inconvenience to

impacted customers. Public health remains the number one priority for Uisce Éireann. Our

drinking water standards, as per EU Drinking Water regulations, are strict and include wide

safety margins. Where risks to water quality are identified through Uisce Éireann’s

enhanced testing and monitoring programme, the HSE (Health Service Executive) are

consulted, and Boil Water Notices are issued to protect public health.”

Vulnerable customers who have registered with Uisce Éireann receive direct communication

on BWNs. Customers are reminded that the water is safe to consume once boiled. 

 Water must be boiled for: 

\* Drinking; 

\* Drinks made with water; 

\* Preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating; 

\* Brushing of teeth;
---
\* Making of ice - discard ice cubes in fridges and freezers and filtered water in fridges.

Make ice from cooled boiled water.  

What actions should be taken: 

\* Use water prepared for drinking when preparing foods that will not be cooked (e.g.

washing salads); 

\* Water can be used for personal hygiene, bathing and flushing of toilets but not for

brushing teeth or gargling; 

\* Boil water by bringing to a vigorous, rolling boil (e.g. with an automatic kettle) and

allow to cool. Cover and store in a refrigerator or cold place. Water from the hot tap is not

safe to drink. Domestic water filters will not render water safe to drink; 

\* Caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure that they do not swallow

the bathing water; 

\* Preparing Infant Formula: Where a Boil Water Notice is in place, you can prepare

infant formula from tap water that has been boiled once (rolling boil for 1 minute) and

cooled beforehand. Bottled water can also be used to make up infant formula. All bottled

water, with the exception of natural mineral water, is regulated to the same standard as

drinking water. It is best not to use bottled water labelled as ‘Natural Mineral Water’ as it

can have high levels of sodium (salt) and other minerals, although it rarely does. ‘Natural

Mineral Water’ can be used if no other water is available, for as short a time as possible, as

it is important to keep babies hydrated. If bottled water is used to make up infant formula it

should be boiled once (rolling boil for 1 minute) and cooled in the normal way. Ready-to-use

formula that does not need added water can also be used.   

Great care should be taken with boiled water to avoid burns and scalds as accidents can

easily happen, especially with children. 

 Updates are available on our Water Supply Updates section on www.water.ie, on X

(formerly Twitter) @IWCare and via our customer care helpline, open 24/7 on 1800 278

278.  Uisce Éireann has also launched a free text service, providing real-time updates for

local issues. Customers can sign up with their Eircode and mobile number at www.water.ie .

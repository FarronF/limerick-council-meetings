He thanked the Mayor for engaging with the Members on the development of the Mayoral

Programme which, hopefully will be incorporated into the new Corporate Plan for the city and

county, and into the Capital and Service Delivery Plans. He welcomed the opportunity to work

together with everyone over the next five years, to help deliver on the objectives in the plan.

On behalf of the Members for the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale, Councillor Teskey

thanked the Mayor for attending the workshops. He stated the plan presented was far

reaching and it should be servicing local needs; for example construction and maintenance of

roads, cutting of hedgerows, provision and maintenance of housing and dealing with the

demands of the local community. He welcomed the planned rail investment for the District.

He took this opportunity to thank the Director General and his staff for the work done to date

in developing and maintaining services. He indicated that the objectives in the Mayoral

Programme are very much dependent on funding from central funding, and queried what

resources had been received to date.

On behalf of the Members for the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock, Councillor M.

Ryan outlined the following amendments;

 **CK01 Strategic Infrastructure and Connectivity**

 Inclusion of realignment of local bus services to rail connections in Adare and

Limerick City.

*a dog park, a playground, a sensory garden and a community vegetable patch which*

*would support accessibility for those with additional needs. Improved enforcement of*

*parking on footpaths, and improved parking facilities off road. To increase funding for*

*footpaths which are mobility friendly. To support the Mobility plans in Gotoon, Doon and*

*Cappamore. Funding for consultant to review and upgrade R513. Funding Low cost*

*safety schemes to upgrade pedestrian crossings.”***

Councillor M. Ryan also stated the Mayor had already identified the city centre as a priority

area for more Garda resources. However, he stressed that safety and security is a priority

across the whole city and county.

Members thanked the Mayor for his presentation on the Mayoral Programme and agreed it

was a comprehensive strategic document which will help develop Limerick further. However,

some Members expressed concerns in relation to areas that are situated outside the growth

triangle in the programme, while other Members emphasised the importance of public

infrastructure, developing the city centre, rural towns and villages and outlined the need for

festival and culture events across the city and county. Members also referred to the lack of

community centres in the outskirts of city centres and outlined the need to look at park and

ride facilities to enhance public transport.

Members indicated that everyone wanted to see progress across the city and county and

highlighted housing as a major issue facing Limerick. Some Members expressed concern at the

omission of Affordable Purchase in the Mayoral Programme, which would be of benefit to

many people and asked that this be incorporated in the programme. Members noted the need

to address the major housing issues, and agreed Limerick is not getting a fair share of national

funding required to increase the provision of housing in the city and county. It was also the

view of some Members that the Land Development Agency should be invited to address the

Members.---

Members also proposed that the Mayor should engage with outside bodies, such as Waterways

Ireland and Uisce Eireann, to enhance services across Limerick and addresses issues holding

back the development of infrastructure.

Members acknowledged that this is a unique opportunity to work together to develop Limerick

across the city and county, and expressed the importance of continuing to work together for

the betterment of the people of Limerick. Some Member believed the success of the

programme now depends on obtaining support and funding from Central Government.

In reply to the Members queries, the Mayor advised that Limerick is not getting its fair share of

funding from Central Government and he appealed to all political parties to put Limerick first.

He stated that to include Affordable Purchases at the scale that is required in Limerick would

involve substantial funding from Central Government. He stated housing was not affordable in

Limerick at present and this needs to be addressed.

The Mayor indicated that he has included monthly meetings with the Land Development

Agency in the programme. The Mayor shared the Members ambition for the extension of the

rail line throughout Limerick and indicated he has requested Irish Rail to do feasibility study on

cost.

He stated that each Directorate had been met on a number of occasions in relation to the

compilation of this programme and he confirmed that the new Programme Manager would be

consulted on a quarterly basis to monitor the process of the programme. He acknowledged

that a lot of work had been done to date by both officials and the Members. He indicated that

he has requested an analysis on proposed transport links in Moyross and such infrastructure

will determine the development in the area going forward. The Mayor noted that everyone

shared a common desire for what is best for Limerick.

The Director General confirmed that there was strong engagement with the Mayor in putting

together the Mayoral Programme and he pledged continued support going forward. He noted

that all parties had Limerick at its forefront and looked forward to working with everyone to

further develop Limerick in the future.

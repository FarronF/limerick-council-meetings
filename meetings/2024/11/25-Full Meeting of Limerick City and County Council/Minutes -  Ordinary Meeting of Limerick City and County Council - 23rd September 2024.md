Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee - Appointments

Circulated, report of the Mayor of Limerick dated 18th September, 2024, setting out

the background to appointments to the Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative

Committee. This was a Reserved Function of the Council and the four Elected Members had

Committee and the position could be reviewed at the end of the second year of appointment,

if required.

Councillor Hartigan (S) proposed to postpone the appointment of the Chairperson to

allow the Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee to appoint a Chairperson

from within the full committee. Members agreed it was a reasonable request to postpone

the appointment. In response, the Director of Housing, stated there is no issue with

postponing but reminded Councillors that it was a reserved function to appoint a Chairperson.

Following discussions, Members agreed to go ahead with the appointment of the

Chairperson.

Environment, Climate Action and Shared Services

Street Performance and Busker Bye-Laws 2024

Circulated, report of the Senior Executive Scientist, Environment and Climate Action,

enclosing a copy of the Limerick City and County Council Street Performance and Busker Draft

Bye-Laws, 2024.

Members welcomed the bye-laws and highlighted the need for them. However, they

expressed their concern that these draft bye-laws were not brought to the Community,

Leisure and Cultural SPC to include the arts and tourism element, and stated these bye-laws

are a great opportunity to promote Limerick as a vibrant city that welcomed artists and street

performances.

Members pointed out they would like to use these bye-laws to encourage more

buskers and street performers to come to Limerick City and County. They acknowledge the

need for regulation and enforcement but pointed out that both should be considered and

included in the bye-laws.

On the proposal of Councillor O’Sullivan, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), this item

was deferred.

In response, Director of Environment, Climate Action and Shared Service, thanked

Members for their input and agreed to take their views on board. He noted these Bye-Laws

were intended to regulate street performance but agreed to include the Arts and Tourism

Departments inputs.

The Director of Rural, Community and Culture acknowledged the Members comments

and outlined that he will seek the views of the Arts and Tourism Departments on street

performance and buskers before the draft Bye-Laws are brought back to the Council for

approval.

Planning and Place-Making

(a)

Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 – Progress Report

Circulated, report of the Mayor of Limerick dated 18th September, 2024, together with

Mayor’s Two-Year Progress Report dated 17th September, 2024, on the Limerick Development

Plan 2022-2028 – a report to the Elected Members on the progress achieved in securing the

objectives of the Plan, in accordance with Section 15(2) of the Planning and Development Act

2000 (as amended).

The Senior Planner, Forward Planning, Public Realm and Heritage, Planning and Place-

Making Directorate, gave a PowerPoint presentation on the Mayor’s two year progress report

on the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028.

The Senior Planner summarised for the Members the progress on Housing, Planning,

Spatial Strategy, Economic Development, Mobility and Transport and Environment, along

with updates on the advancement in the delivery of Sustainable Communities and Social

Infrastructure and the policies and objectives to address the issues of climate change.

She continued by outlining the deficit in the delivery of housing units, and informed

the Members that some of these deficits are due to items out of the Council’s control, namely

lack of services in towns and villages or land that is not owned by the Council. However, the

Senior Planner informed the Members that overall, that significant progress has been made

in the implementation of the Development Plan, and highlighted recommendations to

continue the progress of the plan, some of which are as follows:

 Invest in revitalisation, infrastructure, community facilities and the environment;

 Seek funding for and activate projects for Local Authority provided dwelling units;

 Work with all stakeholders to promote Limerick as a key choice for economic

investment, support enterprise, job creation and ensure sufficient lands are zoned and

serviced;

 Protect and enhance Limerick’s environmental and heritage assets, while managing

appropriate change;

 Invest in community infrastructure and progress the actions contained in the Local

Economic and Community Plan.

Members thanked the Senior Planner for the detailed presentation and for the work

in progressing the Development Plan. However, Members raised concerns over the deficit in

the delivery of housing, some of which are caused by matters outside the control of the

Council such as the capacity and quality of water services in towns and villages, private

landowners not developing strategic sites and the need for additional funding. In raising

these matters, Members highlighted Limerick’s strategic location in the Midwest.

Members also asked for an update on the Council’s plans to prepare for the Ryder Cup

2027, and requested that a presentation on preparations would be given to the Elected

Members, and this was agreed.
---
18

The Mayor referred to the progress report and acknowledged the work that has been

done to date to advance the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028. He emphasised the need

for more funding to allow Limerick City and County Council to deliver on the policies and

objectives set out in the plan. He advised the Members that he would continue to engage

with the Taoiseach and the various Ministers to seek more funding to allow the Council to

deliver on the objectives in the Development Plan for the betterment of the people of

Limerick.

**Suspension of Standing Order No. 4:** The Príomh Chomhairleoir drew attention to the time

which was approaching 5.30 p.m. and on the proposal of Councillor Galvin, seconded by

Councillor Stokes, Standing Order No. 4 was suspended in order to complete the agenda.

if approval for the Mayor to travel outside the country was a Reserved Function, and noted

he would revert to Members on the matter.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas **(to be referred to Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee together with Motions Nos. 24 and 32)**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if Limerick City and County Council will introduce in its***

***forthcoming budget a Community Hedge Cutting Grant Scheme to assist communities,***

***groups of local residents and landowners with the cutting of dangerous overhanging***

***hedges/tree branches along public roads, similar to the schemes provided by***

***Clare/Leitrim/Cork County Councils.***

13.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

***I will ask at the next Meeting of Limerick City and County Council for figures to be provided***

***for the number of people who presented to the Homeless Action Team seeking Supported***

***Temporary Accommodation services over the past 12 months, including those who did not***
---
23

***receive a service, so that we may be able to understand the true level of need in the city and***

***county:***

 ***How many people were advised to return home when they presented seeking***

***STA’s?***

 ***How many people were considered not entitled to a service?***

 ***How many were not able to access accommodation due to limits in capacity?***

REPLY:

The following table sets out the no. of presentations to the Homeless Action

Team. These presentations include both single and family presentations, in

general single presentations constitute a higher proportion of the overall no.

It is important to note that many Homeless presentations take place where

families or individuals are at risk of potential homelessness which may or may

not materialise over the coming months. There are a number of schemes in

place which are of valuable assistance in mitigating this potential risk such as

the Tenant in Situ Scheme, the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme, HAP Place

Finder etc. Every effort is made by the Homeless Action Team Office to prevent

the Homeless presentation becoming an actual Homeless placement in

Supported Temporary Accommodation.

There is a very different profile of reasons for Single and Family presentations

and many of the families presenting are on a Notice to Quit sometime into the

future and thus won’t need a service when they present. In many of these

cases the HAT team are able to prevent homelessness with the schemes that

have been outlined above.

No one is advised to return home when they present to Homeless Services they

are assessed thoroughly to ascertain their eligibility and service need.

Of the 591 presentations not placed in the last 12 months it should be noted

that the Homeless Action Team successfully worked on a collaborative basis

with all units in Housing to prevent homeless arising in almost 300 cases.

From an overview of the current year data it would appear that there is an

overall reduction in the year on year no of people not able to access Supported

Temporary Emergency Accommodation.

Many of the people who are unable to avail of the Supported Temporary

Accommodation are rough sleepers who have a range of complex needs that
---
24

prevent them from accessing services. In order to respond to this issue

Limerick City & County Council commenced a new initiative in conjunction with

Anna Liffey in early 2024, which endeavours to engage with rough sleepers

who cannot access services and encourage them to avail of services provided

by all relevant stakeholders.  Many rough sleepers are often reluctant to

engage with outreach teams and it can take a significant period of time for a

trust relationship to be established owing to the many complex issues that may

be present in these cases.

The reasons why emergency accommodation or HAP/social housing tenancy

was not provided, are varied, but can include as follows: -

 Have presented with a Notice to Quit but the notice may not come into

effect for a number of months so no service is required at that time.

 Subsequently secured private rented accommodation.

 Secured RAS/HAP accommodation – HAP accommodation is sourced by the

individual and records are not kept where individuals source their own HAP

accommodation following an earlier presentation of homelessness.

 Self-accommodated with family/friends.

 Did not qualify for homeless accommodation in accordance with legislative

requirements.

 Reasons for homeless presentation resolved, i.e. family breakdown etc.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

***I will ask at the next Plenary Meeting of Limerick City and County Council if measures are***

***being considered to clearly communicate and help implement the recent new laws***

***forbidding e-scooters from using footpaths.***

**REPLY:**

The Limerick Road Safety Working Together Group plays a vital role in road

safety promotion, together with its statutory obligations under roads and

traffic legislation. The Working Together Group is led and chaired by Limerick

City and County Council, and has representatives from a number of national

and local groups and organisations, including An Garda Síochána.

The next working group meeting is scheduled for October, and it is intended

to include the ‘Road Traffic (Electric Scooters) Regulations 2024’ on the agenda

for discussion. At that time, it will be determined how the Working Group can

help raise awareness of the implementation of the new e-scooter regulations

in Limerick.
---
25

Limerick City and County Council has a positive working relationship with An

Garda Síochána and will work together to clearly communicate the new e-

scooter Regulations.

15.

Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue

***I will ask at the next Plenary Meeting of Limerick City and County Council that in relation to***

***the number of Derelict Site notices issued in the past 5 years, how many sites have been***

***placed on the Derelict Sites Register with levies issued, and what subsequent actions have***

***been taken to encourage suitable occupation of these sites.***

**REPLY:**

Since 2019 to end August 2024, Limerick City and County Council has issued

2,672 no. statutory notices pursuant to the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as

amended).

Limerick City and County Council has entered the particulars of 537 cases on

to the Derelict Sites Register since 2019 and the details of 208 cases have been

removed in the same period.

Vacant Homes and Derelict Sites come to the attention of the Council in

various ways - Council staff proactively survey local areas in our towns, villages

and city; reports are made by the public, and complaints on offending

properties are received from local residents, community groups, and from

elected representatives.

To deal effectively with derelict sites, the Council uses powers available to it

under the Derelict Sites Act and will serve owners with statutory notices when,

for example, certain remedial works are required, when the site is entered in

the Derelict Sites Register, when a market value has been determined, to

demand payment of a Derelict Sites Levy, or, to notify the owner of its

intention to acquire the derelict site compulsorily, and if a vesting order is

ultimately made for the property.

The Council advises engaging owners on the remedial works required and on

relevant financial supports available, such as the Vacant Property

Refurbishment Grant, heritage and conservation schemes, and social leasing

schemes such as Buy and Renew and Repair and Lease.

The Council shall notify the owner when the details of the derelict site are

entered in the statutory Derelict Sites Register. The case details shall remain

entered in the Register until the site comes out of dereliction, and it no longer

detracts from the area, and is ideally put back into more effective use.

In cases where no progress is being made by an owner to solve the dereliction

and the site continues to detract from the neighbourhood, and where the

owner has already been served with a series of statutory notices, the Council
---
26

may consider the compulsory acquisition of the site with the intention to make

the property available for more productive and beneficial future uses.

Once a property vests to Limerick City and County Council, it is either allocated

to meet LCCC objectives, whether that is housing, community or other. If no

viable funded purpose is identified, then the properties are brought to market.

All disposals remain on the Derelict Site Register until they are no longer

considered derelict.

The Derelict sites team monitor progress on all disposed properties.

16.

Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will ask at the next Plenary Meeting of Limerick Council for an update on Council***

***responsibility and plan for the water quality of the River Deel considering the recent fish kill***

***in this river.***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council was notified of a pollution incident in the

River Deel at Castlemahon on 29 August. Upon investigation, the source of the

pollution was traced to the local water treatment plant. In response, the

Council, along with Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA), began working closely with Uisce Éireann to confirm the precise

cause of the contamination.

This process aims to fully understand the cause and impact of the pollution

and ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent a recurrence.

Uisce Éireann has been requested to review and strengthen its operational

procedures at the plant and to prepare a report on the incident, which we are

currently awaiting.

The situation is being monitored closely by all relevant bodies to ensure

compliance with environmental regulations and to protect the water quality of

the River Deel.

17.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

***I will ask at the next Meeting what is the amount paid and the outstanding balance on each***

***individual entry on the Vacant Site Register, including any of those who have been removed***

***from the Register, by register code.***

**REPLY:**

As per GDPR restrictions, Limerick City and County Council is not in a position

to release individual account information.

18.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely

***I will ask at the next Meeting how much did the project at the Crescent this summer cost***

***and can the cost be outlined in tabulated format.***
---
27

**REPLY:**

The Crescent Activation was but one of several August Activations across the

city. They saw the streets and some new spaces like the Wickham Way

transformed into vibrant hubs of community engagement and cultural

celebrations throughout the month of August.

Initially, it was planned to have activities near Nicholas Street, at the Potato

Market, The Hunt, and the Crescent as refurbishment was taken place in

Arthur’s Quay. It became quickly clear that the Milk Market Trustees could not

agree terms for the use of the Potato Market so it was deferred for another

time.

A key focus in the timing was on providing free activities for residents not able

to afford holidays away from Limerick over August and generating business in

Limerick at a normally quiet time.

The initiatives, aimed at promoting civic pride and showcasing Limerick’s rich

cultural heritage, featured a series of events that brought together residents

and visitors alike. The closure of the Crescent, as a trial, allowed for a safe and

enjoyable environment for all activities, contributing significantly to the overall

success of the initiative.

The Mayoral Programme and the Mayor’s election promises already required

him to “implement the New Town Park greening of the residential quarter of

Georgian Limerick “ and “finish off the development of O’Connell Street

incorporating the New Town Park idea of a significant public plaza at the

Crescent”.

The Mayoral Programme more generally speaks of a world in which O’Connell

Street and Georgian Limerick can be a globally recognised tourist destination

boasting sports, shopping, museums and dining. A public realm where

everyone enjoys quality and safe spaces and communities flourish.

The pilot changed many minds about the priority use of the public realm at the

Crescent. Limerick Civic Trust in particular were supportive. Moreover, by

revitalising the Georgian area, Limerick city not only enhances its cultural

heritage but also promotes residential occupancy, economic activity and urban

vibrancy.

The month long event led to increased community engagement with the space

accessed by dance groups, Gaeltacht Groups, wellness activity events,

International Rugby Experience, Mid-West Simon, Paul Partnership events and

local primary schools and crèches and Sacred Heart Catholic Church making

use of the area.

The Crescent also provided a space for cultural promotion with Ukraine

Independence Day, groups from Brazil performing their traditional dances, to
---

Hip Hop and Opera all being showcased during the month of August. Local

singers had the opportunity to perform for locals and visitors in the Festival in

a Van. At least two community dinners took place along with many lunch

meetings.

Businesses reported increased footfall, with local coffee shops and takeaways

benefitting from the rise in pedestrian traffic in the area and improved safety

for customers and staff working late.

Local resident Lorna Hodkinson said “I’m a local resident and we have

thoroughly enjoyed the Crescent, the month of August was amazing with

music and dancing, we had so much fun. The night that blew me away was the

Open Night Dinner, with everyone coming together showing a great

community effort”,

Local businesswoman, Janet from Angel Times said “I loved going up on my

lunchtime to the Crescent, a fantastic little extra for the city bringing extra

people into the city which is great from a retailer’s perspective.”

Local businessman Karim Hamadi of Khan Supermarket on Henry Street said,

“I would be very happy to see more events in the Crescent, it is good for

business and brings customers to the shop. You have my support for any

future events.”

Alternative parking arrangements were managed for residents during the

event. Residents were given permits to park in nearby streets. Although traffic

chaos was predicted by some, the Mayor’s Office closely monitored it

throughout the month with An Gardaí Síochána. On only one occasion was it

felt necessary to open it to relieve pressure – namely during a weekend when

numerous protests (on other grounds) were taking place in the city.

Local schools advised us they were pleased to use the open space, with many

children enjoying their lunches outdoors at the Crescent, further enhancing

the communal atmosphere.

Out of pocket costs were managed by

(i) the reduction of initial quotes for out sourcing of traffic management from

€60,000 to below €10,000

(ii) use of Council Teams as far as possible

(iii) calls to community groups to participate with modest stipends and

(iv) activation of local residents to help in the project

The full such costs, averaging €1,500.00 per day, are set out in the table below:

Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for the total amount spent on acquiring properties under the***

***local authority tenant in situ scheme.***

**REPLY:**

Since the Government lifted the Eviction Ban in March 2023, the Tenant In Situ

Scheme was introduced for all Local Authorities for acquisitions of properties

where a tenant is in receipt of social housing supports and has received a

Notice of Termination due to the landlord’s intention to sell the property. In

addition, Approved Housing Bodies can also apply for the Tenant in Situ

Scheme via Local Authorities.

Limerick City and County Council has delegated sanction in relation to these

acquisitions, subject to those acquisitions being within Acquisition Cost

Guidelines issued by the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Heritage which are issued on an annual basis. An independent valuation must

also be obtained for each acquisition.

To date, Limerick City and County Council has received budget approval for

€31,577,783.49, made up of €25,417,350.00 acquisition costs and

€6,160,433.49 refurbishment costs relating to essential works, in accordance

with the criteria of the Tenant In Situ Scheme.

Teskey, G. Ward

***We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council write to the***

***Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to request that NBI (National***

***Broadband Ireland) and Eir work together to share information and resources to ensure that***

23.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council scrap the current system of compensation***

***as a result of damage done to vehicles on rural roads, either by potholes or overhanging***

***hedges/trees, and take responsibility for all claims where proof is given.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Kiely, and

adopted.
---
31

**REPLY:**

The Council holds Public Liability Insurance in respect of third-party claims

made against it such as pothole claims. Typically, for this type of claim where

the Council has not carried out any works, it is not liable because of the legal

principle of non-feasance which was established in the Civil Liability Act 1961

and further emphasised in the Roads Act 1993. Irish Public Bodies (IPB) insures

all Local Authorities in the state and uses this defence to manage the cost of

premiums for all its members. All claims are considered on a case-by-case

basis.

In response, the Director of Transport and Mobility, outlined that it is the

landowners’ responsibility to maintain their hedgerows as set out in the Roads Traffic Act

1993, as amended. He agreed that a workshop would be organised through the Travel and

Transportation Strategic Policy Committee, when established, to review Limerick City and

County Council’s procedures on maintenance of hedgerows and to ensure there is

consistency across all Districts.

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir it was agreed to take items 24 and

32 together.

It was agreed to refer the Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee for consideration.

With the permission of the Príomh Chomhairleoir the Motion was allowed to be

discussed. This Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond and seconded by Councillor

Kilcoyne. In moving the Motion Councillor Pond outlined the issues for road users and

In response to both Motions, the Director of Transport and Mobility, outlined the

extensive amount of roadway that the Council maintains and the level of resources required

to maintain them. He noted it was an ongoing issue and notices are continuously issued to

landowners informing them of their responsibility to maintain the hedgerows on their own

land. He agreed to consider the inclusion of a budgetary measure for a community hedge

cutting grant, in the upcoming budget.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan

***I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council call on Minister***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan, seconded by Councillor Benson, and

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

***I will move at the next Plenary Meeting of Limerick Council that this Council will dis-regard***

***the half rate Carer's allowance in full and the disability allowance received by children aged***

***between 16 and 18 in full when calculating the rent of Council tenants under the Differential***

***Rent Scheme.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Hickey-

O’Mara, and adopted.

REPLY:

In accordance with the Differential Rent Scheme 2020, disability allowance

received by children aged between 16 and 18 is not assessed for rent purposes

and disability allowance received by young adults aged between 18 and 21

who are in full-time education is not assessed for rent purposes.

Carer’s Allowance was introduced by the Government many years ago to

compensate people who are caring for a person in need of full-time care

because of age, disability or illness. To qualify for carer’s allowance, you must

be 18 or over. Those deemed eligible for same do not then have to rely on

other forms of social welfare support, such as Jobseeker’s Allowance etc.,

which are defined as income in calculating rent liability. The Differential Rent

Scheme calculates the total household income and Carer’s Allowance is no

different to other incomes such as the following non-exhaustive list:-

 Income from employment

 Maintenance Payments

 Job Seekers Benefit/Allowance

 Illness Benefit

 Deserted Wives Benefit

 Invalidity Pension

 Disablement Benefit

 Widows Pension

 Injury Benefit

Rental income from its housing stock (circa 5600 units) is a very important

revenue stream for the Council and is projected to amount to in excess of

€19m in 2024. Any downward adjustment to the income criteria would have
---
35

an inevitable impact on the level of services that the Council can provide. In

order to quantify the financial impact of same the Housing Directorate would

need to analyse the rent accounts of 8961 households in some detail – to

include RAS and HAP tenancies, the rents of which are also calculated with

reference to the Differential Rents Scheme. This would represent a massive

body of work, which would take some time to complete.

Income from Carer’s Allowance has been reckonable for rent assessment

purposes for many years, both by Limerick County Council and Limerick City

Council prior to amalgamation, and the joint new authority subsequently. The

adoption of a Differential Rent Scheme is an executive function and the last

significant review took place in February 2020, with the aim of introducing a

standard calculation method across the board for both city and county tenants.

There have been indications for some time that the Minister was considering

the introduction of a standardised National Differential Rents Scheme to be

applied across all local authorities. This aim was included in the 2020

Programme for Government and in the housing action plan, Housing for All. It

appears that moves are now being made to act on this and, by Circular Letter

17/2024 dated the 23rd May 2024 issued by the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage, the Minister has indicated that it is aimed to scope

and develop proposals for a national, standardised scheme in Q4 2024 and, to

assist in this, has instructed all local authorities to provide up to date data in

relation to rents payable by their tenants.

It should also be noted that a similar Notice of Motion was placed on the

Agenda of the full Council meeting of the 27th May 2024 and it was agreed by

Elected Members to refer the Motion to the Housing Strategic Policy

Committee for further consideration. In the light of the foregoing, it is

recommended that this motion should also be referred to the Housing SPC for

further consideration along with any updates on a national Differential Rents

Scheme.

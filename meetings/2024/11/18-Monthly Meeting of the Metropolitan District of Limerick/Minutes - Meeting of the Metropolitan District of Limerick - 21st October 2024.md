unauthorised development to its pre-unauthorised development condition. Unauthorised

development covers a broad range of development types. Some of the cases may result in

retention applications; others may result in the Planning Authority instigating an

enforcement prosecution.

The Planning Authority deals with a large volume and broad range of enforcement cases,

and does not maintain specific records where structures have been demolished.

Should the query concerns a specific enforcement case, this can be discussed directly with

the Planning Authority.

Step 1.

Works commenced on the Limerick City Transport Plan in April 2024 to identify scope &

Objectives. – Step 2.

A pre-Draft Survey was carried out in June 2024 to collect insights on the existing travel

patterns in Limerick City Centre and to explore the views of the people of Limerick as they

relate to potential changes to the existing transport network and the rebalancing of road

space including the introduction of bus priority, improved pedestrian facilities and a safer

cycling environment. We had an excellent response to this survey with 870 respondents. –

Step 3.

We have had extensive liaison with the Mayor of Limerick John Moran and the NTA to

ensure due consideration is given to aligning the Mayoral programme\objectives with the
---
13

objectives of the Transport Plan with the subsequent implication on programme timelines.

We are now at a stage where we are ready to identify & develop Options for the Draft Plan

– Step 4.

While it was an objective at inception to have a draft plan available by Autumn 2024, we

now hope to have the draft plan available in the coming months – Step 5.

Once the draft plan is ready it is intended to commence public consultation to get input

prior to finalisation of the plan Q1- 2025. – Step 6.

The Final Transport Plan will be ready for publication once the Consultation period and

assessment has been completed. - Step 7.

Preparation of the Transport Plan is fully funded and procured by NTA and not Limerick

**REPLY:** Limerick City and County Council have engaged with the local community development

Group regarding the provision of a community centre. The provision of community

infrastructure is challenging and requires a strategic approach for the Metropolitan Area

including Garryowen.

**34**. **Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can the Active Travel***

***Department explain what is happening with the green area by the Moylish roundabout opposite***

***TUS, where the planting resulted in driver visibility issues and had to be cut back. Will this green***

***now be returned to the Parks Department and re-entered into the grass cutting schedule going***

***forward?***

**REPLY**: The Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) outlines the requirements for

visibility splays at junctions and highlights that there is a balance between providing

adequate sight distance and allowing excessive sight distance that might encourage higher

speeds entering the junction. Our assessment is that the sightlines provided at the

roundabout comply with the requirements of DMURS for the design speed at this location.

The grasses and planting was cut as previously planned and in line with seasonal

requirements. The space is underused due to its proximity to the busy road/roundabout

and by carrying out planting, a buffer was created enabling safe usage of the space. The

wildflower planting on open space was carried out in line with Council’s planting objective

to increase biodiversity throughout the city.

**35**. **Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Festival and Events***

***in the tourism survey and other marketing materials, will there be similar avenues of support for***

***non-DAC attractions to access over the coming months/years, ahead of the new tourism strategy***

***being introduced***

**REPLY**: The Tourism Department is currently preparing a new tourism strategy for Limerick.

There are a number of steps in this process including visitor, community and industry

surveys and extensive stakeholder engagement. The tourism strategy will endeavour to

provide a roadmap to enhance Limerick as a dynamic and diverse visitor destination

leveraging Limerick’s rich cultural heritage, vibrant arts scene, historical landmarks, natural

beauty and warm hospitality, taking a holistic view of the entire tourism eco-system. All

tourism attractions and cultural institutions are invited to participate and  contribute

to

the strategic process.

**36.** **Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Festival and Events***

***Department to set out the structure of funding given to events providers and performers and***

***specifically what measures are being put in place to mitigate an overdependence on voluntary***

***festival committees, which has played a part in the decline in festival offerings in Limerick in***

***recent years***

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council makes direct investment in the festival sector through the annual

Festival and Events Scheme. This year’s competitive grant scheme offered the opportunity for

funding under three Strands, for Festival and Events taking place from 1st October 2024 to 30th
---

S2:

Delivery and Programming of Small and Community focused Festivals and Events

S3:

Festival Development and Sustainability

Strand 3 seeks to fund actions to support the long-term development and sustainability of

Festivals/Events. This strand aims to support the development of organisational structures such as

the carrying out of feasibility studies; business plan development; reviews of governance

structures; development of new Festival/Event concepts; marketing and audience development

strategies; brand development; clustering initiatives which support collaboration through shared

resources and/or expertise amongst two or more Festivals/Events.

**37. Question submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what the projected Per Cent***

***following departments: Housing; Roads; Active Travel; Regeneration.***

**REPLY:** The Per Cent for Art scheme is a government initiative whereby 1% of the cost of any

publicly funded capital, infrastructural and building development can be allocated to the

commissioning of art. Effective from 1 January 2020, the investment bands and limits are:

· projects below €5,000,000: 1% of the cost of the project to a maximum of €50,000 (1%

of upper limit)

· projects between €5,000,000 and €20,000,000: 1% of the cost of the project to a

maximum of €125,000 (1% at median)

· projects between €20,000,000 and €50,000,000: 1% of the cost of the project to a

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**46**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery (to be referred to the Climate Action,**

**Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the tree policy be***

***changed to allow trees to be topped and pruned in housing estates.***

Councillor Slattery referred to the issue of overgrown trees in housing estates throughout the city

which are causing hazardous conditions. Members agreed with the importance that trees and

hedging in estates be dealt with where they become an issue in an area.
---
18

The Director of Service, Environment, Climate Action and Shared Services, stated that trees are

normally pruned every year by the Council. However, he will take back Members concerns to the

relevant officials involved.

**38.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee):**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council amend***

***our traffic calming policy to allow the delivery of traffic calming measures where an elected***

***member provides the funding and the necessary petition is signed and submitted by residents.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**39.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Beasley**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council agree to source more hostel beds for individual homeless people.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Beasley and seconded by Councillor Benson.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Beasley referred to the shortage of hostel beds in the city.

Members, in supporting the Motion, stated that some homeless people present to A & E as it is the

only place for them to sleep, and they agreed that a Homeless Liaison Nurse for University Hospital

Limerick would assist in dealing with this issue. They agreed that a support service was also needed

for people coming out of addiction treatment centres such as Cuain Mhuire, etc, as this was also a

part of the wider problem.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council currently operates a number of hostel facilities in conjunction

with our Approved Housing Body partners Novas and Mid-West Simon, details around these

facilities are elaborated upon in more detail later in the response. It is estimated that Limerick City

& County Council will spend €13m in 2024 in the provision of homeless accommodation including

hostel accommodation and related supports.

At the outset it is important to note that many individual homeless people who sleep rough, and

who are frequent users of emergency hostels and shelters, have complex needs around mental

health and addiction and require individualised supports to successfully move from homelessness

to a sustainable tenancy. The Housing First approach has been Government policy for a number of

years. With Housing First, the priority is to support a person who has experienced homelessness

into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around sobriety or

mental health treatment and to continue working intensively with them on these issues once they

are housed. Housing First recognises that a stable home provides the basis for recovery in other

areas. The alignment of housing and health supports means that Housing First is very much a joint

initiative of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of

Health, the Health Service Executive, the criminal justice sector (the Probation Service and Irish

Prison Service), Local Authorities and NGO providers.
---
19

Limerick City and County Council has exceeded its target for Housing First Tenancies and there are

currently 31 tenancies in place supported by Focus Ireland whose team in conjunction with the HSE

team provide the wrap around supports that are required to help manage and sustain these

complex tenancies. There are 5 more Housing First Tenancies planned up to year end 2024.

In most instances the Housing First model with the support of the associated wrap around services

is the optimal long-term solution for individual homeless persons arising from their complex

ongoing needs rather than the provision of additional hostel beds which can lead to cyclical

homelessness and may not be the appropriate solution for the individual homeless person.

Every effort is made to prevent homelessness from occurring and The Homeless Action Team have

a range of services to help prevent homelessness from occurring including as follows

• Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme

• Tenant in Situ Scheme

• HAP Placefinder

• RAS

Unfortunately, there is a small group of individuals whom we try to engage with through our

Outreach team in Ana Liffey and who for various reasons refuse to access hostel accommodation

and other services. The outreach team continue to link in with and engage with these people on a

daily basis in an effort to build relationships and trust in the hope that they will engage with and

avail of services.

As noted, there are a number of Hostel facilities in Limerick to cater for the needs of clients who

present and are eligible for Homeless services. There are a number of supported emergency

accommodation for single adults in Limerick City. Oak Lodge is a 68 bed hostel for men and women

and is operated by Mid-West Simon having increased from a 47 bed provision to a 68 bed provision

in recent years. McGarry House which is managed by Novas has a 30 bed service for men and

women and is funded through Local Authority and HSE funding. Thomond House provides 24 beds

for women only and is operated by Associated Charities Trust. A further number of beds are funded

through Section 10 funding for persons experiencing homelessness with addiction issues at Cuan

Mhuire, Bruree, who run a 12 or 20 week treatment programme. In addition, Cuan Mhuire operate

two transitional houses in Limerick to accommodate homeless persons for 3 to 6 months to prepare

for independent living and secure their own accommodation.

Limerick City and County Council has a large array of placement options for people experiencing

Homelessness and the Homeless Action Team work collaboratively in conjunction with all

stakeholders to ensure no one who is eligible and engages with services is without a bed. There is

also provision for an additional 12 Hostel temporary winter beds which will be active from 28th

November 2024 and which can be increased should the demand require.

It is recognised that the diverse needs of individual homeless people is expanding and the Homeless

Action Team is committed to providing an enhanced targeted response to meet these needs in

conjunction with our HSE partners and other stakeholders. This is under ongoing review.

**40.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council writes***

***to Irish Rail asking for compensation for homes within the Metropolitan District which are***
---
20

***currently experiencing rodent infestation due to works completed along the Limerick to Foynes***

***railway line.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan and seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan stated that she had been contacted by residents of

Lissanalta and Cul Crannagh, Dooradoyle, regarding an increase in rodent infestation since

shrubbery and hedging was removed by Iarnród Eireann at the rear of their houses, and that Irish

Rail needs to take greater responsibility for this issue and address the matter. Members agreed that

this was an issue all along this section of track in the Metropolitan District and that Iarnród Eireann

needed to do more to address this problem.

**41**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that a green roof be***

***incorporated into bus shelters in Limerick City.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Gavan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan outlined the benefits of such green roofs, including

improved air quality, noise prevention and absorption and filtering of rain water. It would also be

a good habitat for pollinators and promote bio-diversity initiatives.

**REPLY**: The current suite of bus shelter structures which are provided by the NTA cannot

incorporate a green roof. The NTA is currently investigating the potential for a green roof

option in future bus shelter structures in urban environments.

**42.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor P. Doyle (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council would present to city centre retailers at no cost parking ticket books in January***

***2025 provided the retailers have paid their 2024 rates in full. I would suggest large retailers who***

***pay more than 20k in rates receive a 100 book of tickets and all other retailers 25 books of tickets***

***to distribute free parking tickets to their customers in Limerick city centre. A provision for such a***

***scheme should also be included in the Councils 2025 budget process.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**43.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas (to be referred to the Travel and**

**Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Mayor and the***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**44.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will move at the next Meeting of**the Metropolitan District of Limerick requesting that the Local***

***Authority liaises**with the National Transport**Authority, Irish Rail and the Department of***

***Transport to explore the option of constructing temporary rail platforms for passenger travelling***

***between Foynes and Limerick for the duration of the 2027 Ryder Cup event at all population***

***centres along the route, such as Adare, Patrickswell and Rosbrien / Dooradoyle.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kilcoyne, seconded by Councillor Pond and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kilcoyne stated that there will be a significant number of

visitors in Limerick for the Ryder Cup in 2027, and that Limerick does not currently have the

infrastructure presently to support the movement of such a large volume of people. Cruise ships

which may be coming into Foynes Port could bring increased footfall into Limerick and he believed

that the present rail transport infrastructure will not support this. He believed that a Task Force

should be put in place to address these issues. Members agreed that rail platforms should also be

retained for use beyond 2027.

**REPLY**: The Transport and Mobility Plan for the Ryder Cup 2027 event is in the early stages of

development with all the named parties. All transport options, including rail, are currently

being considered.

**45**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will move*** ***at the next Meeting*** ***of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council lead the***

***way to Limerick*** ***City and County*** ***becoming an advocate*** ***for a Mental Health Initiative known as***

***the Buddy Bench. This*** ***initiative is to highlight existing benches along the river as a breathing***

***space which would incorporate a positive quote placed on the bench with a QR code which***

***provides local helpline numbers to assist anyone potentially in distress.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Gavan, seconded by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara

and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Gavan referred to the mental health issues experienced by

people. She believed that the introduction of the Buddy Bench initiative would foster connectivity,

while also helping those who may be in distress to link in with voluntary organisations across the

city and receive the necessary help they require.

**REPLY**: The Corporate Services Department will liaise with the Marketing & Communications

Department, along with the Roads, Traffic & Cleansing Department, to examine the

feasibility of developing and installing this information on existing Council owned benches

along the general area of the 3 Bridges route in the Limerick City area.

**47.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolit6an District of Limerick that we contact***

***Waterways Ireland and ask them to attend a meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to***
---
22

***explain why they have not lodged a promised planning application to put in place a***

***comprehensive maintenance plan for the Guinness Canal.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan and seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan.

Councillor Sheehan stated that Waterways Ireland had indicated that, following a meeting on site

in 2023 with Councillors and officials, that they would be lodging a planning application for a

maintenance plan for the Canal before the end of 2023, but that this had not happened and a

planning application had still to be lodged, 12 months later. In the meantime the canal had further

deteriorated and the Members agreed that this was not acceptable, given the huge potential that

the canal has for recreational use for the city.

**REPLY:** Waterways Ireland have responsibility for the maintenance of the Park Canal. They recently

confirmed that Environmental Reports are in final draft for the maintenance works along

the entire Park Canal and that on receipt of the final Environmental reports, that

Waterways Ireland intend to schedule a pre-planning meeting with Limerick City and

County Council, with the intention of submitting a planning submission, for the Limerick

based maintenance works, in the final Quarter of 2024.

Limerick City and County Council recently contacted Waterways Ireland asking them to

attend a meeting with the Elected Members of the Metropolitan District so as to update

the Members, and we will contact them again in order to finalise arrangements for a

meeting.

**48**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick Arts Office***

***establish an online directory of Limerick based professional artists from across all artistic***

***disciplines akin to Clare Arts Office’s online directory at*** ***clarearts.ie***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara, seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hickey-O’Mara stated that Clare Arts Office Online directory

platforms artists from all artistic disciplines, providing a useful way for organisations and

individuals to get in touch with local artists, to build awareness of their work and to link in with

them for future projects. His Motion proposed something similar for Limerick.

**REPLY**: Limerick Arts Office recognises the value in establishing an online directory of Limerick

based professional artists. In response to consultation with artists earlier this year, a

request for additional funding was included in the Arts Council Partnership 2025 funding

application to develop and maintain a Limerick artist network website or online directory.

If funding is approved, the resulting facility would then be open to all Limerick based

professional artists, facilitating connections, introductions and inviting potential

collaboration.

**49**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hickey-O’Mara**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council facilitate***

***temporary pop up galleries to showcase the work of local artists in Council owned properties and***

***vacant spaces in the city centre in the run up to the Christmas season.***
---
23

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hickey-O’Mara, seconded by Councillor

O’Donovan and agreed.

In proposing this Motion, Councillor Hickey-O’Mara stated that this Motion seeks to support artists

through facilitating temporary pop up galleries in the city in the approach to Christmas. He

outlined how the arts was a vibrant sector in Ireland and such a scheme would provide additional

support for what they do. The Members welcomed the Motion and suggested various vacant

properties in the City Centre as possible options for such a scheme.

**REPLY:** The proposal for temporary pop-up galleries could be considered in the context of and

within planning for Christmas in Limerick. This would involve collaboration between

Tourism, Planning & Placemaking, the Arts Office and also with the Development

Management & Placemaking Section, which is currently working on proposals for vacant

shopfronts in the city centre, to include art installations.

There is a need for a lead-in period in order to put in place a scheme which will offer local

artists the opportunity of exhibiting in temporary pop-up galleries, to include building

identification and assessment in terms of suitability from a planning and health and safety

perspective. Accordingly it would be appropriate to develop a programme for delivery in

2025.

The Arts Office would welcome development of such a plan and will work to raise

awareness of the scheme once it has been developed and to assist in selecting artists and

exhibitors for the identified spaces.

The Mayoral Programme includes an action to *conduct a survey of underutilised public*

*spaces and public buildings for potential for temporary, rotating pop-up shops, providing*

*vibrancy and continual novelty to shopping districts in town and the city* (MP87). This survey

when completed may identify suitable vacant spaces in the city centre which could

potentially be used to facilitate temporary pop-up galleries to showcase the work of local

artists.

**50.** **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to the***

***Minister for Education in support of Dyslexia Ireland’s call for young people with dyslexia*** ***and***

***other learning difficulties to be given extra time in state exams.***

In proposing this Motion, Councillor O’Sullivan outlined the importance of supporting this initiative

to give students with dyslexia extra time in state exams, as this was not currently available to them.

The Elected Members were fully supportive of the proposal to the introduction of extra time for

dyslexic students. They also referred to issues affecting students with other forms of neurodiversity,

such as those with a stammer, dyspraxia, ADHD and Autism, as this is currently not available as part

of the supports provided by the Reasonable Accommodations at Certificate Examinations (RACE)

scheme.

Councillor O’Sullivan acknowledged the support received from all the Members for her Motion.

She also agreed with the feedback from the Members in relation to additional amendments. The
---
24

amended Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Sullivan and seconded by Councillor Butler as

follows:

**I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to the**

**Minister for Education in support of Dyslexia Ireland’s call for young people with dyslexia,**

**and other forms of neurodiversity such as stammers, dyspraxia, ADHD and Autism, be given**

**extra time in state exams.**

**51**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Donoghue**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Junction 1 of the***

***M20 is revised to include a direct route into the City Centre at Roxborough to help reduce***

***congestion at Greenfields Road and the junction with the Childers Road.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Donoghue, seconded by Councillor Sheehan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Donoghue referred to the traffic congestion on the Rosbrien

Road and Childers Road. Members also referred to traffic congestion on the roads around the

Crescent Shopping Centre and agreed that the Junction revision would ease congestion issues. The

Members agreed that traffic congestion in all areas need to be looked at, especially prior to the

Ryder Cup in 2027.

**REPLY:**

National and Council policy is to protect the capacity of the national road network and associated

junctions, having regard to all relevant Government guidance. The primary purpose of the national

road network is to provide strategic transport links between main centres of population and

employment. The Rosbrien Interchange was constructed as part of the Limerick Southern Ring

Road Phase II. The interchange provides free flow interchange between M7 (Dublin), N18 (Galway)

M20 (Cork & Tralee) and R526 (Roxboro). The interchange does not facilitate traffic movements

from M20 to R526, Childers Road. The provision of such access was considered at the scheme

development stage and was ruled out as it would cause congestion backing up onto the ring road

network. Access to the city from the M20 is facilitated via N18 Junction 2, Dock Road Interchange

and M7 Junction 29, Ballysimon Interchange.

Objective TR O35 of the Limerick Development Plan states that it is an objective of the Council to

explore

improved accessibility to Limerick Southside, including the possible provision of a motorway

interchange connection from the M20/M7 to limerick Southside subject to –

· The requirement for a Motorway Order;

· Demonstration of consistency with the criteria in Section 2.7 of the Spatial Planning and National

Roads Guidelines for Planning Authorities (2012), including that additional traffic loading can be

satisfactorily accommodated at the junction and on the national road network;

· The special requirements of the tolling scheme (N18 and Limerick Tunnel Scheme) and the

financial implications for the Exchequer of new road schemes in that context shall be evaluated;

· An assessment of environmental impacts

The request to redesign Junction 1 of the M20 to include a direct route into the City Centre is under

review by Limerick City and County Council in line with Development Plan Objective TR 035.

Limerick City and County Council is also exploring other potential route options to improve
---
25

accessibility and connectivity to Limerick Southside. Please see attached correspondence

previously issued by TII with respect to the redesign of the junction at Junction 1, M20.

**52**. **Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that an update be***

***provided on the Mary Street Garda Station site and any other projects / schemes that have been***

***delayed due to reviews by the Mayor including but not limited to housing and property disposals.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor McSweeney and

agreed.

Councillor Kiely, in proposing this Motion, referred to the significant work by officials and Members

which had previously gone into the proposal for the disposal of the former Mary Street Garda

Station, which had been approved at both the Metropolitan District and Full Council Meeting level.

This agreed disposal had been stopped following a decision by the Mayor to review this proposal,

without any consultation or input from the Elected Members. The main aim of all involved had

been to get Mary Street Garda Station building out of dereliction, and this delay will result in the

building remaining in a derelict state for the foreseeable future again.

Some Members also noted that the recent announcement of €200,000 THRIVE funding allocated

to the King’s Island Area of Limerick City where this building is located, is very small compared to

the level of investment that will be required to refurbish this building alone. They agreed that a

decision had been taken by the Elected Representatives of the Council and now that decision had

been reversed without any consultation or engagement and queried the legality of this.

Some Members also noted that the previous Council had asked the Executive to find an alternative

use for the building as it is such a historical building, but none was forthcoming.

**REPLY:**

As you are aware, Limerick City and County Council had previously agreed the disposal of the

former Mary Street Garda Station site for a private development. The developer no longer wishes

to progress with the purchase so the sale will not proceed. This now enables us to assess the new

best optimum use for this public building, in line with other developments in the area and the

Mayoral Programme objective to improve amenities and public realm across King’s Island and

encourage the development of new creative hubs and workshops in this most historic part of our

city.

LCCC has received funding of approximately €200,000 under THRIVE – the Town Centre First

Heritage Revival Scheme - for the King’s Island Area of Limerick City.

THRIVE is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Funding for this project

will be to support the following activities:

-

Enhancement of an existing Integrated Urban Strategy – The King’s Island Walled Town

Framework.

-

Identification of projects that promote the conservation and adaptive reuse of our built

heritage stock while reducing vacancy and dereliction in town centres.

-

Prioritisation, development and specification of project proposals to create a pipeline of

investment-ready built heritage refurbishment, renovation and adaptive reuse projects,

bringing one of them to a stage of readiness where it can be included in a THRIVE Strand 2

application.

**53.** **Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

**Other Business**

The Leas-Chathaoirleach wished the Journalism students from University of Limerick the very best

in their future studies.

He also referred to a fire that had occurred in a business premises in Patrickswell the previous

night, which had resulted in five people losing their job. The Members expressed the hope that this

business would be back in operation soon.

This concluded the Meeting.

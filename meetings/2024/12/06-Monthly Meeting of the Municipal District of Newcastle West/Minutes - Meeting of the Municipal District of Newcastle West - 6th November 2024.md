REPLY:

**(a)**

Part 8 planning was approved for this scheme in 2023 following completion of the

preliminary design. Detailed Design and Land Acquisition is currently underway.

Following this stage, a detailed programme and project cost will be known.

Subject to the necessary lands being acquired it is intended to proceed to tender in

2025 with works to be complete by 2026.

**(b)**

Limerick City and County Council are still awaiting confirmation from TII to allow

progression of this design and any associated applications for funding.

The proposed scheme considers the construction of a footpath/cycle track 149 metres

in length which would join up with the existing designated walkway from the village

of Templeglantine to the junction of the N21/L7055. This Scheme will facilitate

pedestrian connectivity to Templeglantine GAA Club and improve the junction safety

by providing a traffic calming measure.

TII have commented that the recent pavement scheme has also addressed safety

concerns at this location.

The cost associated with delivering the proposed improvement scheme identified

above is estimated to be €93,813.72 incl. VAT.

Limerick City and County Council will continue to follow up on this scheme and provide

an update once available.

**(c), (d)** Since our update to you, on the N21 Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West schemes, for the

September Meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West we have continued

through Phase 3 of TII’s Project Management Guidelines which includes design and

preparation of statutory guidelines.

Our design team are finalising the design to consider additional design requirements

including consideration of the active travel facility cross section and the impacts of the

2023 speed limit review. We have also carried out additional environmental surveys

and the results have been fed back into the design.

We are on target to publish a further design update early in 2025 and this update will

outline the road alignments for each of the schemes and will provide timeline

estimates for the progression of the N21 Abbeyfeale and N21 Newcastle West

schemes.

We will not have detailed costings until the design has been completed and the

required business cases are prepared in accordance with Public Spending Code

requirements.

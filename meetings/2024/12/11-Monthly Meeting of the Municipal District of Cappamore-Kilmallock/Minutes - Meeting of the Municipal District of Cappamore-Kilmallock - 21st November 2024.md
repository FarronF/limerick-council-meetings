QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

on progress with the refurbishment and development of Cappamore Fire Station.

**REPLY:**

Work continues on the refurbishment and redevelopment of Cappamore Fire Station with a

Design Team led by D. Fallon Consulting Engineers working in conjunction with Limerick Fire

and Emergency Services. An update on progress on this project is set out hereunder.

The following surveys and investigations have been completed on site:

·

Asbestos demolition survey

·

Opening up works

·

·

Geotechnical (ground conditions) sampling and survey

·

Mechanical and electrical surveys of the existing installation including the boiler

servicing the community centre

The architectural elements for the new build and refurbishment are substantially complete.

Civil and structural packages are expected from the Design Team before the end of

November. The full Bill of Quantities for the new build and refurbishment will be complete

by the end of December. Fire Safety Certificate and Disability Access Certificate applications

are complete and will be lodged with the Building Control Authority this month.

A meeting has taken place with a local provider in respect of temporary accommodation

from which the fire station can operate while works are ongoing, and plans for providing a

service during this time are being prepared by the local fire service management team.

The present focus is on the relocation of the boiler that services the community centre,

which is currently located within the existing fire station building. This is a necessary enabler

to allow the project to proceed. The Design Team is preparing a tender pack for this, so that

a contractor can be procured and appointed to carry out the work. It is planned to have this

tender ready before the end of December and issued in January 2025.

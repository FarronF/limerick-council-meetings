**REPLY**: The Kings Island Walled Town Framework is currently being finalised, this is a non-statutory

Framework and serves as guidance for the transformation of this strategically significant

area of Limerick City. The Framework has undergone significant public engagement in

accordance with the New European Bauhaus. Based on the public engagement, the

Framework identifies the Orchard site as a key site within the area, and is cognisant of the

car-parking requirements for King Johns Castle, the importance of the archaeological

features of the site including the line of the City wall and the potential to explore

opportunities to utilise the Fosse (the existing moat around the city wall) as a Sustainable

urban Drainage Feature (SuDS). Forming a new urban blue/green connector, the proposals

would provide an opportunity to connect various urban/green spaces along with public

realm improvements, creating an amenity for the local community and visitors alike.

Arising from the Framework there may be a change to the Orchard site as currently

proposed.

S179A planning for Cosgrave Park Phase 2 housing is about to be submitted for 20nr units.

It is envisaged that a contractor will be appointed in Q3-2025 with handover of units

expected mid 2027.

The design for Pineview Gardens is currently being reviewed with a view to further

discussion with stakeholders in the coming weeks.

The design for Cliona Park Phase 4 is currently being reviewed with a view to further

discussion with stakeholders in Q1-2025.

In 2018, Limerick City and County Council received funding under the Catchment Flood Risk

Assessment & Management (CFRAMS) program to advance this comprehensive flood relief

project. This large-scale scheme covers significant areas of Limerick City and surrounding

locations, including parts of County Clare.

Throughout 2024, considerable progress has been made, notably completing hydraulic

modelling and developing flood extent maps for Limerick City and its environs. The options

development phase is underway, incorporating public realm enhancements into the design.

By Q3 2025, we anticipate having an emerging preferred option available for public display.

Looking ahead, our focus in the coming year will include public consultation, continued

extensive geotechnical investigations, and detailed ecological surveys, all of which are

crucial for refining the options and advancement of the project. Further information on the

project is available via the FRS website at https://www.floodinfo.ie/frs/en/limerick/home/

**17.Question submitted by Councillor U. Gavan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick*** ***has consideration been***

***given to the use of Cleeve’s Factory as a Limerick version of the Marina Market*** ***– with combined***

**REPLY**: Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development DAC (LTT) purchased the Cleeves Riverside

Quarter site (Cleeves) from Limerick City & County Council in December 2020. Since then,

Cleeves has been the subject of detailed site analysis, Options Appraisal including Multi

Criteria Analysis and a Preliminary Business Case which in turn allowed a non-statutory

Master Plan to be developed for this strategic urban site. The Master Plan was published in

October 2023 and identifies five development zones across 10 acres with a significant new

public realm centred around the Flaxmill which is the historic core of Cleeves. The Master

Plan provides for several uses including residential, commercial/educational and mixed use.

Some of the spaces identified as mixed-use may be suitable for cultural/community/food

uses such as the Marina Market style events. The Master Plan ensures a cohesive and

permeable development that can be delivered across a number of phases. Since the Master

Plan was completed LTT have progressed with designs for the first phase of the

development that includes the residential zones, public realm and the Flaxmill.  As LTT

progress through the formal design stages, the evolving strategy for the Flaxmill Building

includes for a publicly accessible mixed use at ground floor level that could accommodate

restaurant/bar/music venue or gallery space with the potential of educational use on the

upper floors.

with the Planning Department of Limerick City & County Council around their future plans

**REPLY**: The Litter Enforcement team take all practical measures for the prevention, control and

correct disposal of litter in the city. Two Environmental Inspectors are assigned to the city

centre to patrol for breaches of the Litter Pollution and Waste Management Acts and the

Segregation, Storage and Presentation of Household and Commercial Waste Bye laws 2019.

They issue warnings and fines to householders and commercial business where breaches of

the regulations are found in the laneways and other thoroughfares. Where breaches are

not rectified or fines paid the Council take legal proceedings against the offending

household or business. Environmental inspectors work in close collaboration with the

rejuvenation is being trialled by the City Centre team and will include possible bin storage

solutions for the laneways.

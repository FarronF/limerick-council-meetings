queries were raised by Members:
---

 Councillor O’Brien queried if the objection lodged against plans to raise the height

of the railway bridge in Adare would delay the project. Mr. Vaughan advised the

objection is currently at the planning appeal stage and a decision from An Bord

Pleanála is expected in February 2024 and added while it would not delay the

project it would have consequences in raising the track in the future.

 Councillor O’Donoghue asked how crossings for local wildlife would be handled

and also how many farmers with land along the railway line were impacted. Mr

Vaughan advised a number of underpasses have already been installed

successfully and added a badger sett had been identified and also relocated

successfully. He further advised suitable fencing had been erected along all routes

to allow wildlife to move freely along the railway corridor. Mr. Vaughan concluded

saying all the 25 – 35 farmers on the route would be facilitated with

accommodation works.

 Councillor Keary queried if the track located at Mungret would be rehabilitated.

Mr. Vaughan advised Mungret is not currently in the scope for a freight corridor.

Councillor Keary then asked for an update on an automatic crossing for a farmer

crossing cattle at Kilknockan cul-de-sac. Mr. Vaughan advised he would follow up

on this request and revert to Councillor Keary in due course.

 Councillor Collins expressed alarm that the level of the bridge at the River Maigue

in Adare would be kept at its current level and asked what impact and cost would

be associated with carrying out works in the future to raise the bridge. Mr.

Vaughan advised as this part of the project is currently delayed due to a planning

issue provisions have been made to raise the bridge at a later date without too

much disruption.

It was agreed Item 6 on the Agenda would be taken next.

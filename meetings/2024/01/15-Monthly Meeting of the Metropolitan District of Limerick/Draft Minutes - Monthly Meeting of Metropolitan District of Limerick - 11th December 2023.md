They referred to Christmas events in other cities in Ireland and agreed that Limerick needed to

increase its offering for Christmas 2024 to ensure that it continued to be an attractive destination

for Christmas 2024. They noted that the potential of commercial sponsorship could also be

explored, as well as looking at having a formal turning on ceremony for Christmas lights. The

***(a) How many of these properties do Limerick City and County Council*** ***pay a levy on;***

***(b) Levies that are collected on derelict properties are used for what purpose.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council continues to identify vacant homes and derelict sites by

regular surveys completed throughout the local authority’s administrative area. Public

representatives, members of the public and local community groups also bring such

unproductive properties to the attention of the Council.

A full copy of the Derelict Sites Register maintained by the Council pursuant to section 8 of

the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 (as amended), is available for inspection during office hours at

the Property Management Department, Merchants Quay, Limerick, or may be downloaded

in summary from www.limerick.ie/council

a) The Council currently hasthe particulars of land in439 no. cases entered in the Register**.**

Of these, there are 131 no. cases where the land is currently in the ownership of LCCC.

These cases include properties which are:

 at sale agreed stage between LCCC and new owners pending legal completion

 in a renovation programme for social housing

 retained for community/tourism or other uses.

 held by LCCC pending an arbitration process

It is the intention to dispose of the majority of the acquired sites to new owners, or they

are included in a Council-led development programme.

b) The Council charges a Levy on properties that are entered in the Register and for which

a market valuation has been determined. The Levy is charged annually and is equal to

7% of the market value determined. The Levy continues to be charged until the site

ceases to be ‘derelict’ within the meaning of section 3 to the Derelict Sites Act, 1990.

All levies collected are used in connection with running the derelict sites process from

initial inspection through to acquisition and de-risking, to selling to new owners.

Entitled parties will also lodge claims for compensation due the acquisition of their sites

and these must be paid by the Council.

***Council has considered or has plans to install a Pedestrian Crossing near Monaleen GAA Pitch on***

***Schoolhouse Road that would allow children and adults safe access to the grounds while crossing***

***this extremely busy road.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Road’s Department will examine potential funding

avenues for a possible pedestrian crossing scheme near Monaleen GAA Pitch on

Schoolhouse Road, possibly through a Low-Cost Safety or Active Travel scheme. If a funding

application is successful a suitable design and delivery will take place, which will possibly

be subject to a Section 38 public consultation and a road safety audit.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if Limerick City and County***

***Council has considered or has plans for a traffic safety scheme at Bengal Terrace, Old Cork Road.***

currently on the list of schools awaiting works.

We are currently working with schools in Limerick who are on Round 1 and Round 2 of the

programme. Once these schools have been supported, then subsequent schools will be

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick as to what plans have***

***Limerick City and County Council in place for speed reducing measures for the Ballinacurra Road.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Roads Department currently does not have plans to

introduce new speed reducing measures for the Ballinacurra Road. A traffic survey and

assessment on the Ballincurra Road was completed in February 2023. No significant speed

violations were identified; however the Roads Department will keep this area under review.

It is important to also recognise the Council has installed driver feedback signage on this

road and speed vans have regularly been assigned by the Gardaí to this particular area.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan**District of Limerick if Limerick City and County***

***Council has any plans to widen footpaths near the ESB Networks Offices at Rosbrien approaching***

***the junction of the Rosbrien Road and Punches Cross.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council Roads Department currently does not have plans to widen

footpaths on the R858 Rosbrien road from the ESB Networks offices to the Punches cross

junction. This road currently accommodates two-way traffic and footpath widths are

restricted due to the close proximity of the front of existing residential properties to the

edge of the road carriageway. Due to the existing topography and front properties layouts

in this location, it is not currently possible to widen footpaths in this particular area without

setting back property boundaries which would be subject to land purchase agreements,

planning and funding availability.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***establishing of the community liaison committee for the Mungret / Raheen / Dooradoyle area as***

***stipulated in the planning conditions in respect to Irish Cement.***

**REPLY**: An Bord Pleanala in granting permission to Irish Cement Ltd. for the development for the

use of alternative fuels and alternative raw materials at the Limerick Cement Factory,

included conditions requiring the establishment of a Community Liaison Committee with

the responsibility to administer a community gain fund to support facilities and services in

the general catchment area.

The Committee as set out in An Bord Pleanla’s conditions is advised to comprise of seven

members having an independent chairperson, two local community representatives, two

elected members of the planning authority, one official of the planning authority and one

representative from the operator of the cement works.

Irish Cement Ltd. has made a compliance submission and is engaging with the Council on

these conditions. The Council is reviewing best practice on models of governance and will

be seeking the establishment of the Committee in 2024.

***Council to clarify why foliage from gardens, etc., including grass, is not being accepted from small***

***contractors who are bringing same to Mungret Recycling Centre.***

**REPLY**: We regret that currently only domestic green waste can be accepted at our Recycling

facilities at Mungret, Newcastle West and Kilmallock. Unfortunately, commercial green

waste cannot be accepted at our facilities at this time due to capacity issues at the Parks

depot in Mungret where the green waste is processed. This situation will remain under

continual review. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause to our commercial

customers.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the Options***

***Report prepared following the close out of the Condell Road Section 38 Process which was to***

***examine the Clonmacken and Coonagh roundabouts to include the active travel infrastructure***

***committed in 2020 for the section of road between these two roundabouts which currently does***

***not even have a footpath.***

**REPLY**: A Needs Assessment Report to determine project goals was issued to the National Transport

Authority (NTA) in February of 2023 and did not progress to “Options Selection”

Phase.  However, the section of Condell Road between the Clonmacken and Coonagh

roundabouts is included in the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy

(LSMATS) as a secondary cycle route and would be a long-term goal for the Active Travel

Department for provision of a cycle and pedestrian link.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a Housing Development***

***Residential Pipeline of estimated delivery in Limerick City North to include all state-funded***

***work to date.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council is in the final stages of making an appointment to the

position of Nighttime Economy Advisor and it is anticipated that the successful candidate

will commence employment in early 2024.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what is the processing time***

***for approval for Housing Adaptation Grants, Mobility Aids Grants and Housing Aid for Older***

***People Grants in each Electoral Area in Limerick City and County Council.***

**REPLY:** Housing Adaptation Grants, Mobility Aids Grants and Housing Aid for Older People Grants

are administered by the 4 Metropolitan/Municipal Districts for their respective

administrative area.

There is a common application form for all the above referenced grants, however a Doctor’s

Certificate is required for both the Housing Adaptation Grant and Mobility Aid Grant, a

certificate can also be provided for a Housing Aid for Older People Grant if it is required for

an urgent medical condition. This certification allows for the application/works to be

prioritised as Priority 1,2 or 3. The priorities are outlined hereunder: -

Priority 1 works given their urgency are processed immediately and are typically processed

within a 2-to-3-week timeframe; however, in some cases Priority 1 works can be processed

within days if there is an urgency to the application i.e. terminal illness.

All other grant applications (Priority 2 & 3) are typically processed within a 6-to-8-week

timeframe, where we receive complete application forms. However, some applications

require the input of Occupational Therapists reports or may be missing particular details

regarding the applicant in respect of household income, Local Property Tax compliance etc;

(Image omitted)
---
8

this can extend the processing time beyond 6 to 8 weeks.

Due to the increased volume of applications, Limerick City and County Council notes in its

correspondence to applicants that the process can take up to 14 weeks; this is an indicative

timeframe and generally does not reflect what happens in practice when we receive fully

completed application forms. The timeframe noted in correspondence is purposely

conservative in order to allow the Council focus its resources on Priority 1 & 2 applications

and deal with any issues that may arise.

Limerick City & County Council administers a significant volume of grant applications

annually. In 2022, the Council approved 842 applications in total; in 2023 the Council has

approved a total of 945 applications up to the end of November 2023 and we envisage this

no. will exceed 1,000 by the end of the year. The 2023 grant approvals to date represents a

12% increase on the full year approval figure for 2022.

The increased approval numbers accommodated in 2023 was supported by a request from

Limerick City and County Council for additional funding beyond our approved budget of

€3.8m. The additional budget request was approved by the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage and has provided Limerick City and County Council with an

overall budget in excess of €5m for 2023 which the Council provided increased match

funding towards from its own resources.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council writes***

***to the National Transport Authority asking them to encourage the greater use of the taxi bay on***

***Sarsfield Street in the city centre, and that Limerick City and County Council and An Garda***

***Síochána also be requested to monitor and enforce any illegal parking in this bay.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Benson stated that the taxi bay on Sarsfield Street provided

easier access to the northside of the city and should be monitored for illegal parking to ensure it

can fully operate as a taxi bay.

**REPLY**: The NTA’s role is limited to offering advice, guidelines and funding to the local authorities.

They do not direct or encourage taxi operators to use particular taxi ranks.

The Council will liaise with An Garda Síochána to request that they monitor and enforce

illegal parking in this taxi rank.

Limerick City and County Council’s Traffic Wardens regularly monitor this taxi rank and

frequently issue fixed penalty notices to illegally parked vehicles.

***and County Council would close the Greenway during nighttime hours.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Pond, seconded by Councillor Slattery and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Pond stated that the Castletroy Greenway was an excellent

amenity and consideration should be given to closing the Greenway at the same time as closing

Parks to try and assist in eliminating anti-social behaviour. Some Members noted that the Greenway

was used in the evening times by cyclists and walkers and that the Gardai had agreed to introduce

cycle patrols in the Metropolitan District so these patrols, along with possible CCTV measures, could

address any issues.

**REPLY**: Public enforcement is a matter for An Garda Síochána. Limerick City & County Council will

engage with all relevant stakeholders to seek amicable solutions.

**19.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council consider providing additional funding to grit city centre footpaths and make salt***

***available to city centre residents association for their safety during cold weather.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Benson and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan referred to the lack of funding for gritting footpaths

and the importance of ensuring that footpaths are accessible, for children, the disabled and older

people.

**REPLY**: With approximately 4,000 kms of roadway in County Limerick, it is not possible to treat all

roads as part of the normal winter maintenance programme. Priority is given to the National

Route and strategic regional route system, which carries the most intensive volumes of

commuter traffic. The winter maintenance programme for 2023/2024 sets out the priority

treatment routes, when resources are available and what additional treatments can be

carried out in exceptional circumstances.

It is not possible to include the provision of salt in such areas but in exceptional

circumstances, such as prolonged events or specific warnings it may be possible to carry out

surface treatment on the basis of need and the availability of resources.

The Senior Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing stated that a Workshop could be arranged in

the New Year to consider possible additional measures to address the issues raised.

**21.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council write to***

damaged in some areas by heavier vehicles.

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that consideration be***

***given to the provision of additional resources to address the processing time for Housing***

***Adaptation Grants, Mobility Aids Grants and Housing Aid for Older People Grants in the***

***Metropolitan District area.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor McSweeney and

agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Kiely referred to the importance of processing grants in a

timely manner across all the Districts in the local authority area to ensure that people could avail

of grant assistance without undue delays.

**REPLY**: Limerick City & County Council receives an annual budget for private grants from the

Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage. This grant award generally remains

consistent with previous years and Limerick City & County Council has in recent years

received an initial grant award of €3.8m i.e. exchequer funding of €3,052,350 and Limerick

City and County Council match funding of 20% in the amount of €763,088.

Should the Council receive a significantly higher volume of applications a request can then

be made for additional funding to the Department. This was the case in both 2022 and 2023.

In 2022, the Council approved 842 applications in total; in 2023 the Council has approved a

total of 945 applications up to the end of November 2023 and we envisage this no. will

exceed 1,000 by the end of the year. The 2023 grant approvals to date represents a 12%
---
12

increase on the full year approval figure for 2022.

The Council has experienced an upward trajectory in the volume of grant applications we

are receiving and we are grateful for the increased budget allocation that we are in receipt

of from the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage to support the

increased no. of approvals we are able to process.

We are consistently reviewing our work practices to ensure that we are achieving

efficiencies in processing times and using our resources effectively to ensure grant

applications are turned around as quickly as possible. We have recently introduced a

number of measures to reduce the no. of pre and post visits that are required by our

inspections team in order to ensure we can meet the increased capacity, these measures

include as follows:-

1) we have introduced a self-certification post works process for certain grant types

2)  we have requested that any applications for new windows and doors would be

accompanied by photographs which will allow for a quicker turnaround

3) The introduction of an online application form for private grants this year will also

improve our efficiencies in this area and will allow for quicker processing times for

private grants

We will continue to monitor the number of applications we are processing, this is reported

to Members monthly in the Chief Executive reports and if there is any significant change to

the processing times, we will review our available resources that we have allocated to this

Department.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council consider the introduction of a multi-location Parking Permit for certain approved***

***organisations operating within the City Centre area, so as to enable them to park their vehicle at***

***various locations throughout the city in order to deliver essential and important services to***

***people in the City Centre area.***

The Notice of Motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Novak Uí

Chonchúir and agreed.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Hartigan highlighted the need for a multi-location parking

permit for approved organisations that park their vehicles throughout the city to allow flexibility

for a very limited number of organisations to operate in the city centre.

**REPLY**: The existing provisions for permit parking in Limerick City are restricted to those for:

1) Disabled persons parking Card\Permit (& EU Parking Card for People with Disabilities).

2) Residential Parking Permits, on proof of residency.

Currently there are no other regulatory provisions in place in Limerick for requests that fall

outside of these criteria.
---
13

It is also important to consider the amenity and economic value of street space. Any

decisions that might reduce availability of our street space need to align with economic and

mobility objectives as set out in the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 and Limerick

Shannon Metropolitan Area Study (LSMATS).

Members supported the Motion and agreed that it should be referred to the Travel and

Transportation Strategic Policy Committee for further discussion.

**27. Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

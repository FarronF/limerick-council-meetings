Transportation and Mobility Directorate

To Receive Presentation from Central Services on Part VIII Lees

Cross Junction Improvement Scheme.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Senior Executive Engineer, Roads, Traffic and Cleansing, to

the Meeting.

The Senior Executive Engineer addressed the Meeting and gave an update to the Members

on Lees Cross Junction Improvement Scheme.

He stated that Limerick City and County Council are developing the existing preliminary design

for Lees Cross Junction Improvement Scheme through Part 8 planning. He also stated that

Lees Cross is a very open, five-arm junction located approximately 4.5km south of Ballingarry

in County Limerick and is on the border between the Newcastle West and Adare-Rathkeale

Municipal Districts.

He referred to the main route through the junction which is the R520 – R518 carriageway,

connecting Newcastle West town with the N20 and Kilmallock town. He stated that the

carriageway intersects with the R518 from the north-west, the L1210 from the north and the

L1211 from the south.

He also stated that following a detailed application in 2022 the Department provided €25,000

to progress the scheme through planning in 2023. He made reference to a number of issues
---

identified with the current junction layout including sightlines onto the R518/R520 main

carriageway from the R518 Ballingarry road, the L1210 Granagh Road and the L1211 which

are insufficient. He stated that the existing junction layout lacks definition, especially to the

north, between the R518 Ballingarry road and the L1210 Granagh road. He stated that it is

not clear to road users approaching the junction where the priority lies, particularly for those

travelling south on the R518 where the road joins the L1210 immediately prior to the R520-

R518.

He referred to the proposed design which seeks to separate the existing five arm junction into

two staggered T-junctions. He also referred to both Appropriate Assessment (AA) and

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) screening reports which were undertaken as part of

the planning process.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that the plans and particulars of the proposed

development were available for inspection from Thursday, 14th September, 2023 up to and

including Thursday, 12th October, 2023 and that submissions and observations were to be

made on or before Thursday, 26th October, 2023. He outlined to the Members the various

submissions which were received and the response of the Chief Executive on this matter. He

stated that Limerick City and County Council has spoken to the landowners in the area and

that a very positive response has been received from the landowners. The Senior Executive

Engineer made reference to the various timelines in progression of the project and stated

that it is planned to bring the scheme to the Full Council Meeting in January 2024. He also

stated that subject to negotiations and appointments, Limerick City and County Council will

be applying for funding for the construction of the scheme in 2025.

The Members welcomed the proposed improvement works at Lees Cross Junction and

thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for the presentation. The Members referred to a

number of matters including the volume of traffic using the junction, issue of safety at the

junction, timeframe for completion of the project and cost of the project. In replying, the

Senior Executive Engineer stated that the approximate cost of the Lees Cross Junction

Improvement Scheme is €1.3M.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.
---
12

REPLY:

The intention of Limerick City and County Council is to take this area in charge

and works to solve these issues are planned for early 2024.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle requested that drainage and resurfacing works be

carried out to the laneway connecting Bishop Street to the Desmond Complex. In replying,

including Councillors Collins, Sheahan and Scanlan.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will move at the next*** **Meeting what steps are the Council taking to provide parking in**

**Newcastle West. We have recently lost 25 car park spaces in Aldi Car park. Going from 105**

**spaces which they received in the original planning permission, this is reduced down to**

**about 80. Also we have lost parking in other parts of the town, Dooley's new supermarket**

**extension. It is incumbent on the Council to provide adequate parking within walking of**

**Square.**

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

In conjunction with the public realm plan Limerick City and County Council can

look at alternative parking arrangements and consider options available to

them. The Municipal District office will be working with the local Community

Groups and Businesses in co-operation with the Economic Development

Department over the coming months on developing a public realm plan for the

town.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Ruddle referred to the loss of car parking spaces in the

19. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will move at the next Meeting that*** ***Limerick City and County Council carry out a Road Safety***

***audit on the R523 from The Pike, Ardagh to the Kerry bounds, specifically speeding through***

***the villages and the following areas (a) The Commons, Ardagh, (b) Glenagore, Athea to***

***Athea village and (c) Athea village to the Kerry County Bounds. This audit should look at***

***speed limit reductions, driver feedback signs and average speed cameras.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.
---
13

REPLY:

A road safety audit will likely not comment on the speed limit of any section of road as there

is a legislative process which must be followed and would be outside the ultimate control of

the Road Safety Auditor/ Local Authority to approve.

For speed limit appeals the Speed Limit Appeals Procedure, sets out the mandatory procedure

that must be utilised by a Roads Authority or National Panel when a member of the public or

other interested party raises an objection to a specific speed limit contained within a Local

Authority’s current Special Speed Limit Bye-laws. Appeals are processed in line with the

procedure and any decision with respect to any appeal will be made in line with the Speed

Limit Guidelines. We are aware that the Department are in the process of reviewing the

national guidance with respect to speed limits and following recent correspondence from the

Department of Transport, Local authorities are due to provide a briefing with respect to the

timeline and potential changes in this guidance.

Currently there is no legislation with respect to the introduction of average speed cameras on

National, Regional or Local roads. We are aware that TII are currently examining the

legislation with the view of the introduction of average speed cameras in national roads. The

N21 is being considered by the TII as a potential location for a trial for average speed cameras

if introduced, however this has to be decided by the TII.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan requested that a road safety audit which would

include speed limit reductions, driver feedback signs and average cameras to be carried out

at the above location and if the R523 could be considered as a pilot scheme. In replying, the

Senior Executive Engineer stated that discussions has taken place with Central Services but

agreed to discuss this matter further with Central Services.

The following items were also raised.

An update was sought on the re-instatement of a Further Education and Training Centre in

Abbeyfeale and in replying the Meetings Administrator stated that contact has been made

with the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board who has confirmed that a Further

Education and Training Centre is currently being sought for Newcastle West and that

Abbeyfeale would be incorporated into this Centre.

The maintenance of the paths and slipways at Glin Pier was raised and to discussions which

are to take place with the Water Safety Development Officer on this matter.

An update was sought on the carrying out of an urgent clean-up of Sharwood Estate,

Newcastle West.

Reference was also made to the deterioration of roads over the last number of years and to

the number of tar patchers in the District. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated
---
14

that there are two patching units in the District and that the street sweeper is in the District

five days per week for November, December, 2023, January 2024. He also stated that

Limerick City and County Council has engaged the services of CES Ltd., to carry out a full survey

of the storm water sewers in the District.

An update was sought on remedial works to be carried out at Páirc Luachra, Abbeyfeale,

Planning, Environment and Place-Making

Draft Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2024-2030

Circulated, report of the Director, Planning, Environment and Place-Making dated 10th

November, 2023, enclosing a copy of the Chief Executive’s Report dated 10th November, 2023,

on the submissions received as part of the public consultation on the Draft Patrickswell Local

Area Plan 2024-2030.

In accordance with Section 177 of the Local Government Act, 2001 (as amended)

Councillor McSweeney removed himself from the meeting for the duration of this discussion,

declaring that land within the red line boundary is owned by a connected person.

With the permission of the Mayor and on the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J),

seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon, it was agreed to adjourn for 15 minutes.

On resumption, and following a discussion and consideration of the Draft

Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2024-2030 and the Chief Executives Report dated 10th of

November 2023 on the submissions received during the public consultation on the Draft

Patrickswell Local Area Plan 2024-2030, it was proposed to make the Draft Patrickswell

Local Area Plan 2024 – 2030, subject to the Chief Executive recommendations, report dated

the 10th of November subject to the following amendments:

Amendment proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Kiely.

**Motion 1:**I will move to amend Table 7.3 Active Travel Measures and Prioritise, Action AT1,

Proposed Link Type/Active Mode Priority, to read “Cycle Infrastructure” instead of

“Segregated Cycle Lane” and in line with the above amend objective SMTO2 part B to read

Support the provision of further cycle infrastructure through Patrickswell Village linking into

the existing segregated cycle track along the R526 to Limerick City and link into proposed

active travel infrastructure as part of the N/M20 Cork to Limerick Project, the Patrickswell to

Charleville Greenway, and the Rathkeale to Limerick Greenway.

**Reason:** In the interest of road safety and to ensure the appropriate provision of cycle

infrastructure, in line with the current active travel scheme.

The amendment proposed by Councillor Butler and seconded by Councillor Kiely was

approved.---
15

Amendment proposed by Councillor Talukder and seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.

**Motion 2:** I will move at the next meeting that the Development Boundary of the Draft

Patrickswell Local Area Plan be extended to incorporate lands (0.42 Hectares) as shown on

the accompanying map at Ballyanrahan East, Patrickswell. Co. Limerick. The subject lands

which are located within 600m of the village core, in a reduced speed zone and served by a

public footpath and public lighting are to be zoned ‘Residential Serviced Sites’ and will

accommodate 2 – 4 dwellings over the life of the plan

**Reason:** There are no ‘new’ lands identified in the Draft LAP for serviced sites in the village

and where it is a policy objective of the Local Authority in the CDP that lands are to be made

available in settlements to counter the proliferation of ‘one off’ houses. In addition, the

existing ‘serviced sites’ lands to the east of the village (which benefits from a grant of

permission) are located in close proximity to the motorway, remote from the village and

without pedestrian infrastructure.

The amendment proposed by Councillor Talukder and seconded by Councillor

O’Hanlon was approved.

**Resolution**

Proposed by: Councillor J. Sheahan

Seconded by: Councillor K. O’Hanlon

And Resolved

“That having considered the Chief Executive’s Report dated 10th November, 2023, on

the submissions received as part of the public consultation on the Draft Patrickswell Local

Area Plan 2024-2030, that Limerick City and County Council make the Draft Patrickswell Local

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Newcastle West -

Councillors J. Sheahan (Proposer), M. Collins, F. Foley, L. Galvin, T. Ruddle,

J. Scanlan

**We will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Government to review GDPR**

**(General Data Protection Regulation) rules regarding housing and giving out information to**

**us as Councillors/Directors of this Council.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor Galvin,

and adopted.

**REPLY:**

This Motion was previously raised by an Elected Member and responded to at

the meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West on 6th September,

2023.

The Council, including the Housing Directorate, are committed to meeting all

relevant Data Protection, privacy and security requirements, whether

originating from legal, regulatory or contractual obligations and is committed

to protecting the rights and privacy of individuals in accordance with current

Data Protection legislation.

Councillors and other elected public representatives are data controllers in

their own right. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data

Protection Act, 2018, clearly set out the responsibility of the Council and

Elected Representatives to manage personal data securely. Section 40 of the

Data Protection Act, 2018, specifically refers to elected representatives making

representations to organisations seeking personal data.

The Council, having regard to the significant requirements under the Data

Protection legislation, has a dedicated Data Protection Officer and Data

Protection Unit to ensure data governance protocols are embedded

throughout the organisation and specifically within each Department of

Limerick City and County Council.

The Motion submitted would require a change to the General Data Protection

Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act, 2018, which took effect in May

2018.

Should this Notice of Motion be passed, we would recommend that we write

to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and that a

copy of this Motion is forwarded to them.

Councillor Keary also proposed than an audit is carried out of all Notice of Motions

adopted during meetings that took place in 2023 and the implementation of these Notice of

Motions. This was seconded by Councillor Galvin and agreed.---

**Climate and Communications, Mr. Eamon Ryan, TD, asking when the wind energy**

**development guidelines will be revised and updated.**

On the proposal of Councillor Teskey, seconded by Councillor O’Brien, the Motion was

adopted.

It was also agreed to circulate the Motion to all Local Authorities for support.

J. Sheahan

**We will move at the next Meeting that this Council calls on Uisce Éireann to implement a**

**notification system similar to the ESB when planned disruptions are taking place and that**

**the Government do likewise.**

On the proposal of Councillor Ruddle, seconded by Councillor Galvin, the Motion was

adopted.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Government to consider**

**implementing a grant for security lighting for the elderly living outside the towns and**

**villages that are not publicly lit.**

On the proposal of Councillor Galvin, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J), the Motion

was adopted.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council endorse the Amnesty International report**

**entitled ‘Israel’s Apartheid Against Palestinians: A Cruel System of Domination and a Crime**

**Against Humanity,’ and support the** **Palestinian BDS Movement as a show of solidarity with**

**the Palestinian people.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan and seconded by Councillor

Talukder.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan highlighted the horrific events that are

happening in Gaza, and asked the Council to support the Amnesty International Report.

**Suspension of Standing Orders 4:** The Mayor drew attention to the time, which was

approaching 5.30 p.m., and on the proposal of Councillor Ryan (E), seconded by Councillor

Butler, Standing Order 4 was suspended in order to complete the agenda.---

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council urgently increase emergency**

**accommodation capacity in both the city and county, particularly to cater for the shortage**

**of bed spaces for single men and women.**

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Benson and seconded by Councillor Collopy.

**REPLY:**

Limerick City and County Council has increased beds in emergency

accommodation in Limerick this winter. In September 2023, the Council had

capacity for 137 singles. As of 23rd November, there is capacity for 159

individuals. If a cold or extreme weather warning is called, the Council will be

in a position to provide further additional spaces as necessary.

The Street Outreach Team has increased its hours and capacity also to engage

with any customers who may be sleeping rough and supporting them to access

beds, addition and mental health supports. The Homeless Unit is continually

working with service providers to bring beds into use for customers who are

presenting to HAT seeking a service and who are deemed as homeless in

accordance with Section 2 of the Housing Act, 1988.

In addition to emergency bed provision, Limerick City and County Council will

allocate a further six Housing First units to customers before Christmas

therefore creating not only long-term tenancies, but also creating vacancies in

hostels.

To note: 83 individuals have moved on from emergency accommodation this

year from January to September, with a number of additional moves planned

before the year-end.

18.

Correspondence

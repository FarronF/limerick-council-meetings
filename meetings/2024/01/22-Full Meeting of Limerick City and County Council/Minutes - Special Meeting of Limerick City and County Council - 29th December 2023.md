The Mayor thanked everybody for attending the Special Meeting, explaining that it was being

held so as to pass a Vote of Sympathy following the sad passing of Patrick (Paddy) Madden,

former Mayor of Limerick.

Deep sympathy was expressed to his wife Mary, children Pat & Claire, and to the extended

family, friends and community, on their loss.

Members thanked the Mayor for calling the Special Meeting. They noted that Paddy Madden

was a member of the Fianna Fáil party, that he was first elected to Limerick Corporation in

1979, and he had held his seat in the Council until 1991.

He had served as Mayor of Limerick for two terms. He first served as Mayor in 1988-89, before

wearing the robes once more in 1990-91 as Limerick celebrated Treaty 300, the 300th year

since the signing of the Treaty. They also recalled that he was the last Mayor to serve a full

term in the old Town Hall at Rutland Street.

They recalled his work with not only Treaty 300, but also his involvement on Limerick City

VEC, the Harbour Commissioners and the Mid-Western Health Board, which highlighted his

diverse range of interests, all with the common theme of making Limerick City a better place.---

about his community, and proud of his roots, being from the Canal Bank in Rhebogue,

Limerick. He was educated at St Patrick’s National School and St Munchin’s College, and

played sports with Richmond RFC, Caledonians FC and St Patrick’s GAA Club.

The Chief Executive, on behalf of Management and staff, expressed his condolences to his

wife Mary, children Pat & Clair and to their extended family and friends, on their loss.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Mayor held a minute's silence as a mark of respect.

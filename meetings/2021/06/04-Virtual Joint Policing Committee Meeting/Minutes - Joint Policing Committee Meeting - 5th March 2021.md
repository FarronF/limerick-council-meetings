17.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Liam Galvin**

*“I will move at the next Meeting that a joint operation between the Council and the Gardaí take*

*place to tackle the scourge of illegal dumping in our county (particularly Rooska)”.*

Councillor Galvin outlined the extent of the illegal dumping at Rooska and asked that the installation

of CCTV be considered at this location in Rooska.

In reply, the Chief Superintendent referred to the Litter Pollution Act 1997 and the Waste

Management Act 1996 as amended. In March 2020 there was a finding that the Litter Pollution Act

1997, the Waste Management Act 1996 and the Local Government Act 2001 do not provide a lawful

basis for use of CCTV to detect littler offences. The Data Protection Commission comprehensively

considered these Acts and found that they do not regulate the processing of personal data as is

required by the Law Enforcement Directive, as transposed by the Data Protection Act 2018. He

stated that the issue around admissibility of CCTV could be detrimental to prosecution and result in

significant fines to the Council for breaches.

**18.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Liam Galvin**

*“I will move at the next Meeting that this meeting call on the Minister for Justice to enact legislat**ion*

*or amend current legislation, as necessary, to put the onus on parents of children under 16 who are*

*gathering / loitering in public areas and engaging in anti social behaviour, to be responsible for their*

*children. I would recommend that sanctions be imposed on parents whose children are engaging in*

*such behaviour by means of fines and that these fines would be recovered by way of attachment of*

*earnings, if applicable”.*

The Motion was proposed by Councillor L. Galvin, seconded by Councillor S. Keary and agreed.

The Chief Superintendent stated that he fully recognizes the challenges with young people gathering

in groups but, similar to covid enforceability, the policing of young persons has different processes

and policies which are centred upon protectionism and enhanced rights.

He stated that children suspected of a breach of the criminal law is governed by the Children Act,

2001 which was amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 and

other Acts. The age of criminal responsibility – Section 52 of the Children Act 2001 as amended by

Section 129 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. In October 2006 the age of criminal responsibility rose

from seven years of age to twelve years of age. This means that children who have not reached the

age of 12 years cannot be charged or arrested for ordinary offences with certain exceptions

(Offences suitable for Central Criminal Court). Section 130 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 places an

onus on the Gardaí to take a child under 12 years of age to his/her parents or guardian, where they

have reasonable grounds for believing that the child has committed a criminal offence. However, no

formal Garda action is permitted without parents or guardian present.

Where a child under 14 years of age is arrested for an offence, no further proceedings can be taken

without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Where there are concerns for the safety

and welfare of a child the Gardaí have mandated responsibilities to make formal referrals to TUSLA

and relevant state Agency.

Options where criminal offence occurred Children aged 12-17



Garda Youth Diversion Programme (on foot of formal complainant or Garda intercept

offence



Anti Social Behaviour Warnings (consistent behaviour)



Contact with parents – appropriate action in low % of cases

**Overview on Crime Statistics from Senior Crime and Policing Analyst**

Ms. L. Collins gave a brief statistical overview of current crime statistics.

**4.**

**Presentation from Inspector Brendan O’Grady on the control of horses**

Inspector O’Grady stated that the Council is the lead agency in the control of horses and the Gárdaí

and Veterinary Officials are there to assist. He stated all horses in Ireland must be properly

identified and have a passport, be licenced if in a ‘Control Area’ and be microchipped.

He stated that an authorised person or a member of the Garda Síochána may seize and detain any

horse that the person or member has reason to suspect is :



A stray horse



Causing a nuisance



Not under adequate control



Posing a danger to persons or property



Posing a threat to the health and welfare of persons or other animals



Being kept in a control area without a horse licence



Not identifiable or capable of identification as may be required by Section 28



In or being kept or ridden or driven in an area contrary to any bye laws made

under Section 47

In 2019 109 horses were seized at a cost of 72,859 and 128 horses were seized in 2020 at a cost of

€144,588. For the months of January and February this year a total of 22 horses have been seized.

Only one horse was put down in 2020, all other horses were rehomed.

In reply to Members queries, Inspector O’Grady stated that the present legislation in relation to the

control of horses is adequate, however, pointed out that funding is the issue. He stated that it is the

Council’s decision who to award the contract for the seizure of horses to, however, the present

contractor is very efficient. He added that landowners have a duty to fence their land if keeping

horses and if an accident occurs it is the responsibility of the landowner. In reply to Members

concerns about horses in the racecourse he confirmed that he would speak to the owners of these

horses and outline their responsibilities.

Members acknowledged that there is a horse problem in the suburbs of the city, however, pointed

out that there is also an issue in Askeaton and asked the Gardaí to address the issue here also.

Members expressed concern that horses are being put in to unsecured land where the title of the

property can be difficult to determine and are then claiming ownership of these patches of land. A

Working Group need to be set up with Council Officials and the Department of Agriculture Officials

to address this problem and suggested that an Animal Welfare Officer be appointed. Members

welcomed the success of the morning seizures and acknowledged the work carried out by Inspector

O’Grady and the Gárdaí. They referred to the success of the Youth Academy in Moyross and said

they would welcome the rollout of a similar project in the southside of the city. Members

acknowledged that owners of land also need to be protected and added that anybody keeping

animals should have the land or property to keep them in.

The Members congratulated the Council and the Gardaí for the work they are doing in addressing

the horse issue in the city.

dropped significantly. He said there is only a small number of people causing problems in Johnsgate

Village and pointed out that some of the houses there are privately rented . He stated that CCTV

would help in addressing crime in these areas and said the Gardaí will continue to monitor the

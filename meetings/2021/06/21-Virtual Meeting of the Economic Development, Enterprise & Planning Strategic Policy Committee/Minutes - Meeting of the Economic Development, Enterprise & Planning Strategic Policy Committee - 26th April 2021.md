**Item 2**

**Revised Standing Orders**

P. Fitzgerald informed members that the revised Standing Orders for the conduct of SPC Meetings

were approved by the full Council at its March meeting. The Standing Orders were revised and

updated to ensure that there was consistency across all SPC’s to address procedural issues that

will improve the management of SPC meetings. The main changes to the Standing Orders were:

 Arrangements for Meetings – 5 Ordinary Meetings per annum

 Meetings to be held at least 2 weeks in advance of full Council

 10 days’ notice to members for Ordinary Meetings

 3 days’ notice to members for Special Meetings

 Quorum – ¼ of membership + 1

 Submission of Items for Agenda – each member may submit 1 item for agenda (at least 12

days in advance of date of the meeting)

 Make provision for holding of Remote / Virtual Meetings.

While members thanked P. Fitzgerald for the presentation, they expressed concern that it was

very difficult to get work carried out as Council Meetings were held bi-monthly and notice of

motions referred from SPC meetings could take up to 6 weeks to be considered at Full Council

meeting and they also requested more prompt action from outcomes from Council meetings.
---
M Lyes welcomed the 10 days’ notice for ordinary meetings, which allows sectoral representatives

the opportunity to consult with their relevant sectors. She stated that it was fundamental to the

working of the PPN in relation to SPC’s.

**Item 3**

**URDF Funding Briefing**

V. Murray gave a presentation on the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), which

aims to support more compact and sustainable development, as set out in Project Ireland 2040,

through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland’s five cities and other large towns, in line

with the objectives of the National Planning Framework (NPF) and National Development Plan

(NDP). It will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be

delivered within the existing built-up footprints of cities and towns and ensure that urban areas

can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to

invest and to visit. It is one of four funds set up under the National Development Plan 2018-2027

and has an allocation of €2 billion under the NDP up to 2027.

The following table outlines the 4 applications made by Limerick City and County Council and

funding granted:

Members thanked Vincent for the presentation and stated that €116m was a serious investment

to Limerick City on top of projects currently underway i.e. O’Connell Street Revitalisation and the

proposed Opera Centre. Members particularly complemented the staff who prepared the detailed

applications, which resulted in full funding received in a number of the projects.

Detailed discussion took place on the various projects and members queried the timeline for

spending the money granted and queried if any assessment had been carried out on the proposed

number of job creations as a result of the proposed developments.

V. Murray confirmed that the monies had to be expended by end of 2026 and that a number of

the projects outlined, required planning permission before construction works could commence.

He also confirmed that under the NPF that it is proposed that the population of Limerick will

increase by 50,000 over next 20 years and that 12,000 jobs will need to be created in Limerick to

accommodate this proposed increase of population.

He also informed members that master planning was nearing completion on the Cleeves Site and

that it was proposed that it would be for a mixed use development and that once plans were in

place, further information would be made available to members.

Replying to members, he also confirmed that the Community Department were currently awaiting

the outcome of funding for a number of projects in towns and villages in Limerick under the Rural

Development Fund. It was agreed that a presentation on the Rural Development Fund

applications/allocations would be given to members at an upcoming meeting.

**Item 4**

**Georgian District Update**

R. Webb gave a presentation on Limerick’s Living Georgian City Programme, which is a historic city

centre revitalisation process that is being piloted in Limerick’s Georgian Neighbourhood. The

objectives of the progamme are:

 Encourage and increase residential occupancy, reduce dereliction and vacancy

 Diversify the community particularly in terms of provision of affordable homes suitable for

a diverse community

 Upgrade the historic building stock to best conservation and energy efficiency standards

The programme is supported by funding from URDF and Horizon 2020.

Key activities to date include the Housing Demonstration Projects at 58, O’Connell Street and

33/34, Thomas Street (design proposals being finalised) and the Laneways Demonstration Project.

L. McMahon followed up with a detailed presentation on the Laneways Project.

She stated that a Design Team, led by Tobin Consulting Engineers were appointed to prepare a

strategy document for the development of 25 Laneways in the city centre. Public engagement

was held and workshops took place with elected members, council staff and staff/students from

St. Michael’s School. It is hoped the strategy will be finalised by Summer 2021.

The objective of the project is to improve pedestrianisation in the city centre, to provide

community centred social spaces for both business and residents, provide opportunities for play,

sport and art events and improve access for the servicing of laneways. There is a broad diversity in

the laneways included and they have been categorised into 3 categories: living lanes, activity

lanes and community lanes, depending on location, footfall and surrounding businesses.

Members welcomed the laneways project and were delighted that Augustinian Lane was included

as there was an ongoing issue regarding waste bins in the laneway.

They also queried if there was any collaboration between the laneways project and the outdoor

dining scheme for Summer 2021 and was informed that it was hoped that proposals for events /

outdoor dining in the laneways would be submitted by business owners for the Summer period.

Following discussion regarding planning requirements for canopies and awnings attached to

structures, P. Fitzgerald pointed out that they were awaiting confirmation from the Minister’s

Office of the intention to waive planning fees for canopies and awnings for this year.

He stated that he would liaise with Planning Department staff re adopting a more flexible

approach regarding licence requirements and address the issue of time lags regarding applications

for licences.

Members expressed concern that there was an unwillingness to get involved due to future

increased fees and P. Fitzgerald confirmed that future fees would be discussed at budget

preparation time, which will be adopted by the Council.

On the proposal of Cllr. J. Collins, seconded by Cllr. B. Collins, it was unanimously agreed to

consider the matter at a future SPC meeting and to make a recommendation on proposed licence

fees to Head of Finance, prior to preparation of Budget 2022.

P. Fitzgerald informed members that seating at the rear of premises did not require S254 Licence

and that a separate application was not required for a footpath buildout.

While members welcomed the Outdoor Public Space Scheme, which will be a great support for

many artists, they suggested liaising with representatives from King John’s Castle, Dolan’s and the

Milk Market, when considering plans for this scheme.

Members expressed concern on the issue of overcrowding on the footpaths at the three bridges

walk and was informed by V. Murray that the Physical Directorate would be implementing a

number of initiatives in the area for the Summer period and he would discuss proposals with B.

Kennedy, Director of Service and report back to members.

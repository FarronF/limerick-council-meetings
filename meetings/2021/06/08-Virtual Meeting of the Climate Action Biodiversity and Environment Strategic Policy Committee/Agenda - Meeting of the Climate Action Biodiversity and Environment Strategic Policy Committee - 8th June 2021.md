(Anne

Goggin,

LCCC). Ms. Goggin noted the council would look at their contract for weed control

and at pre-emergent spraying options. The Climate Action, Biodiversity and

Environment Linkage group members are concerned about the continued use of

herbicide spray in and around housing estates, public areas and parks. I request an

update from LCCC and their contractors on how much herbicide is being applied

annually and ask has there been a reduction in use and quantity of application over

the past 5 years across the county and city? “

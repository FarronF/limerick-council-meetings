**2.Strategic Housing Development (SHD) Application to An Bord Pleanála at Walkers Lane,**

**Annacotty**

The A/Senior Executive Officer, Planning and Environmental Services gave a presentation to the

Members on the proposed Strategic Housing Development Application and briefed the Members

on the content of the proposed application.

The Members noted that the proposed development was similar to the application, which was

brought to the Members during 2020 and queried whether the concerns raised previously had

been taken into account by An Bord Pleanála.

Following a detailed discussion of the application, the members highlighted the following items in

relation to the current application:

• The proposed density is higher than set out in the Castletroy Local Area Plan and is higher

relative to other nearby developments including the Rivers Estate. They suggested that

the development should be reduced to 35 units per hectare;
---

• There is a general lack of adequate car parking provision for the scheme which will result

in parking issues on the road and in the general vicinity;

• With existing traffic congestion issues, this proposed development will result in additional

traffic volumes of cars, adding to congestion;

• Concerns regarding excessive height of 3 to 5 stories, having regard to the fact that

predominately there are mainly two storey dwellings adjacent to site;

• Did An Bord Pleanála consider the concerns raised previously by Elected Members in

relation to the previous application;

• There was a lack of one bedroom apartments in the development, and this development

would be suitable for a higher proportion;

• The development is out of character with the area, with a negative visual impact from the

road;

• Social housing is grouped in two locations, contrary to policy;

• Concerns in relation to the single entrance and poor sightline visibility for drivers.

• An Bord Pleanála should revisit the whole project in a wider sense and consider the local

community;

• The need for housing is recognised but concerns remain in relation to density and height;

• Adequate secure bike storage is needed;

• Adequate charging facilities for electric cars and electric bikes are required;

• Has an adequate assessment of the impact of the development on the river taken place?

**3.Annual Meeting**

(NTA) on completion. The NTA will complete an initial design study to determine the most

appropriate option/s, including proposed bus lanes on this street or an alternative option

with cycle lanes and bus priority provision at junctions. Limerick City and County Council

will co-ordinate with the NTA and advance the scheme once the optimum approach is

agreed.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and***

***County Council advise was Boherkyle included in the noise pollution survey given to the TII and***

***if not can a survey be done on this area.***

**REPLY**: In Limerick’s Noise Action Plan 2018 to 2023, a total of 14 noise “hotspots” were

identified. These are areas of relatively high population density where significant numbers

of people may be exposed to excessive noise levels from traffic. Noise monitoring and

modelling has been carried out in respect of two of these hotspots to date. These

are Monaleen and Ballycummin. Cost benefit analyses in respect of potential mitigation

measures for these areas were prepared and submitted to TII for review. Similar

exercises will be carried out in relation to the other hotspots over the life of the Noise

Action Plan.

Boherkyle was not identified as a noise hotspot in the Noise Action Plan and it is unlikely

to be identified as one in the future due to the low population density in this area and the

small number of properties affected.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and***

***County Council provide an update on what road safety measures are proposed for the Bloodmill***

***Road and Old Singland Road. With the new development on the Bloodmill Road traffic will***

***increase significantly in the area.***

**REPLY**: There are currently no road safety measures proposed for the Bloodmill Road or Old

SIngland Road. Should an issue arise in the area it will be assessed under the Traffic

Management Policy of Limerick City and County Council.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when the Part 8 for the***

***boundary wall for Mount St. Oliver Cemetery will be advertised and why there has been a delay***

***in advertising it. Previously, the Council committed to carry out the works on the boundary wall***

***at this location in Q1/Q2 of 2021. We are in Q2 now and the Part 8 is still to be advertised.***

**REPLY**: Design & Delivery Services have recently commenced work on this project. This project

was discussed at a recent Area Briefing with agreement to consult locally on the detail of

the design of the boundary wall, e.g. height, railing type, etc. prior to submitting the Part 8

application. It is envisaged that this consultation will take place in May with the  Part8

submitted in June.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask the Director of Services, Physical Development, for an update on actions taken to date***

***in response to my Notice of Motion from the July 2020 Meeting of the Climate Action,***
---

***Biodiversity and Environment SPC dealing with pilot sensors for the litterbin service as well as***

***looking at the possible use of solar compacting bins.***

**REPLY**: The Council had intended to install sensors in a number of the street litterbins to monitor

capacity but Covid 19 affected the supply of these sensors to the Council. Over the last

number of months, the Council has witnessed a dramatic increase in waste in a number of

areas, resulting in the provision of additional wheelie bins in the city in a number of

locations and also providing an additional litterbin collection service. The Council also

relocated four solar compacting bins into the city centre, adjacent to food outlet areas.

These solar bins provide information on when the bins are reaching certain levels of

capacity. The Council are now utilising these bins as a pilot to determine level of service

required in these areas.

The Department of Communications, Climate Action & Environment has recently

announced €5million in funding for litter prevention and cleaning. The Council intends to

apply for this funding to purchase solar bins for the city. The information provided by solar

compacting bins will allow the Council to monitor the litterbin service and ensure an

efficient service with bins concentrated in areas of greatest need. The Council has

investigated a litterbin tagging system and currently do not have the funding available for

the system. The Council are considering the litterbin tagging system as part of the funding

application to the Department of Communications, Climate Action & Environment.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for details of traffic***

***calming measures and interventions in housing estates that have been designated a “30kph***

***Slow Zone”.***

**REPLY**: 30kph Slow Zones are identified with signage at the boundaries of the zones. If further

measures are requested, these are assessed on a case-by-case nature in accordance with

the Limerick City and County Council Traffic Management Policy.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what measures Limerick***

***City and County Council are implementing to facilitate hospitality reopening and trading under***

***COVID restrictions during the “Outdoor Summer”? What canopies, awn**ings or other coverings***

***will be erected by Limerick City and County Council, at what locations will they be placed and***

***when will they be complete?***

***What footpath buildouts will be completed, at what locations will they be placed and when will***

***they be complete? What streets or laneways will be pedestrianised / partially pedestrianised or***

***made available for outdoor hospitality and when will this happen?***

**REPLY**: Failte Ireland has invited local authorities to apply for funding for the installation of

facilities that will enable weatherproofed outdoor dining to assist in the re-opening of

the economy. The Council is currently completing an application to Failte Ireland to

install covered pergolas in Bedford Row and Lower Thomas Street that will enable

businesses in these streets to provide al fresco dining. The infrastructure, once provided,
---

must last for 5 years to qualify for funding. Additionally, the proposal must be for

pedestrianised/partly pedestrianised streets. If approved by Failte Ireland, the proposal

will require Part VIII approval by Elected Members and will be subject to detailed design.

Delivery is dependent on the above steps being completed.

Members are aware that the Metropolitan area has been assigned approx. 10 build outs

from funding available from the National Transport Authority for 2021. A number of

applications/expressions of interest have already been received, of which some have been

provisionally approved and some continue to be assessed at present. Applicants will be

notified as soon as their applications have been approved in principle. The delivery of the

build outs will commence as early as possible.

The Council has received applications from businesses with proposals to temporarily and

partially close 8 streets/laneways in the core business district. All requests received have

been examined and will be advertised in the local press as a first step. The proposal is to

close the streets each day with effect from Thursday 10th June through to Monday 1st

November and for differing times, depending on the location. It is necessary under the

Roads Act that these proposals be advertised for submissions to be made by persons that

may be affected by same.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, given the fantastic public***

***response and success of recent street murals, what is the process of choosing who is depicted,***

***how are locations chosen and if the process can be opened for the public to engage and make***

***further submissions or suggestions for consideration.***

**REPLY**: Limerick has a rich variety of Street Art, the majority of which has been produced

independently, by a number of organisations. This is subject to approval by the relevant

Limerick City and County Council Departments and Committees. Usually Limerick

City and

County Council have no input into themes and selection of location.

The majority of the street art in Limerick has been coordinated by **Draw Out: Urban**

**Exhibitionist -** an Urban Regeneration Initiative that uses the most contemporary

examples of Urban Art to reimagine space. Over the ten years they have been operating in

Limerick, Draw Out have funded their work through competitive open calls and through

securing private funding.

The honouring of Dodo Reddan through a street art installation was submitted to Protocol

Committee. Given the exceptional nature of the COVID19 pandemic, Limerick City and

County Council were delighted to partner with Draw Out to make this project possible.

While Limerick City and County Council have no regular programme for the production of

murals, in 2021 a stream of funding became available, which due to the nature of the

project was theme and location specific. This project is in progress and has been

administered through open call; The Military, Maritime, Industrial Atlantic Heritage

(MMIAH) project. The location and theme for this project is site specific.

Limerick City and County Council are preparing a Public Art Policy and Strategy, which will

reference types of Public Art, and examine this issue further.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the results of the***

***recent traffic survey on Rosbrien Road to be made available.***

**REPLY**: A copy of the Traffic Study conducted at the Rosbrien Road was circulated as part of the

reply.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an updated list of the***

***membership of the newly recommenced Limerick Forum.***

**REPLY**: The Chief Executive decided to re-convene the Limerick Forum to assist in the review of

the Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Strategy which is now seven years old and

requires revision.

Similar to the previous Limerick Economic Forum established in 2013, the new forum will

be chaired by Denis Brosnan with members acting in a voluntary capacity to advise

the Chief Executive on the review.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update of the tree***

***felling on the site of Gough Place, Rossbrien Road.***

**REPLY**: As part of the design development for the 17 new housing units at Gough Place a tree

survey and arborist report was prepared in October 2018, by Michael Garry of Arbor Care,

a professional member of the Arboricultural Association. Eleven trees along the boundary

line between Gough Place and Punch’s Close were examined. Two of these trees were

suitable for retention and 9 have been removed for the reasons detailed below.

•

Of the 9 trees that were removed 6 were “large over-mature Monterey cypress

trees”, 2 were early-mature small leaf limes and 1 was an early-mature sycamore.

•

The trees along this boundary were identified as having “outgrown their living

space and are no longer appropriate for their location.”

•

The condition of the trees are described as follows: “Many of the cypress have

suffered significant storm damage and stem loss, they have also been over pruned on the

apartment side (Punch’s Close), which has resulted in un-balancing the canopies. There

are two trees worthy of retention in the row namely T10 and T11 these trees are in good

condition and can be retained. It is recommended from an arboricultural view that the

remaining trees are removed.”

•

The report adds: “These trees are currently a hazard for the apartment’s and will

be

within

falling

distance

of

the

new

development,

it

is

prudent arboricultural management to remove these trees and to plant site appropriate

trees that would maintain screening and enhance the amenity and biodiversity of the

site.”

•

The report recommended that the trees were removed prior to construction and

occupation of the new housing.

•

The tree report and survey was included in the Part 8 application to the local

authority (Planning ref: 18/8014) and granted planning on December 11th 2018.

•

The design team have engaged with the National Parks and Wildlife Services, who

are satisfied with the approach.

•

A comprehensive landscaping plan is proposed as part of the current works, which

includes for replanting this boundary with semi-mature native species, with 2 new trees

proposed for each tree removed (18 no. new trees in total along this boundary).

**19.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***Clonmacken Part 8 housing development and if the Council could issue an explanation for the***

***delay.***

**REPLY**: The Clonmacken development, comprising the construction of 43 no. social housing units,

is advancing. The project is currently behind programme. Limerick City and County Council

are liaising with the contractor and Design Team on programme related issues, which are

being dealt with in accordance with the contract.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the Council to install***

***additional temporary bins around the "Three Bridges Walk" in the Metropolitan area for the***

***Summer period.***

**REPLY**: The Council has provided additional wheelie bins in the busiest areas of the City to cater

for the increased level of waste. This includes the “Three Bridges Walk". The Council also

services the litterbins twice daily. The Council are monitoring the litterbin service to

determine the most effective times to service the bins, as this may likely be the solution in

the interim.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for Limerick Council to put***

***in place temporary traffic counters on the Father Russell Road to count bikes, cars, trucks and***

***pedestrians and furnish the Members with the data at the next meeting.***

**REPLY**: The Council are currently in the process of procuring traffic counters to monitor road

movements (traffic, cycle and pedestrian) on the Strategic Transport Routes identified in

LSMATS. Father Russell Road will be included in the roads to be surveyed. Once the

procurement and installation of the counters is completed, counts will be available to

view.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors S. Kiely and D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with hospitality traders, other local traders and An Garda Siochána to***

***put plans in place to create a designated outdoor dining area in Limerick City Centre.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor McSweeney, seconded by Councillor Kiely and agreed.

Members welcomed the initiatives for outdoor dining facilities and highlighted the need to have

proposals in place as quickly as possible.

**REPLY**: Officials of Limerick City & County Council have been liaising closely with all

stakeholders in the City Centre in preparation for the re-opening of businesses in the

The Council has put in place a series of initiatives that will assist and support the

hospitality sector to provide outdoor dining facilities. These include:

• Operation of the Outdoor Furniture Grant Scheme

• Winter proofing and Outdoor Dining Infrastructure Scheme

• Tables & Chairs License’s and Footpath Buildouts

• Street Event Licensing and Temporary Road Closures

The Winter proofing Scheme (above) is specific to the Bedford Row / Lr Thomas Street

area of the City Centre where there is a concentration of hospitality type businesses. The
---
12

traders in this area have been consulted regarding the proposals. An application for

funding for this initiative is to be lodged with Fáilte Ireland in the coming weeks. This

scheme allied to the Outdoor Furniture Scheme has the potential to create a focal point

for outdoor dining in the City Centre. It will be complimented by the other initiatives

outlined above.

The Council has engaged, not only with the traders in this area but also with hospitality /

retail interests in the wider city centre area. A City Centre Liaison group has been

established by the Limerick Chamber of Commerce and the Independent Traders Group to

work with the Council to help create a more vibrant city centre experience for the citizens

of Limerick and visitors alike. The liaison group is representative of the hotels, restaurants,

vintners and retail businesses operating in the City Centre. Currently this group is meeting

on a weekly basis.

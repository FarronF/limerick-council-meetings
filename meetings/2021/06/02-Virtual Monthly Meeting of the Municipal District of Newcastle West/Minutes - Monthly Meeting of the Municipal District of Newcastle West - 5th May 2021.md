Councillor Galvin expressed dissatisfaction at the response received with regard to the
number of dog fouling and litter fines issued in 2021. Concern was expressed with regard to
the rise in incidents of illegal dumping and dog fouling in recent months. Where fines were
issued, the type of offence and percentage paid was also raised. The roaming of dangerous
breeds of dogs on the green areas in housing estates was also an area of concern. Following
discussion by the Members, it was agreed that a representative from the Planning and
Environmental Services would be invited to attend the June Meeting to discuss these matters.

5. Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

| will ask at the next Meeting that this Council does all it can to put resources into reducing
waiting time for housing grants applications and to fast track the assessment and approval
of grants in emergency situations such as leaking roofs. Essential repairs have to be made
priority.

REPLY: As applications for Private housing grants are received, it is considered
appropriate for the emergency nature of the works to be highlighted e.g.
where it is deemed that the house cannot be lived in or is causing severe
concern. We will endeavour to process the application as a priority.

Irrespective of the circumstances, all documentation must be included with
the application in order to satisfy Department of Housing audit requirements.
Currently Level 5 restrictions mean that inspections have reduced. However,
with external inspections, works are progressing on private homes classed as
emergency.

As applications are received they are checked and registered on the system.
An acknowledgement letter is sent to each applicant.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that priority be given to upgrading
Newcastle West Waste Water Treatment Plant. An update on the requested meeting with
Irish Water was also raised and the Meetings Administrator agreed to follow up on this

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

| will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council explore a walk that is
colloquially known as the Four Crosses walk in Glin to become a Sli na Slainte walk especially
the part that’s on the N69.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY: As the area noted above is on a National Primary route a submission on the
above proposal will be made to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for their
consideration.

However, it is our opinion that creating a walking route and encouraging
pedestrians to walk along the busy N69 route would represent a safety concern
as it would necessitate the pedestrians crossing the N69 at a location with poor
sightlines.

in relatively good condition.

However, further improvement works on this roadway could be considered
under a Community Involvement Scheme for 2022.

in proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan requested that the entire area leading towards

Filtertek be enhanced. A discussion followed and in replying, the Senior Executive Engineer

stated that improvement works will be considered at this location and that a meeting would
take place on site with the relevant stakeholders.

| will move at the next Meeting that (a) public lighting and litter bins be provided along
the Limerick Greenway on both short sections immediately on either side of Station Road
(b) that a native tree planting programme be put in place to compliment the amenity
where this is possible.

lighting in the future. On completion of the current work programme this
proposal will be considered subject to funding.

The Council will examine a suitable location for a bin at Station Road where
both sections referred to meet the public road. Along other sections of the
greenway, it will be necessary that users take their litter home having regard

Council will examine opportunities to enhance biodiversity on the Greenway
and will consider a native tree planting programme where possible.

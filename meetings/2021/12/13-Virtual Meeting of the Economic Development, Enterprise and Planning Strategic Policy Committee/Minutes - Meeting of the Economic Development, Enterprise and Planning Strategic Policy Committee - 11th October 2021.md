Cllr. Hartigan stated that swifts are a migrating bird from Africa and its numbers have declined

by 80% in recent years due to the lack of suitable nesting sites in certain buildings.

Tom O’Neill, Heritage Officer, stated that he plans to hold a Swift survey with Bird Watch

Ireland in the next year to inform the Planning Department of the requirements to encourage

nesting sites.

On the Proposal of Cllr. Hartigan, seconded by Cllr. Novak Uí Chonchúir, it was unanimously

agreed to make the inclusion of swift bird nesting boxes on suitable sites, a planning condition

as part of the planning application process.---

Following lengthy discussion on this Notice of Motion, it was agreed to defer the Notice of Motion to

a future meeting and have wording of Motion amended to apply to housing developments only, as

outlined in minutes of meeting of 21st June, 2021.

**Item 4**

**Presentation on Draft Planning Development Contribution Scheme**

Noreen O’Connell, Executive Planner, gave a comprehensive presentation on the Draft Development

Contribution Scheme. The making of a contribution scheme is a reserved function and S48 of the

Planning & Development Act empowers Local Authorities to require payment of a development

contribution as a condition of planning permission.

The new scheme from 2022-2026, with funding requests of approx. €99m, include Public Realm

works countywide, provision and maintenance of burial grounds, upgrade of playgrounds and

maintenance of community centres, provision of greenways, walkways and flood protection

infrastructure.

The following timeline was outlined for the review of the development contribution scheme:



Two workshops held with elected members on 28th September and 7th October at which a

number of issues were discussed and recommendations had been made.



Draft Scheme to go on display 16th October, 2021 for 6 weeks



Chief Executive’s Report to issue to Elected Members on 13th December, 2021



Briefing meeting with Elected Members early January 2022 on submissions to the Draft Scheme



Scheme to be made at Council Meeting in January 2022

Members thanked Noreen for the comprehensive presentation and welcomed the list of

projects being funded under the development contribution scheme.

A lengthy debate ensued and members expressed concern at the proposed increase of 25%

in development levies, which could impact on first time buyers as developers pass on the

charges, particularly in the current economic climate and the lack of available housing. They

also expressed concern over the introduction of levies in Regeneration areas, where no

levies existed under the current scheme, and the comparison of levies between commercial

developments in rural and urban areas and the lack of services available for development in

rural areas.

Cllr Galvin proposed that the Mayor should call a special meeting of the full Council to make

the decision on the issue of the placing of the scheme on public display. This proposal did

not receive any support. The decision to place the draft scheme on public display is an

executive function.

A proposal to support the Executive to place the Scheme (as presented) on public display

was agreed by the SPC, with one member opposing it. Members were informed that

following public display, the Chief Executive would prepare a report on the submissions

received, for the members to consider. M. Woods confirmed that another workshop for---
elected members would be convened in advance of Council Meeting in January. The

members will make or amend the proposed scheme at the January 2022 Council Meeting.

**Item 5**

**Job Creation and Business Supports in Limerick**



**Industrial Development Authority (IDA)**

Will Corcoran, Regional Manager, MW, IDA and Ray O’Connor, Regional Manager SW, gave a

presentation on IDA’s Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth Strategy 2021-2024, which was

launched at a time of unprecedented uncertainty and accelerating change. Global Foreign Direct

Investment has declined sharply and is expected to remain challenged through 2021. The IDA’s

ambition is to capitalise on opportunities to provide Multi-National Companies with solutions to

challenges they face in this difficult global environment.

Over the period 2021-2024, the IDA hope to win 400 regional investments, (76 in the Mid-West) to

support job creation and economic activity. The IDA are focused on securing investments from new

and existing clients in the following sectors: Technology, Consumer & Business Services,

International Financial Services, Biopharmaceuticals & Food, Medical Technologies and Engineering.

In the mid-west, the IDA support 143 Companies, with direct/indirect employment totalling 43,504.

Companies in Limerick include: Analog Devices, Dell Technology, WP Engine, General Motors, Uber,

Northern Trust, ACI, Transact Campus, Regeneron, Johnson & Johnson, Cook Medical and Stryker,

along with 40 indigenous companies benefitting indirectly.

Mr. Corcoran referred to the Advanced Manufacturing Facility (AMF) at the National Technology

Park, which is nearing completion. It will house smart manufacturing technologies and be an

opportunity for existing clients to embrace new technologies and will act as a catalyst for economic

growth.

The delivery of the Strategy will require extensive collaboration with local / national stakeholders

including the provision of proper development infrastructure, housing, schools, healthcare and place

making ensuring Limerick is a good place to live/work and attract employees to the region.



**Enterprise Ireland (EI)**

Jerry Moloney Regional Director MW, Enterprise Ireland, supported by Catherine Hogan, Sen.

Regional Development Executive, gave a presentation on business supports provided by Enterprise

Ireland. EI are responsible for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets and

work with entrepreneurs, established business owners and Irish multinational companies. The range

of services provided is extensive, from funding to making introductions in key international markets.

Mr. Moloney referred to the following EI supported projects/initiatives in Limerick:

 Digital Collaboration Centre in Engine – to be completed by Q3 2022

 LEDP Centre – in excess of €1m invested for SME’s – (currently over 1,000 jobs)

 Regional Technology Cluster Fund

 BNest Social Initiative – UL

 Community Enterprise Centres funded by EI

 Research and Innovation at 3rd level and business---
EI has 593 clients in Limerick, with 9,774 people employed and provide a wide range of services to

these companies.

While members welcomed the presentations from both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, they

expressed concern over staff shortages, particularly in the hospitality area and the low take-up of

apprenticeships. They also highlighted the lack of services available to companies wishing to locate

in rural towns.

Mr. Corcoran pointed out that the shortage of staff was a global issue, particularly in the technology

and manufacturing sectors and that the IDA were working closely with the Academic Institutes and

Regional Skills Forum to provide a suite of programmes for companies.

Mr. Moloney informed members that a lot of work was being done at transition year level to

persuade students and parents to pursue the apprenticeship route rather than academic and that

plans were being put in place to build a new campus for that purpose.

Replying to members, Mr. Moloney stated that plans did not materialise for projects at the landbank

in Askeaton over the last 2-3 years and that they will continue to promote private and publically

owned lands to companies who wish to locate in the region.

**Item 6**

**Adoption of Limerick City and County Council’s Draft Diaspora Strategy –**

**GLOBAL LIMERICK 2021–2025**

Tim O’Connor, Chairperson of the Global Limerick Advisory Group gave a verbal presentation on

Limerick City and County Council’s Draft Diaspora Strategy – GLOBAL LIMERICK 2021-2025.

The strategy, which is the culmination of a number of years work is very much based on a mutual

relationship between Limerick and its Diaspora and holds huge potential.

Once the strategy is adopted, an action plan will be prepared to implement the objectives of the

strategy and will focus on a number of key locations both internationally and locally. They will work

closely with Central Government Agencies and Government of Ireland Embassies and Consulates

around the world, to ensure maximum synergy with their activities.

He referred to the Year of the Invitation 2023 and The Ryder Cup 2027, which will be tremendous

opportunities to engage with the Diaspora.

Members endorsed the draft strategy, stating that it was an excellent initiative, which will highlight

the goodwill that exists for Limerick and promote tourism and economic activity in Limerick. They

also complemented staff in the Economic Development and Enterprise Directorate who had worked

on the preparation of the draft strategy.

**Item 7**

**Update on Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028**

Item to be deferred to next meeting.

**Item 8**

**Discussion on S254 Licences Fees (Tables & Chairs) for 2022**

Members welcomed the large amount of outdoor dining facilities available in Limerick during the

pandemic, which had been funded under the Outdoor Seating & Accessories for Tourism and---
Hospitality Business Scheme, run by Failte Ireland and the Local Authorities. They also expressed

concern that the licence fees for outdoor furniture on public areas, which had been waived for

2021, were very prohibitive going forward. Concern was also expressed over the lack of regulation

regarding the placement of furniture on public footpaths and obstructions caused to the elderly

and vulnerable users.

Pat Fitzgerald, SEO, stated that the fees are set at a national level and that the Planning

Development Section were in discussion with the Department regarding fees for 2022 and will

notify members of any update on same.

Nuala O’Connell, Senior Planner stated that all comments regarding regulations will be taken into

consideration and a guidance leaflet would be prepared and circulated to all businesses involved in

the Scheme.

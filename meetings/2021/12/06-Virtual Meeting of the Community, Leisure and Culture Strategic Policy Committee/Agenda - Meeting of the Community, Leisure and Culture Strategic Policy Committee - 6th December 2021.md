**Item 3**

**To consider a notice of motion from Cllr Elena Secas (Referred from the**

**Metropolitan District of Limerick meeting held on 18th** **October, 2021)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that

Limerick City and County Council calls on the Community, Leisure and Culture

SPC to timetable at its next meeting for a strategic discussion the following

issue:

- the sense of community and place of the residential community in estates

near UL is being fundamentally damaged by the Council’s failure to protect

these ‘10 minute walk neighbourhoods’ from the devastating effects of

the ever expanding UL student intake. This along with the high dependence of

UL management on privately managed, houses of multiple occupancy (HMOs)

to accommodate the majority of their students, with many HMOs being

inappropriately managed. These issues, coupled with the student

accommodation crisis and the antisocial behaviour of some UL students, are

damaging the residential community resulting thus in a trend of many

residents being forced out of their homes over the years.

**Item 1: Adopt minutes of the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy**

**Committee Meeting that was held on 8****th** **June, 2021.**

The minutes were proposed by Cllr. O’Brien, seconded by Cllr. Hartigan, and adopted.

**Item 2: Presentation on Energy and Emissions Balance for Limerick (Pat Stephens, Limerick**

**Clare Energy Agency)**

Mr. Stephens gave a presentation on the preparation and findings of an energy emission

balance for Limerick City and County. LCCC/LCEA commissioned ARUP to carry out the energy

and emissions balance. The methodology used is based on national energy and emissions

data, analysed on a pro-rata population burden share basis for Limerick. The Limerick data

sits inside national methodology. He noted that while the commercial and industrial sectors

have achieved some efficiencies in recent years, the residential and transport sectors

represent the largest energy and emissions sectors at over 52%, and present the best

opportunities for private individuals to make savings in energy use for the future.

Cllr Scanlon thanked Mr. Stephens for his comprehensive report.

Cllr O’Brien thanked Mr. Stephens and asked from an agricultural perspective how do we

reduce our GHG emissions in real terms and maintain and strengthen our local economy in

real terms.---
Mr. Stephens, in reply, confirmed that the Energy & Emissions Balance only deals with the

energy element of agriculture. Some work has been done at examining how agricultural waste

can convert methane into energy using Anaerobic Digestion. He stated that the focus should

be on how we decarbonise energy in the building and transport sectors, and cited the example

of the decarbonisation zone proposed for the city centre. Integration of renewables at

building level, while challenging, will have to increase, because traditionally you don’t get

renewables built into the urban area.

Cllr O’Brien, in a follow on question noted that we mostly use fossil fuels and now there is a

push in Ireland to move to renewables, which can be unreliable.

Mr. Stephens, in reply, said there is a significant move towards renewables, and that Ireland

has recently increased the renewable electricity target to 80%. He agreed there are issues

with intermittency. For the foreseeable future, there are also some possible problems with

energy security, and that is why we are still reliant on Money Point and other power stations

to ensure energy security. One way of ensuring security using renewables is through biomass

fuel supply to Combined Heat & Power plants. He acknowledged that this had been

problematic for farmers in the past, but it must be part of a future solution

Ms. Hayes noted that the report was silent on data centres and in relation to emissions in

Limerick of existing centres. Ms Hayes is aware of planning for a new data centre in Ennis,

twice the size of any in Ireland so far. Ms Hayes queried why ARUP had not looked at any data

centres in Limerick and their potential impacts on energy requirements.

In response, Mr Stephens said since there was no data centre in Limerick to model, ARUP did

not model for specific energy consuming infrastructure like data centres. The report analysed

energy use across various sectors and matched that to our capacity to generate energy locally,

providing an understanding of the ability to generate local energy and what energy we want

to bring into a region. He noted that data centres in themselves are not specifically a bad

thing, as they are required in any transition to a low carbon economy, as we are reliant on

digital technology. However, it is important that data centres are energy efficient and can use

local renewable energy as their source.

Cllr Benson noted in relation to data centres that they are looking to offset their carbon

footprint. Cllr Benson does not think we are using environmental/social clauses sufficiently in

our procurement process. She commented on the need to focus on shorter supply chains and

a move back to renew and repair shops, to feed employment and activity back into local

communities.

Cllr Sheehan (J) thanked Mr. Stephens and commented that the conversation has moved on

a lot in relation to climate change and we need to bring people along with us.

He asked that as we are located on an estuary with tidal power and water to cool down the

data centres, should we be looking at strategic placement in the development plan to locate

data centres in proximity to the estuary. He also asked should we decompartmentalise areas

where peat use is low for those where it is high, to allow for the continuation of small-scale

peat extraction.---
Mr. Stephens, in reply, that the report focuses only on the amount of energy we are using,

not on the location of data centres. He commented that if you can usefully harness the River

Shannon it does make sense to look into it.

Mr. Stephens commented there is no major peat issue in Limerick. We have an issue with

biomass development, in that farmers were not traditionally treated well when encouraged

to get into the biomass industry. He argued that biomass a means of growing our thermal

and electrical energy, combined heat and power is a sector we need to revisit again r.

Cllr Scanlon queried how likely is the 50% reduction in residential use by 2030.

Mr Stephens, in reply, said the reduction in the residential sector is driven the need to

upgrade over 500,000 homes, by improving insulation and heating systems. The improvement

will be driven by two things: grant schemes and carbon tax.

Mr. Hoynes thanked Mr Stephens and proposed that collaboration at a regional level is vital

and monitoring of the data is important.

Cllr Sheehan (J) noted on the retrofitting of houses, that there have been a number of

complaints from tenants that have been retrofitted, that their electricity bills are now higher.

The issue of fuel poverty caused by carbon tax and that people might not be able to afford

deep retrofitting. Noted that Europe has a low cost rolling deep retrofit loan without the high

criteria of a high street bank.

Mr Stephens, in reply, will ask colleagues in housing about electricity issue.

**Item 3. Question submitted from Ms. Michelle Hayes**

Could the Council provide an update in relation to changes in recycling in Mungret? I

understand some recycling is now transferred to a Dublin based company, Panda, which has

been awarded the contract and involves transport to Dublin.

A. (i) What are the reasons for the change in contract?

(ii) Has there been any analysis of Carbon Footprint arising from this change.

B. In relation to consumables such as printer toner cartridges, would the Council consider a

facility to recycle these having regard to the reuse, repair, recycle aspirations of the Circular

Economy?

A response to the Question was circulated to the Members prior to the SPC meeting.

**Item 4. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery.**

“I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan district of Limerick that the Council do a

feasibility study on a large green area at the back of the Old Cork Road that runs the length of

4 housing estates to determine if a community facility such as a dog walking park can be

established in the area.”---
In proposing the motion, Cllr Slattery noted that the green space in question had no lighting,

no facilities for old/young people, and no uses. The area suffers from anti-social behavior.

She commented that is an awful waste of land that could be put to use as some kind of

recreational facility. Cllr Slattery stated that she is meeting with Carmel Lynch SSE on site, and

thanked the other Members for their support. The motion was seconded by Cllr Talukder,

who added that a cricket pitch should be a considered option for a multi-purposed space. Cllrs

Collins (B), Benson and Scanlon also supported the motion. Ms. Gallagher then read the reply.

“The Council would like to advise that a dog run area is currently being piloted in Mungret

Park. The purpose of the pilot is to gauge interest from the public in a dog park and also to

establish any issues that may arise with dog parks. This will be reviewed after the initial pilot

with a view to determining the feasibility of rolling out dog parks in other Council parks and

open spaces.

The Council will arrange an inspection of the site at the back of the Old Cork Road. The site

will be considered for community use and its suitability as a possible dog park.”

Ms Gallagher noted that LCCC would take all comments on board in regards to multi-

functional spaces.

Cllr Slattery thanked those who supported the motion, welcomed the response and reiterated

that the area needs to be a multi-purpose space.

**Item 5. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely (referred from the Metropolitan**

**District of Limerick held on 21****st** **June, 2021).**

“I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we phase out

the use of glyphosate / roundup, that we seek clarification on the extent of use of this

chemical from any contractors who provide weed control / spraying to Limerick City and

County Council and that of our own staff members also, given the possible health implications

of its use on wildlife, domestic pets and people. “

In proposing this motion, Cllr Kiely highlighted how LCCC have signed up as a partner to the

All-Ireland Pollinator Plan and commented that two actions under the Plan, Actions 19 and

20, reference reducing/eliminating pesticide usage. She stated that we are falling into a

pattern of using pesticides when they should really be used only when absolutely essential.

The Council need to minimize and do better and to educate people on what we are doing.

Cllr Benson seconded the motion.

Cllr Collins (B) supported the motion, stating it was very important to get it right. She

acknowledged, however, that there may be a place for herbicide on hard surfaces. The

additional physical labour requirements to implement alternatives to pesticide would be

difficult with staffing numbers. All operatives should be properly trained in the use of

pesticides.

Cllr Hartigan supported the motion and noted that he had spoken previously with Carmel

Lynch SEE and notes LCCC is moving in the right direction. He would like to see the weed-

spraying tender and process being reviewed.---
Ms Gallagher then read the reply:

“In 2020, we carried out a full review of where, how and why we use herbicide in the Council,

the quantities we use and the role of subcontractors. The objective was to identify

opportunities to reduce usage. The review found that glyphosate is not used

in large quantities, and only on hard surfaces for cleansing purposes and in our parks.

Since the review, it has been agreed that glyphosate will no longer be used in Council parks.

Its use in green space is being reviewed, however, the cost implications of moving to

alternative methods of control such as strimming will need to be factored in. The Council is

also considering the use of steel wire brushes on the street cleaning vehicles in certain

situations in the city. At present there is no viable alternative to weed killer on hard surfaces.

While it may not fully eliminate the use of Glyphosate in the short to medium term, we

believe there is scope to reduce its use significantly.”

Cllr Kiely thanked those who supported the motion and welcomed the reply. She

acknowledged the good work of Carmel Lynch SEE and her team in Parks.

The Chair advised that the next meeting is scheduled for 4pm on Tuesday 7 December, 2020.

The meeting then concluded.

NOTICES OF MOTION

4.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Carey

l will move at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District that either a Kilmallock Local

Area Plan Review or a variation to the ongoing Development Plan be introduced to facilitate

the re-zoning of a 3/4 acre site, adjacent to Super Valu Carpark, which is currently zoned a

residential development area into a commercial zoned area.

**Reply:**

The Local Area Plan for Kilmallock was adopted in 2019, following extensive consultation

with the public and Elected Members. Zoning cannot be considered in draft Limerick

Development Plan 2022-2028, as there is a standalone Local Area Plan in place for the town.

In light with Section 19(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). The

Planning Authority will commence the review of the Kilmallock Local Area Plan as soon as

resources permit.

**Councillor Carey requested a Special meeting be held regarding this issue, preceeded by a**

**workshop with the Planning Department to discuss this response. The Senior Staff Officer**

**advised that this request must be put in writing to the Chairperson and signed by 3 Elected**

**Members before proceeding.**

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District calling on

Limerick City and County Council to identify suitable locations for bus shelters in Kilfinane,

**Proposed: Councillor Donegan**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan**

**Reply:**

Active Travel will submit a grant application to the National Transport Authority (NTA) in

January 2022. We will include Kilfinane, Kilmallock and Bruff as well as potential locations---

6.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Egan

“I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that Limerick

City and County Council, in the proposed County Development Plan, accommodate farming

families and other local people, who preserved the heritage of Lough Gur down through the

years, to get Planning Permission for Housing on their lands in the Area.”

**Proposed : Councillor Egan**

**Seconded: Councillor Mitchell**

**Reply:**

The Council are currently preparing the Draft Development plan 2022-2028. Objective LCA

O5 of the Draft Plan, sets out that development within the Lough Gur Special Control Area

will be restricted, including residential development, except in exceptional circumstances.

Lough Gur is one of the most significant archeological sites in Limerick and the Draft Plan

seeks to safeguard the unique setting of Lough Gur. Each planning application will be

considered on a case by case basis, based on the individual circumstances and also in

compliance with Rural Housing policies set out in the Draft Plan and national and regional

policies.

QUESTIONS

7.Question submitted by Councillor Carey

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District for an update

regarding any expressions of interest in the Kilmallock Business Park

**Reply:**

We had one expression of interest so far which was passed on to Powers about a month

ago. We had held off promoting Kilmallock/Bruree until EI had approved funding for the

food development hub at Bruree as this will be a big attraction for food companies to that

area. That funding was approved two weeks ago and we will be formally announcing our

food strategy at the Re-Ignite conference at the Strand Hotel on the 24th November next.

**Reply:**

As at Thursday 11th November the total number of dwellings shown as ‘vacant’ in Kilmallock

Town was four.

One of these units though recorded as vacant is being used for temporary tenancy die to fire

damage to the tenants original dwelling.

One has had the works recently finished and is now available for allocation and is being

Two units require major refurbishment.

These are currently being scoped to determine the extent of works required.

The two units which are ‘vacant but available for letting’ include one which is in the process

of being allocated and the other is being used as a temporary letting due to fire damage to

the tenants original dwelling.

The two units described as other refer to old records of demountable units – these records

have to be updated and will be undertaken after an inspection is arranged locally.

The ten units requiring minor repairs are returned locally.

On average these units take three to four months to return depending upon the amount of

work to be completed. The local Housing Maintenance Team or external contractors

complete these works.

Of the ten units requiring major refurbishment:

o Seven of the units are being advanced through the Category 3 and 4 Lots

o One is a Demountable Unit

o One unit has yet to determined as to the most appropriate approach to managing the

property

o One is being assessed for other options to return

The process by which these units are being completed is as follows. Each property is

assessed in detail to ‘scope’ the nature and extent of the works required to be completed.

A cost estimate based upon this scoping is then prepared.

A bundle of units is then included in a specific Lot and a submission is made to the DHLGH to

go to tender for the works.

Subject to approval the Lot is then tendered in an open competition. Approval to proceed is

then sought. A preferred contractor is then identified to undertake the works. It is

estimated that the time for works completion will take 6 months from appointment.

Contingent upon no unforeseen delays the dwellings should be ready for reletting by

November 2022.

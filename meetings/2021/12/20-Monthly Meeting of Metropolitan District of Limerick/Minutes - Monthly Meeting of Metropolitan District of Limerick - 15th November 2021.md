License conditions for the Castletroy Waste Water Treatment Plant with results published

on the Irish Water website in the form of an Annual Environmental Report.

Monitoring Programme to satisfy the Water Framework Directive at Athlunkard Bridge,

Parteen Bridge, Castleconnell and Annacotty.

3. Limerick City and County Council undertake sampling and analysis of private water

supplies (Group Water Supplies and small private supplies) as part of an Annual Monitoring

Programme under the Drinking Water Regulations.

4. Limerick City and County Council provide sampling and analysis of private wells on

request as part of the assessment process for the Well Grant administered by the Council

on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under the Housing

(Private Water Supply Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020.

In relation to water quality monitoring at Corbally Baths, Limerick City and County Council

undertakes sampling fortnightly during the bathing season (mid May to mid-September)

and has done so since May 2019. The Bathing Water Regulations require four years of

microbiological testing in order to perform an indicative assessment of the water quality at

this location for bathing. Currently the water quality is of “poor” quality and therefore not

satisfying the limits set out in the Bathing Water Regulations.

A Surface and Storm water Strategic Assessment is currently being undertaken by

Consultants on behalf of Limerick City and County Council with Corbally Baths included as

a Priority Area. This assessment provides for additional sampling, over a 3-month period,

at locations upstream of the Baths to establish if the sources of contamination can be

established.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, when are the lights going***

***to be installed in Mungret Park.***

**REPLY**: For reasons of public safety, the current opening times in all of the Parks accord with

seasonal day light hours, which extend up to 9pm during the summer months.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, when are lights going to***

***be installed in Vartry Field.***

**REPLY**: The current opening times in all of the Parks accord with seasonal day light hours, which

extend up to 9pm during the summer months.

While upgrading the Vartry Field earlier this year, ducting for lighting was installed around

the perimeter of the field. The ducting was provided in order to future proof the project,

should funding become available at some stage for the provision of lighting in our amenities.

However, there is currently no funding source for this lighting.

17.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, have we a timeframe as to***

***when the cameras in Altimara Court will be replaced following on from the damage caused to it***

***recently.***

**REPLY**: This camera was recently damaged following vandalism.

This camera had been in place for an extended period and did not have its own permanent

infrastructure.

This camera was of a temporary type that was not being monitored. It was installed prior

to the introduction of GDPR.

It is not proposed to replace the camera at this time. If it were to be replaced it would

require a process to demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements. This would require

a DPIA to be completed given the fact that it would by necessity be upgraded (replacement).

The CCTV Policy at present is that pending review no new cameras are being installed. This

would be considered as a new camera as the requirement for DPIA would have to be

completed.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, given the fact that funding***

***has been set aside for the refurbishment of the Black Bridge in Plassey when will the necessary***

**REPLY**: Waterways Ireland have informed us that they are working in partnership with Clare County

Council & Limerick City and County Council as well as other agencies (ESB etc.) and are

currently undertaking a feasibility and route selection process for a possible Limerick to

Scarriff Greenway. The possible routes for the Greenway envisage the restoration and re-

opening of the Black Bridge and its use as a crossing of the Shannon for the Greenway. The

feasibility and route selection process is due to be finalised in April 2022.

While the restoration of the Black Bridge is included in the Limerick City & County Council

3-year Capital Programme, however progression of this restoration is dependent on

securing a funding source.

basis. Active faults, malfunction and vandalism associated with signal apparatus on the

street is attended to within four hours. Urgent or ‘all out’ faults are attended to within one

hour.

An examination of system operation and records indicate that all traffic signals at this

location are operating fault free and in compliance with Road Traffic Regulations. No system

operation faults have been recorded at this location, which would contribute to road safety

hazard for road users.

Limerick City and County Council Traffic Department is recently aware of a high incidence

Road. Limerick City and County Council Traffic Department have advised the Gardai, as

Traffic Authority, of this development and have requested Garda examination.

The Safe Routes to Schools Programme has a dedicated Infrastructure Officer who will set

up a meeting with St Patrick’s Girls School and the Active Travel Team to discuss required

safety measure.

Members expressed their dissatisfaction with the reply and referred to recent accidents that had

taken place at this location, and that the sequencing of traffic lights need to be reviewed given

the volumes of traffic at this junction. They agreed that Garda enforcement measures also

needed to be provided at the junction. Members requested that a Meeting would be held on site,

comprising the Members from the Electoral Area, and Council Officials to discuss and review the

issue.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

Briefings to discuss the costings for same and possible funding streams for lighting.

**REPLY**: The current opening times in all of the Parks accord with seasonal day light hours, which

extend up to 9pm during the summer months.

As the winter months approach, the opening hours are reduced over a number of weeks

resulting in earlier closing times, in line with corresponding reduction in daylight hours.

This earlier closing time is required to ensure that all park users have exited the Park

before it gets dark, as there is currently no lighting in Mungret Park.

In order for the Council to consider extending its opening hours, funding would have to be

sourced to provide for lighting. There is currently no funding source for the provision of

lighting in Parks.

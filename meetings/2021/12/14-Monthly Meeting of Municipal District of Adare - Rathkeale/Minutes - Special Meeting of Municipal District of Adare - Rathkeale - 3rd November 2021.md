**To discuss Pallaskenry Housing Scheme**

Members expressed frustration and concern that a change in circumstances regarding

the Council’s purchase of 16 houses in Pallaskenry and the proposed purchase of this

scheme by Focus Ireland.

The Director, Housing informed Members the current developer cannot now deliver the

houses as per the original fixed price contract and Limerick City and County Council are

not in a position to increase monies in order to complete the project. The Senior

Executive Officer, Strategy & Non LA Housing Construction advised Members Focus

Ireland have more flexibility in this regard and if awarded the contract, they would be

able to provide a quick turnaround to finish and allocate the houses by March 2022.

Following discussion, the Cathaoirleach asked the Executive of Limerick City and County

Council to arrange a meeting between elected Members, the Executive and Focus

Ireland to discuss allocation management of the housing scheme.

**To receive an update on the Adare Fountain**

The Executive Architect, Property Support Placemaking circulated a report and

proceeded to brief Members on the Adare Fountain, which he stated represented good

value for money and explained the initial project was to repair the fountain and provide

additional seating in the area, which was estimated at the time of the Town and Village

Renewal Scheme application process would cost in the region of €80,000. During the

course of the detailed design, it became apparent that further works were needed to

complete the project and included new mechanical and electrical works as well as

additional landscape, paving and ramp installation beside the existing steps.

Discussion ensued and while Members were all in agreement that a very good job was

done on the fountain some Members expressed serious concerns on the overall cost of

the project and asked the Executive if something could be put in place to prevent this

type of overspend occurring in future project.

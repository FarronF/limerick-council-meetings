 A number of footpath upgrades were requested for the following areas:

Fedamore, Crecora, Banogue and Churchview Estate. The Senior Executive

Engineer advised these would be considered when the Schedule of Municipal

District Works is brought before Members in 2022.

could be considered under future Active Travel Programmes.

Improvement Works. The Senior Executive Engineer advised that Topographical

surveys were due to be carried out shortly. Consultants had also been appointed

to do Preliminary Designs and costings so that these Junctions could be

forwarded to the Department for future funding consideration.

 Councillor Sheahan advised lack of parking in Ballyneety needed to be looked at.

 The lack of street cleaning in all areas of the District was discussed. The Senior

Executive Engineer advised Members that it is difficult to commit staff to street

cleaning as their priority is to implement the road works schedule.

 Councillor Collins raised the issue of the lack of awareness around the disposal of

cigarette butts and suggested the issue be forwarded to the Environmental

Strategic Policy Committee of Limerick City and County Council and request a

policy or awareness campaign specifically targeting the disposal of cigarette butts

be compiled. Councillor Sheahan added plastic bottles disposal should be

included in this request.

**Traffic Calming at Pallaskenry National School**

Members made reference to a petition they had received regarding Traffic calming at

Pallaskenry National school. The Senior Executive Engineer advised Members the

National Transport Authority had published a Safe Routes to School programme which

had been circulated to all National Schools in the Country to enable them to apply for

funding for traffic calming works and added that only two Schools in the District had

applied for funding under this programme. The Senior Executive Engineer also advised

that any Traffic Calming interventions need to comply with Councils Traffic Calming Policy.

This requires (1) Speed Surveys to justify any interventions and (2) A Plebiscite of residents

in favour of any Traffic Calming proposals. The Executive Engineer advised Members a

speed count would be carried out in the vicinity of Pallaskenry National School to ascertain

if traffic calming was required in the area and added that the Safe Routes to School

programme was a means of activating funding for these type of works.---

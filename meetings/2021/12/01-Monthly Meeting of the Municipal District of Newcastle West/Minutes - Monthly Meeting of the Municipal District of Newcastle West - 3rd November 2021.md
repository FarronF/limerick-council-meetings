Deputation

The Cathaoirleach welcomed representatives from Meadow Court Residents Association. The

Deputation consisted of Mr. Eamonn Walshe and Mr. Alan Donegan.

Mr. Walshe thanked the Members for the opportunity to address the Meeting.

He outlined the traffic and parking issues at the estate at school finishing times due to the

proximity of a nearby secondary school. He also noted a number of issues with the Snicket, a

laneway connecting Meadowcourt to Boherbui road. A presentation was given which showed

cars parking illegally in people’s driveways, cars being driven over resident’s lawns and

pedestrians having to pass cars on the roadway as cars were parked on footpaths within the

estate. He noted that there was no respect for residents living within the estate by people

collecting their children from the school.

He advised that the Gardai had been contacted regarding the illegal parking and damage to a

resident’s garden. He also noted that the school is to seek planning permission for additional

classrooms, which will add to existing illegal parking and traffic congestion issues for residents

of Meadow Court and neighbouring estates. There is also a concern that the traffic issues

could lead to accidents.

He also noted the anti social behaviour at the Snicket along with illegal dumping and littering

and the need to repair gullies along the laneway.

The Residents are purposing a number of solutions to address the issues for the consideration

of the Council

 Gate to be provided at the Snicket with regulated opening and closing times

 Cctv for the area

 Introduction of Parking Bye Laws for the estate

 Engagement by the school with the residents, Local Authority

 Last resort would be to close off the Snicket laneway

Mr. Walshe did note that the majority of the residents did not want to see the Snicket closed.

He also noted that it would take time for the matters outlined to be addressed.

The Members thanked the delegation for their attendance and advised that the matters

raised would be considered and the Council will write a detailed response to the Residents

Association in due course.---

The Members noted the proposed school extension and the need for traffic management to

form part of this. It was also noted that the school will need to co-operate and that the Gardai

have a role to play also with regard to illegal parking.

Following further discussion, it was agreed that the Senior Executive Engineer would make

contact with the Principal of the school and the Gardaí. The Executive Engineer, Roads, noted

that the Snicket laneway is cleaned on a weekly basis and this would continue. He also

noted that the gullies on the laneway would be repaired.

(a) and (b) How many council owned houses are vacant in Abbeyfeale, Athea, Mountcollins,

Tournafulla and Templeglantine (b) how long are each vacant.

As at October 22nd the table below sets out the information the requested information for

parts (a) and (b)

It should be noted that 11 of the 19 units recorded as vacant in Abbeyfeale are in the

process of being transferred to an Approved Housing Body, AHB.

(Image omitted)---
5

The total number of vacant properties is 23, 7 out of 23 are category 1/2 and 15 are category

3/4, 1 is not yet inspected.

There is one other property in Abbeyfeale which has yet to be categorised but is vacant and

is adjacent to an existing category 3 dwelling.

(c) Category 1 and 2 units (7 in total) will be returned on a rolling basis for reletting by

February.

On average these units take three to four months to return depending upon the amount of

work to be completed. The local Housing Maintenance Team or external contractors

complete these works.

Category 3 and 4 units (4 in total – allowing for the removal of the 11 AHB units from the

figure) will be returned by November 2022.

The process by which these units are being completed is as follows.

Each property is assessed in detail to scope the nature and extent of the works required to be

completed.

A cost estimate based upon this scoping is then prepared.

A bundle of units is then included in a specific Lot and a submission is then made to the DHLGH

for funding and approval to go to tender for the works (this is a combined 1 to 3 submission).

Subject to approval the Lot is then tendered in an open competition. A preferred contractor

is then identified to undertake the works. It is estimated that the time for works completion

will take 6 months from appointment.

Contingent upon no unforeseen delays the dwellings should be ready for reletting by

November 2022.

One further property in the Abbeyfeale area is currently being assessed to identify viable

options.

It should be noted that even though wastewater treatment capacity may be available at

the various IW plants an application procedure has to be followed before any connection

agreement is settled.

The process requires that a Pre Connection enquiry is made to IW at the early stage of

feasibility assessment. This is then technically assessed. Subject to no constraints being

identified and technical agreement being reached then a Connection Agreement is entered

into for the scheme.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting that the road in the Rays Mountcollins be included in this***

***year’s budget**.***

REPLY:

Following a review of the works for Rays in Mountcollins, funding cannot be

committed to this estate this year within the current budget available. The

valuation for the road surfacing of circa €40k does not represent value for

money for the number of housing units on this road. Funding will be looked at

in future years.---

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next Meeting when will the Athea flood defences be completed.***

REPLY:

An advance application has been made to An Bórd Pleanála for the removal of gravels from

the river in Athea. This application and associated NIS were submitted to An Bórd Pleanála in

May 2021. The current date for decision from ABP is November 2021 but as instream works

are restricted from July 1st to September 30th, these works cannot progress until summer of

2022 (subject to planning approval).

progress of the project and if there is any application currently with the OPW for approval at

present for works on the flood defences at Athea.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Sheahan

***I will ask at the next Meeting what works the Office of Public Works have scheduled for***

***the Newcastle West Municipal District for the year 2022.***

REPLY:

Athea FRS is currently being progressed by Limerick City and County Council as one of the

OPW Funded CFRAM Tranche 1 Approved schemes for Limerick. A separate response has

been prepared to a Question on this Scheme.

There is one proposed scheme submitted for OPW Funded Minor Works funding approval at

Gardenfield, Monagea and, subject to being approved, these works will be progressed by

LCCC Operations in 2022.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***when our Authority (a) intend to clean up its derelict properties***

***in Newcastle West, (b) is funding earmarked to restore these houses for habitation and (c)***

***what is the precise timeframe for home offers to would be tenants.***---
11

REPLY:

Within the context of the question ‘derelict’ is taken as referring to category 3 and 4 units

though a distinction is noted in the categorisations.

As background, category 3 dwellings require a deep retrofit which will involve works to the

building envelope such as external wall insulation, internal wall insulation, attic insulation,

floors, windows, mechanical and electrical installations, Internal joinery and stairs, bathroom,

plastering and extension.

Category 4 units can require the works outlined in category three, plus structural works i.e.

roofs and envelope repairs, damage from fire water ingress etc. These can be referred to as

“derelict.”

As at October 22nd there are 41 units categorised as vacant in the MD with 1 unit to be

inspected.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

West GMA Budget 2022**.**

14.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the likely reopening of Brewery Lane,***

***Newcastle West.***

REPLY:

Brewery Lane is a private laneway.

As agreed at a meeting of the Municipal District of Newcastle West, the process of declaring

the laneway a public road, in accordance with Section 11, Roads Act, 1993, was commenced

in 2020. Limerick City and County Council advertised its intention to consider the making of a

Declaration that Brewery Lane be a public road, by way of Notification on the Council website

along with advertisements in the Limerick Leader and Weekly Observer. The public

consultation period was from Friday, 17th January to Friday, 14th February, 2020 and the

period for submissions extended until Friday, 28th February, 2020.

A number of submissions were received from persons in the vicinity of the laneway which

included requests that if the laneway was declared a public road that it be closed each evening

and opened each morning. Concerns about anti social behaviour, access and parking on the

laneway were also raised.

A report on the process and the submissions was brought to the District Meeting of 4th March,

2020 for the consideration of the Members as the Declaring of a Public Road under Section

11 of the Roads Act 1993 is a reserved function. No decision was reached at this meeting and

the item was deferred for further consultation.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the Senior Executive Engineer should consult with

those who made submissions along with stakeholders in the vicinity with a view to taking

the laneway in charge, maintenance works and re-opening it for public access. An update

on this, will be given by the Senior Executive Engineer at the December Meeting of the

District.

NOTICES OF MOTION

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin---

***I will move at the next Meeting that this district review/reduce our speed limits on all our***

***cul de sac roads to 50kph as 80- 100 is totally inappropriate.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

As this request is a change of Council policy with regard to cul de sac roads, it

should be referred to the Travel and Transportation SPC for consideration.

The speed limit policy on cul de sac roads should be similar for all districts

within the County.

Following discussion, it was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would refer this Notice

of Motion to the Travel and Transportation SPC for consideration.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council take ownership of the remaining stretch of***

***the L70553 which is only 100 meters long. The question should be asked as to why this has***

***not been done as the Council down the years used to repair same.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The 100m on the L70553 noted above is a private roadway. If repair works

are required on this roadway, residents can apply for a Local Improvement

Scheme (LIS).

of roadway comprising of 100 metres at Ballymurrough, Newcastle West and requested

that this section of road be taken in charge by the Council.

Council and would be a welcome addition to the infrastructure supporting

the Limerick Greenway. Preliminary design work has been undertaken and

the proposal will be further examined by the Active Travel Unit within the

Transportation and Mobility Directorate. Consultation with bus operators

will take place as part of the design process.---
14

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the demand for a bus stop at Barnagh

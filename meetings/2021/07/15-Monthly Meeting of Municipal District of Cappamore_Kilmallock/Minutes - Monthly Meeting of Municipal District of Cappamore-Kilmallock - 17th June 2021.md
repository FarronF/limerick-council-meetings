QUESTIONS

4.Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that Portaloos

be placed outside Playgrounds and areas of consistent gatherings in the Cappamore-

Kilmallock District until such time toilets are provided in County Limerick where needed.”

**REPLY:**

In relation to Playgrounds, at present it is not considered that Portaloos are necessary

notwithstanding the current level of use, however, the Council will keep it under review and

should the situation change, the Council can revisit the proposal. As local facilities continue

to re-open in line with the continued easing of restrictions the need for temporary Portaloos

is lessening.

5.Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

“I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that road

signs be inspected in the Cappamore-Kilmallock District and are fit for purpose in the

interests of safety.”

**REPLY:**

The Road signs are erected in accordance with Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs manual which is

a national guidance document. If Councillor Mitchell could give specific concerns and

identify locations where he feels there is a signage issue, we will review the signage to

ensure it complies with National Policy.

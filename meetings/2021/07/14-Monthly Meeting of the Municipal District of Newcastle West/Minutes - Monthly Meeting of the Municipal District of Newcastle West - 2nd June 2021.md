QUESTIONS

6.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting that flashing speed reduction electronic signs be erected at***

***Cullinagh, Newcastle West on the N21 where the speed limit signage starts.***

REPLY:

This request has been forwarded to the TII for consideration as the location is

on the N21 National Primary route. We are currently awaiting a response.

7.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting that this Council consider from a forward planning perspective,***

***cluster type development of houses, near our towns and villages where there is no adequate***

***sewerage capacity in our rural communities. This has been done very successfully in other***

***counties.***

REPLY:

The principle of cluster type developments in the open countryside would be contrary to

National, Regional and Local policy, all of which aim to develop more sustainable climate

resilient compact communities though promoting renewal and revitalisation of our towns and

villages. Directing cluster type developments into our towns and villages, where the houses

can connect to the public sewer or individual wastewater treatment plants, will improve the

vitality and vibrancy of these settlements and should therefore be encouraged.

Private mini wastewater treatment systems (WWTPs) serving multiple users are extremely

problematic as it is impossible to ensure on-going operations and maintenance. As Irish

Water will not retrospectively take over mini WWTP’s, the significant cost of dealing with this

issue falls on the Local Authority.

In addition, it is technically very difficult to manage large discharges to ground and discharges

to surface waters would not be permitted because none of the surface waters in the county

has any assimilative capacity for phosphorus. Therefore allowing discharges to surface waters

would be contrary to the Water Framework Directive.

Experience from other Local Authorities who permitted these types of developments in the

past is that the housing clusters were abandoned by the developer or Management Company

and were not being operated or maintained to necessary performance standards. Due to the

legacy of issues with these types of developments, other Local Authorities have a

presumption against communal treatment plants.

Councillor Ruddle expressed dissatisfaction at the response received and noted that people

are having difficulty sourcing housing and that this proposal could be one solution to the lack

of housing availability.

8.

Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

***I will ask at the next Meeting can a footpath be put in place at O’Connell Cross, Ardagh to***

***Ardvone Cross where the R523 joins the L1333. This is already half complete and there is***

***some kerbing there as well.***

REPLY:

This work will be carried out as part of the proposed Active Travel works for

Ardagh village which are to be completed later this year.

The provision of another footpath from O’Connell’s Cross along the Shanagolden road which

was raised previously was also discussed.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the*** ***next Meeting for an update on (a) the survey for Lee’s Cross and the***

***programme of works which was to be prepared (b) the cost of the proposed works along***

***with a detailed plan of the works (c) how much has been spent to date on this junction.***

REPLY:

A feasibility study on the proposed junction improvement works for Lee’s Cross

is currently being completed and included in this will be a detailed design along

with an estimated cost of the proposed junction improvements.

The existing road surface and road markings were upgraded in 2020 at a cost

of €60,000.

Councillor Galvin referred to the survey for Lee’s Cross and asked for an update on the

Feasibility study to be provided when complete.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting what is the remaining capacity of the sewerage treatment***

***plant in Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:

Please note below the response received from Irish Water.

Abbeyfeale Wastewater Treatment Plant has 391 PE (population equivalent)

capacity remaining: approx 145 no. housing units at this time. The available

capacity may change as new Connection Agreements are put in place between

Applicants/Developers and Irish Water.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor F. Foley

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the unfinished houses at Cois na Feile,***

***Abbeyfeale.***

REPLY:
---

The Housing Development Directorate of Limerick City and County Council issued publicly an

Expression of Interest on e-tenders (ref: 188993) on the 23rd April 2021 for the acquisition

and activation of an unfinished housing estate at: Cois na Feile, Clash, Abbeyfeale.

The Expression of Interest deadline was 4pm on the 10th May 2021.

An Evaluation Panel was convened on the 13th May 2021 to assess the information received

against the assessment criteria that was included in the original Expression of Interest briefing

document.

Details on members of the Panel are contained within the table below.

**Name**

**Position/Role**

Sarah Newell

Acting Senior Executive Planner, Housing

Development Directorate, Limerick City and

County Council

Suzie Clifford

Administrative Officer, Housing

Development Directorate, Limerick City and

County Council

Aoife Duke

Aoife Duke, Director of Service, Housing

Development Directorate, Limerick City and

County Council

The evaluation clearly showed an advantageous submission from which the Evaluation Panel

was able to base their recommendation.

Cluid Housing, an Approved Housing Body, was identified as the preferred submission.

Limerick City and County Council will now progress a formal transfer process subject to

agreement on valuations and the section 183 process.

12.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting when works incorporating the provision of pedestrian***

***crossings along the R522 at North Road and Liscarroll Road, Dromcolloger will take place.***

REPLY:

With respect to Dromcollogher, a number of Pedestrian Crossings are identified as part of the

Dromcollogher Draft Public Realm Plan.

The location of these proposed pedestrian crossings is an integral part of the Draft Plan which

is likely to go to Public Consultation during 2021.

Construction of Pedestrian Crossings at this stage is premature pending an agreed Public

Realm Plan.
---
8

In the interim, a source of funding needs to be identified for any proposed justified pedestrian

crossings.

In addition, suitable locations needs to be assessed as expenditure is dependent on the

amount of associated civil works required.

13.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting*** ***as to what progress has been made with regard to the***

***provision of a footpath along the R520 linking the Kerry Co-Op premises towards the***

***speed limit sign at Clooneyscheane.***

REPLY:

The provision of a footpath, drainage, public lighting and river embankment protection would

involve significant expenditure and would also involve land acquisition at the above location.

An updated cost estimate based on the requirement for a detailed design along with a

retaining wall with stone facing could incur expenditure in the region of €300,000 to complete

the requested works.

Also this request would be subject to land acquisition and a source of funding needs to be

identified for provision of this footpath over a distance of 500m serving 7 houses.

Liaison with Inland Fisheries Ireland and the OPW is also necessary due to the close proximity

of the River Arra to the Regional Road R520.

Part 8 Planning is also required due to the extent of the works involved.

Given the above cost and constraints, it would be difficult to justify a footpath at this location.

Councillor Scanlan referred to the cost involved in the provision of a footpath at the above

location and asked that contact be made with Kerry Group on this matter. In replying, the

Executive Engineer referred to the significant expenditure and constraints involved in the

provision of a footpath at this location.

14.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for updates on (a) the action required in the interest of safety***

***along the R522 at Ardnacrohy and (b) that the installation of a flashing speed indicator at***

***or near the speed limit sign on the Southern side of Feohanagh village.***

REPLY:
---
9

**(a)**This matter was referred to An Garda Siochána for consideration and the Gardai have

advised that they have carried out a number of speed checkpoints on the roadway.

However they have also advised that there are few if any places to conduct a speed

checkpoint safely on the road in question.

Prior to a Garda member establishing a speed CP they need to risk assess the location.

This is mandatory, as the safe conductions of speed checks is vital for the safety, not

only of the members conducting the speed checks, but also the members of the public

using the roads. A number of units have been tasked with speed check duty since the

report was originally issued, and they have all reported the same difficulties.

As recently as the 19th May 2021, two speed checkpoints were carried out on this

stretch of road, however safely conducting same is extremely difficult. At best, an

attempt can be made to clock speeding vehicles at a very short range, and then a

traffic stop can only take place following a pursuit of the vehicle. Given the nature of

the roadway, this option is considered high risk. Checkpoints cannot be conducted in

high risk dangerous areas where their safety and that of the public, is in any way

compromised.

It has been queried if the Council had any adjoining land to the route, then a dedicated

Garda layby spot would prove useful in enforcing high visibility traffic monitoring

(Speed/MIT/Crime). Alternatively, Go-Safe previously conducted checks on this

stretch of road, but now have no suitable locations to do so and it has been suggested

that possible locations could be further explored with people living along this route.

**(b)**

The flashing speed limit sign for this area has been ordered and will be erected once

delivered.

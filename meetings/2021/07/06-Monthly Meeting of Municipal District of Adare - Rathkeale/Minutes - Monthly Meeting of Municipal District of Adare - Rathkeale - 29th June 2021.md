**Mid West National Road Design Office**

**Proposed** **Footpath from Murphy’s Cross to the Traffic Lights in Adare Village &**

**Proposed N20 Banogue Traffic Calming Scheme**

The Meetings Administrator advised Members, as per email from the Senior Engineer,

Mid West Road Design Office, their request for an update on the funding for the proposed

footpath from Murphy’s Cross to the Traffic Lights in Adare Village should go directly to

TII. Councillor Teskey proposed a Special Meeting be convened to facilitate TII. This was

seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue and agreed.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the A/Senior Executive Engineer, Mid West Road Design

Office to the Meeting who had joined remotely. The A/Senior Executive Engineer

provided Members an update on the progress of the N20 Banogue Traffic Calming Scheme

which was almost completed pending ESB lighting connection and was hopeful that this

will be completed by the end of the current week.

Discussion ensued and the following issues were raised:

 Councillor O’Donoghue queried if the current location of the pedestrian crossing,

which is directly in front of the entrance to the service station, which is causing

difficulty for motorists entering the business. The A/Senior Executive Engineer

advised this was deemed to be the best location for the pedestrian crossing to

allow motorists to enter the service station.

 Councillor O’Donoghue raise the issue of the layout of the footpath and junction

on the Cork side of the service station impeding large vehicles from turning right.

The A/Senior Executive Engineer advised there should be no issues at this junction

as it is large enough for agricultural vehicles and the layout meets current

standards.

 Councillor O’Donoghue also queried why flashing speed limit signs were not put

in prior to traffic calming measures. The A/Senior Executive Engineer advised

these signs would only be erected in an area where there is no traffic calming

measures in place. A number of studies were carried out on the N20 at Banogue

prior to the installation of traffic calming measures and due to a number of
---
3

incidents in the area throughout the years it was agreed, due to the high risk for

pedestrians, that traffic calming measures would be more beneficial.

 Councillor O’Donoghue queried the total cost of the project. The A/Senior

Executive Engineer advised the Contract was for €540,000, although the final

costings have not yet been completed they are still on target for this amount.

 Councillor Keary queried if cameras at the beginning and end of the location would

be more effective than flashing speed limit signs. Councillor Teskey asked that

cameras be considered for all future schemes. The A/Senior Executive Engineer

advised he would relay the information back to the TII’s Safety Section.

**Operations and Maintenance Services**

**Special Speed Limits Housing Estates (Jake’s Law)**

The Senior Executive Engineer, Service Operations West Division briefed Members on the

proposed introduction of special speed limit bylaws for Meadowlea, Ballyhahill, Ashgard

Cove, Loughill and Orchard Avenue, Rathkeale housing estates in the District. It is

proposed the current speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour be reduced to 30 kilometres

per hour under Jake’s Law, following the death of Jake Brennan who was fatally injured in

a traffic collision outside his home in a housing estate in Kilkenny in 2014. The Senior

Executive Enginner proposed, following Members approval, the plans would go to public

consultation with all other Districts and then to Full Council for adoption. The proposals

were noted by Members.

under the remit of the Parks Department. He also advised there are grants

available to local communities who wish to carry out grass cutting in their areas.

Councillor Teskey requested Carmel Lynch from the Parks Department attend the

July District Meeting to discuss. Councillor Collins added that it is difficult for

community groups to avail of the current grant scheme as it is now a requirement

to have insurance cover in place before the grant can be availed of.

 Councillor Teskey also advised grass cutting needs to be carried out at all

junctions on the N69 and N21. The Senior Executive Engineer advised the tender

for this is done by Central Services and it is due to start on 30th June. Councillor

Road, Adare and Loughill Village. The Senior Executive Engineer advised this was an

exceptional case as the review was needed to facilitate the new school and distributor

road in Croom.

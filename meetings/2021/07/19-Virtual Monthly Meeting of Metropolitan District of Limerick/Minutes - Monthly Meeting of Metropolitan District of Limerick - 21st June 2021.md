**4.Strategic Housing Development (SHD) Application to An Bord Pleanála at Punches Cross,**

**Limerick**

The A/Senior Executive Officer, Planning and Environmental Services gave a presentation to the

Members on the proposed Strategic Housing Development Application and briefed the Members

on the content of the proposed application.

Following a detailed discussion of the application, the Members highlighted the following in---
3

relation to the application:

• Scale of development-a key issue is the visual impact on the Architectural Conservation Area

and the impact on natural light for existing adjoining properties;

• The number of storeys proposed is excessive, the proposed development is dominant and

overbearing and the height and density is not fitting to the area. Members also noted that the

Goatstown Strategic Housing Development on the Southside of Dublin had been recently

refused by An Bord Pleanála for similar reasons;

• Insufficient car parking proposed-students attending the local Mary Immaculate College and

elsewhere drive from outside Limerick and may use buses, bicycles etc. while in Limerick but

concerns were raised as to where do they park their cars. This may cause problems for the

residents of the local area as students may start parking their cars there;

• There is a limited number of tree stands shown on the landscape plan and the development

needs to be well landscaped so that there isn’t the possibility of a “skate park” being created

to the front of the development;

• Concerns were raised as to what is the potential for a change of use of the development in

the future. Could one of the conditions be that a change of use cannot be applied for in the

future? Any Build To Rent proposal should be used for association with college students only

and not for private rental;

• Was appropriate assessment screening adequately carried at the development location?

• Health and safety concerns were also raised because the development location was

previously an old petrol station and quarry site, so had underground petrol tanks been

decommissioned and the environmental impacts properly assessed?

• In relation to the student demand and concentration report, while there is a need for

development to free up housing in the area, what will happen to the development in the

future? Reference was made to the fact that Courtbrack Student Accommodation had

subsequently changed use to a direct provision centre and was now currently derelict;

• Traffic concerns were also flagged in that with three lanes being proposed on the Rosbrien

Road, that traffic from Edward Street will have difficulty pulling out onto Rosbrien Road. It was

suggested that maybe a roundabout would work better or could entry only off Rosbrien Road

be considered?

• Some residents had difficulty uploading their observations to the website;

• How would management of the development be organised to deal with any possible issues of

anti-social behaviour inside and outside of the development, and would 24 hour security be

provided?

• Have issues raised in relation to the previous application been addressed?

• Reference was made to other positive developments completed in the area recently, such as

Templeville housing estate or the LIDL shop, and it was important for this site to be developed

in sympathy to these developments.

The Elected Members requested that a summary of their comments would be circulated to them

to ensure that their comments had been accurately captured, before they were submitted to An

Bord Pleanála and the A/Senior Executive Officer, Planning and Environmental Services agreed to

circulate this summary to the Members.---

**QUESTIONS**

**5.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a total figure for***

***vacant site levies charged in January 2019, January 2020 and January 2021 in respect of the***

***corresponding 12 month charge period and what, if any, measures have been taken to collect***

***these charges and if Limerick City and County Council have placed any charges on these lands in***

**REPLY**: In accordance with Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 the total amount of Vacant

Levies charged by LCCC for 2019 was €506,45O and 2020 was €582,050. There are currently

three appeals with the Property Valuation Tribunal and in accordance with Urban Regeneration

and Housing Act 2015 levy demands cannot be issued until the appeals are determined. The

collection of the Vacant Site Levies is being transferred to the Debt Management Unit who will

actively pursue the collection of the outstanding Vacant Site Levies. Under Section 19 of Urban

Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 as the levies remain due and owing there is a charge on the

sites concerned.

**given that the majority of this land still remains vacant?**

**d.Did any elected representatives make representations on behalf of the owners of these**

**sites?**

**REPLY**:

a. The site was placed on the Vacant Site Register in June 2018. However, an administrative error

**7.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a full list of sites by***

***reason why they were not included i.e. VS- 001-17 to VS-041-17 inclusive and any others that***

***were given a VS code.***

**REPLY**: LCCC identified 19 potential vacant sites. The owners of each site were notified by way of

letter that outlined the reasons the site was considered a vacant site under the legislation and the

intention of LCCC to enter the site on the Vacant Site Register. In accordance with the Urban

Regeneration & Housing Act 2015, property owners had the right to make a submission to the

Council in writing within 28 days to appeal the decision to enter the site on the Vacant Site

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can the Council provide***

***an update after my motion to service Glasgow Park and Flanker Court with a bus service was***

***unanimously supported at a Metropolitan meeting. Can you advise if the Council has contacted***

***the NTA and Bus Eireann with a view to get the service up and running.***

**REPLY**: Currently the 303-bus route services Roxboro Road, Carew Park and then on to the

Kilmallock Road. At the moment this service turns left on the Kilmallock Road. This arrangement

will remain in place until a turning facility is implemented further out the R512 Kilmallock Road.

The current service to the Georgian Village, which travels along the Childers Road and is only four

services per day, will be reviewed by the NTA and Bus Eireann once the turning facility is

implemented on the R512 Kilmallock Road.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can the Council explain***

***why a speed survey is being redone on St. Patricks Road when the residents submitted a***

***petition and a speed survey was done in 2020 to establish that a speed ramp was needed. Why***

***has this ramp not been installed to date.***

Cllr Slattery confirmed that this Question was withdrawn.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that an update is provided***

***as to the reason for the delay in advertising the Part 8 in relation to the graveyard boundary***

***wall for Mount St. Oliver Cemetery, and that the design of the boundary wall be circulated to***

***the Elected Members as soon as possible and that the Part 8 be progressed as a matter of***

***urgency.***

**REPLY**: Design work and internal consultation is progressing on the project to construct a new

boundary wall and associated landscaping at Mount Saint Oliver Cemetery. The extent of the wall

has been confirmed at c. 268 metres with a height of c 3.1 metres, which varies with the

topography of the site. The design of the wall was circulated to Elected Members on the 18th

June 2021 for information. The setting out of the wall is being finalised taking account of the

Limerick City Bus Priority Measures proposed for the Kilmallock Road included in the Draft

Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS). Preparation of an Appropriate

Assessment Screening Report and Environmental Impact Assessment Screening Report are

underway and due to be completed on 25th June 2021. The Part 8 Submission will follow

completion of the planning documentation and internal consultation.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council has secured***

***Government funding, or a commitment of Government funding, and if there are commitments***

***existing for funding from the University of Limerick, Clare County Council or Waterways Ireland***---
9

***to contribute to the development of the Black Bridge in Plassey and if any discussions have been***

***had within the local Authority, and / or with any other bodies regarding the development.***

**REPLY**: The Black Bridge forms a logical crossing of the Shannon connecting existing/proposed

Greenways on the Limerick and Clare sides of the river. Waterways Ireland will be leading the

progression of the Greenway in County Clare and are shortly to set up and head a steering group

consisting of representatives from Limerick City and County Council, Clare County Council, the

Electricity Supply Board. Clearly, the securing of funding for the appropriate Shannon crossing

point will be an important goal of this body.

Limerick City and County Council has raised with the National Transport Authority the potential of

the Black Bridge serving as a logical Shannon Crossing point for linking Active Travel Modes/Green

Routes across the river and will strive to include this connection as an inclusion in the draft

Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy. Inclusion in LSMATS is critical to securing

funding to deliver an appropriate river crossing point and Limerick City and County Council will

seek to secure the Black Bridge as the appropriate location.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many applicants***

***approved for a 4 bed property, who have been on the housing waiting list for more than ten***

***years, have never been offered a property to-date, and, if any, a breakdown per each Electoral***

***Area.***

**REPLY**:

**13.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***"BELONGING TO LIMERICK-Limerick City and County Integration Plan 2018-22" implementation***

***and if an evaluation of this plan will be taking place.***

**REPLY**: The Limerick Integration Working Group (IWG) is an Interagency Group that oversees the

implementation of the strategy. The membership include key stakeholders from the public and

other sectors. Following the adoption of the strategy by the Council the IWG established five

thematic working groups to progress the implementation of the strategy. The thematic groups

are; 1) Language, education and employment, 2) Information, advice and direct support services,

3) Equality of access to public services, 4) Cultural awareness and anti-racism and 5) Active

Community Participation.

The implementation approach is to focus on specific actions under the above themes but during

the COVID 19 pandemic and the emerging needs that arose, particular attention was given to

those considered high risk such as persons in direct provision, undocumented persons and those

considered highly vulnerable.---
10

The IWG meets on a quarterly basis and monitors the progress of the working groups and it is

planned to complete an evaluation of the strategy in Q3/Q4 in 2022, which will also inform the

development of the next strategy.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update regarding***

***planning compliance by the operator of Ballyneety Quarry.***

**REPLY**: Following inspection by Planning Enforcement, Warning Letters were issued to the owners

of the site. A response has been received from the owners dated 31st May 2021. Planning

Enforcement is currently assessing this response with a view to determining how to progress this

case.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**15.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan (to be referred to the Economic**

**Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick***

***Metropolitan District Council require that Limerick City and County Council make the inclusion***

***of swift bird nesting boxes on suitable sites, a planning condition as part of the planning***

***application process.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Economic Development, Enterprise and

Planning Strategic Policy Committee.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District:***

***(a)***

***address mitigation measures where residents in existing residential developments living near***

***roads are exposed to existing high noise levels from transportation;***

***(b)***

***calls on the DHPLG and the Department of Transport to develop national policy and***

***guidance on the approach to addressing exposure to transportation noise, that will***

***identify what an excessive noise level is and what acceptable road noise levels are for***

***communities both in existing residential developments near roads with a view to establishing***

***eligibility for mitigation measures, and when considering planning for new residential***

***developments.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Hartigan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas referred to the lack of national guidelines for traffic

noise levels and highlighted the importance of having national guidelines in place to protect the

health and wellbeing of communities, especially those communities located close to major road

networks and infrastructure.---

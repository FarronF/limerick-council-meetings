DRAFT LIMERICK DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2022-2028:

and (b) Report from the Chief Executive dated 26th April, 2021,together with Draft Limerick

Development Plan 2022-2028.

The Mayor welcomed those present to the further Adjourned Special Meeting, which was being

held online, to continue discussion on the Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028. He

confirmed that the required three days’ notice of this second Adjourned Meeting was not

possible in the time available since the first Adjourned Meeting on the 16th June and confirmed

that on the proposal of Councillor J. Sheahan, seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon that Standing

Orders had been suspended to allow for this.

The Mayor explained that the purpose of the meeting was to consider proposals made by some

Members regarding amendments to the Rural Settlement Strategy Map proposed.
---
1. **Changes proposed to Chapter 3**

Cllr J. Sheahan proposed the following amendment:

Amend the rural settlement strategy map and the first paragraph on page 3-12: Remove

wording: “or Key town”

“The NPF and RSES make a distinction between areas under urban influence i.e. those

within the commuter catchment of cities and large towns and centres of employment,

(which includes Electoral Divisions where at least 15% of their workforce commute to a City

**or Key town)** and rural areas outside these catchments, where a more flexible approach to

rural housing will apply”.

Cllr J. Sheahan outlined his reason for the amendment stating that Section 5.3 in the National

Planning Framework states that it is “important to differentiate, on the one hand, between

rural areas located within the commuter catchment of the five cities and our largest towns and

centres of employment and on the other hand rural areas located outside these catchments”.

The Draft Plan that issued to the Elected Members in April 2021 considered the commuting

catchment to Limerick City and Newcastle West.

“Large towns and centres of employment” are defined in Appendix 4 of the National Planning

Framework, under References, as towns with a population of more than 10,000 people or more

than 2,500 jobs. In Appendix 2 of the NPF the population for Newcastle West in 2016 is stated

as 6,619 and the total jobs is 2,413.

As both population and jobs in Newcastle West is below the threshold set out in the NPF and

the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy for the Southern Region, the rural settlement

strategy map should be based on the criteria of 15% of the workforce employed in Limerick City

only and should exclude Newcastle West.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr J. Sheahan, seconded by Cllr Galvin.

Members raised queries in relation to the inclusion of some other Electoral Divisions and the

Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning confirmed that a number of Electoral

Divisions/Areas that were raised in the Adjourned Council meeting on the 16/06/2021 were

reviewed and considered.

She confirmed it is not proposed to change the Electoral Divisions, which exceed the 15% of

commuters commuting to Limerick City, as set out in the National Planning Framework. She

outlined the need to be consistent in terms of how the Council determines the rural settlement

strategy map, and that if the Council is using the 15% commuters to Limerick City, you cannot

include other EDs without justification.
---
The Mayor thanked the Members and staff for their engagement and consideration of the Draft

Development Plan and their input in the many Workshops regarding same. The Chief Executive

also thanked the Members and staff, and in particular the Strategic & Forward Planning staff,

for their work on the Plan which would be the first plan for Limerick City and County when

finally adopted.

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning confirmed that the Draft Plan is the first

consolidated Draft Plan prepared for Limerick City and County and will replace both the

Limerick City Development Plan 2010 – 2016 (as extended) and the Limerick County

Development Plan 2010 – 2016 (as extended), when adopted.

She also confirmed that the Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 would now go on

display for public consultation during the period 26th June 2021 to 6th September 2021. She also

outlined details of the various briefings and public consultation tools that would be available to

the public to hopefully ensure widespread engagement with the plan during the public

consultation process.

Proposed by Councillor J. Sheahan,

Seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon,

And Resolved:

“That pursuant to Section 12(1)(b) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended) that

Limerick City and County Council being the Planning Authority for Limerick, has prepared a Draft

Development Plan for the administrative area of Limerick which will now go on public display for

the period 26th June 2021 to 6th September 2021 ”

This concluded the Meeting.

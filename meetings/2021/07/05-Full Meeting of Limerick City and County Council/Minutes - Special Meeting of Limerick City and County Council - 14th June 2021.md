DRAFT LIMERICK DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2022-2028:

Report from the A/Director, Economic Development, dated 9th June, 2021, circulated; Report

from the Chief Executive dated 26th April, 2021, together with Draft Limerick Development Plan

2022-2028, already circulated.

The Mayor stated that the Special Meeting had been convened to consider the Draft Limerick

Development Plan 2022-2028 under Section 11(5) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as

amended). He stated that ‘Where the Draft Plan has been considered, it shall be deemed to be

the Draft Development Plan unless, by resolution, the Elected Members amend it.’

He referred to the numerous Briefings on various aspects of the plan which had been organised

for the Members in the previous weeks and he thanked the Members and Management for their

engagement with same. He also, on behalf of all the Members, thanked the staff in Strategic &
---
Forward Planning for their professionalism and hard work in the preparation of the plan and for

being readily available to clarify and assist with any issues arising in relation to the Plan.

The Chief Executive referred to the fact that seven years ago in June 2014, Limerick City Council

and Limerick County Council came together to form a new local authority, Limerick City and

County Council. This was a hugely important step in terms of the rebirth of Limerick as the city

and county now had one united voice to drive forward together.

The word ‘renaissance’ was used at that time to describe what would unfold when the vision

for an emerging and dynamic new Limerick was outlined with the Limerick 2030 Economic and

Spatial Plan. It was a word loaded with expectation but as the seven years have shown since, it

is more than being fulfilled.

The objective was to make Limerick a more attractive destination for those who live here,

businesses to locate here, potential residents and visitors. Investment’s in Limerick over that

time have reached €2.73 billion, and over 19,000 jobs have been created. Many people have

also moved to Limerick to raise their families and new homes have been built to accommodate

the increasing population.

Now Limerick - already Ireland’s third-largest city - is poised to grow even larger in the coming

decades. By 2040, the population of Limerick is expected to increase substantially. Currently,

500,000 people live within an hour’s drive of the city, and over 100 nationalities are

represented in Limerick’s population.

While much progress has been made since amalgamation, we have arrived at a very important

stage in our evolution as a young local authority. We are now preparing to issue our first new

draft Development Plan for our new local authority out to the public for public consultation at

the end of this month.

He confirmed that the Limerick Development Plan will be the first plan which will cover

Limerick city and county, and will be the single most important document in shaping the future

of Limerick. Its preparation is one of the most important functions of the Council, acting as a

blueprint for the development of Limerick from a physical, economic, social and environmental

viewpoint over its lifetime.

The formal process of making this Development Plan commenced in August 2020 with the

publication of the issues paper. Over the last 10 months, many meetings and workshops have

taken place on the preparation of the draft plan.

He thanked the Elected Members of Limerick City and County Council, for the enthusiastic way

they have engaged with Forward Planning staff to inform, develop and shape this historic new

plan. This engagement has been more difficult than normal due to Covid, but the Elected

Members have adopted to the new normal of online meetings to work positively for the people

of Limerick.
---
This Development Plan comes at a challenging time for Limerick as we try to re-build our

society and our local economy due to Covid 19 and Brexit. However, it is also a fantastic

opportunity to shape our inclusive future.

This Development Plan will set out a framework to guide the future development of Limerick

with a huge focus on the people who live here, the places we call home, the places we work

and how we interact and move between these places while protecting our environment.

This new Development Plan will set the strategy to co-ordinate and prioritise areas of

population growth as Limerick moves towards growing our city and county and the importance

of this new Development Plan cannot be over emphasised. As we plan for great places to live,

with well-designed homes, improved public transport, high quality public realm and green

spaces, new infrastructure and jobs, we will enhance the quality of life for the existing and

future generations of the people who live here.

The Chief Executive stated that he looked forward to engaging with the Elected Members to

complete the Draft Plan and over the next 12 months, to refine the plan following public

consultation and work towards adopting the plan in May 2022.

The A/Director, Economic Development referred to a query from the Elected Members

regarding proposed legislation to possibly suspend the Development Plan review process due to

Covid 19. He explained that the position is that the Government made a decision last week to

progress legislation to put a process in place to enable local authorities to extend their County

Development Plan review period, should that be considered necessary as a result of disruption

associated with Covid and where it may not be possible to meet statutory requirements within

the 'normal' two-year development plan review period.

This is now at an advanced stage of drafting and is subject to the Oireachtas legislative process,

with the intention of enactment prior to the summer recess in July 2021. However, he

confirmed that there is no provision for a local planning authority to immediately extend or

suspend a Development Plan review process that is currently underway.

It remains the case that there is generally a two year period within which to complete the

process (with plan reviews that were under way during all or part of an 8-week 'suspension'

period from 29 March 2020 as a result of Covid, subject to up to a further 8 weeks). Cllr

J.Sheahan requested that the local authority commence works to review the environmental

implications if the existing plans were to be extended at a later stage.

On enactment of this proposed legislation, which is subject to the legislative process, an

extension of a Development Plan review period may be considered by a planning authority, but

must be subject to statutory environmental assessments, to address any environmental

impacts of extending the current Development Plan for the intended period of extension,

beyond the 'normal' two years.
---
He confirmed that it is only when a planning authority can be satisfied that environmental

assessments are not required or can be screened out, or are required and have been completed

and any environmental impacts can be addressed/mitigated, that a final decision to extend the

Development Plan period may be made. This will effectively require an initial decision

regarding a planning authority's intention to extend the review period, which, subject to

environmental assessment processes, may then result in a final decision to do so.

Subject to the completion of all necessary environmental assessments as considered necessary

and where there are no major issues arising, the extended time period may then be applied to

the remaining duration of the process.

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning outlined the role of the Elected Members at

this stage of the Development Plan preparation process, which was to consider the Draft Plan

as presented by the Chief Executive, in accordance with the Planning & Development Act 2000

(as amended). It shall then be deemed to be the Draft Development Plan, unless by resolution,

the Elected Members amend the plan at this Special Meeting.

She explained that the Executive are making a number of non-material amendments to the

draft plan, such as removal of duplications, typographical errors and relocation of maps within

the document and these minor amendments did not require a resolution by the Members.

She confirmed that the Draft Plan would then go on public display from the 26th June, 2021 to

the 6th September, 2021 during which stage submissions can be made on it. She also confirmed

the likely timeline after the Plan went on public display:

 Chief Executives report prepared on submissions received and issued to the Elected

Members in November 2021;

 The Elected Members will consider the Chief Executives Report and make the Plan or

propose amendments at the Council Meeting in January 2022;

 Public consultation on the amendments to the Draft Plan in March 2022 (4 weeks);

 Chief Executives report prepared on submissions received on amendments and issued

to Elected Members in April 2022;

 Elected Members consider report and make the Development Plan in May 2022.

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning also outlined the requirement under the

Planning & Development Act 2000 (as amended) that obliges Elected Members and officials to

act in the long term common good, and that in making the Development Plan that the

Members are restricted to considering the proper planning and sustainable development of the

area and be mindful of statutory obligations and relevant policies of the Government or any

Minister. The Plan must also be consistent with the national and regional development

objectives in the NPF and RFES, and that proposed changes need to be precise and reasons

must be provided for making all proposed amendments.
---
**1.Amendments to the Draft Retail Strategy**

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning explained that following discussion at the

briefing meetings with the Elected Members on the Draft Retail Strategy, that a number of

amendments were proposed to this document as follows:

 Amend Section 6 in relation to ‘future pipeline supply’ as follows:

(a) In Section 6.14, remove the floor area associated with planning reference 20311, which

refers to a convenience unit in Shannon with a floor area of 1,837 sqm. This is to be

removed as planning permission was recently refused for this development and it is

therefore not appropriate that it is included in pipeline figures. Tables 6.20, 6.21 and 6.22

to be amended to reflect the above, with 1837sqm distributed across the metro area.

(b) Amendments to the following objectives in order to ensure clarity in terms of future

interpretation and to avoid duplication:

Omit text from Objective LCC15: The Council shall require that applications for new

supermarkets on Local Centre sites shall be accompanied by a Retail Impact Assessment.

Only new food stores that provide for sustainable upgrade of neighbourhood centres, that

are not reliant on car-based customers and integrate with mixed-use development will be

permitted.

Amend Objective MASP01: Convenience Retail Floor Space. It is an objective of the

Council to ensure emphasis remains to attract high quality convenience retail to the city

centre. However, there is a demand for new convenience floor space within established

residential areas and within to neighbourhood areas with growing residential

communities and regeneration sites.

Reason:In the interest of clarity.

The amendments were proposed by Cllr O’Hanlon, seconded by Cllr J. Sheahan.

**2.Amendments to the Zoning Matrix**

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning explained that there was a need to

amend the zoning matrix, as there was a number of typographical errors as follows:

-

Under Enterprise and Employment zoning, change Public House to ‘generally not

permitted’ rather than ‘open for consideration’.
---
-

Under Agricultural zoning, change the Boarding Kennels Footnote to “No.1 Ancillary

to Primary Use” rather than “No. 2 Except for Local/Neighbourhood Centers in Tier

4 Settlements”

-

Under Open Space zoning, remove the Conference Centre Footnote “No. 5 Except

Thomond Park”

-

Under Agricultural zoning, change the Garden Centre Footnote to “No.1 Ancillary to

Primary Use” rather than “No. 2 Except for Local/Neighbourhood Centers in Tier 4

Settlements”

-

Under Local/Neighbourhood Centre zoning, change Vehicles Sales Outlet Footnote

to “No. 10 Except in Settlements” rather than “No. 1111 Except in Settlements”.

The amendments were proposed by Cllr O’Hanlon, seconded by Cllr J. Sheahan.

**3.Include Additional Objective in Section (Broadband)**

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning outlined the inclusion of additional

objectives/text in Objective IN 04, Chapter 7 Infrastructure under Section 7.4.2

Telecommunication Support Structures, Antennae and Domestic Satellite Dishes and that the

reason for this change is to provide for the most up to date policy as follows:

Objective IN O4 :  Insertion of a) and b) highlighted below.

Objective IN O4 - Telecommunication Support - It is an objective of the Council to:

a) Promote shared telecommunications infrastructure in all new developments to

facilitate multiple network providers. Shared infrastructure should be made

available to all broadband service providers on a non-exclusive basis to both

suppliers and users of the new infrastructure.

b) Work closely with the telecommunications industry during the development and

deployment phase of telecommunications infrastructure to carefully manage

Limerick’s road networks and minimise future road infrastructure works.

The amendments were proposed by Cllr O’Hanlon, seconded by Cllr J. Sheahan.
---
**4.Bruree**

Cllr Donegan proposed the following amendment:

Relocation of zoning in Bruree to take into account existing grant of permission at The

Paddocks, Bruree.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr Donegan, seconded by Cllr E. Ryan.

**5.Limerick 2030 Plan**

The Mayor, Cllr M. Collins indicated that a review and update of the Limerick 2030 Plan is

currently ongoing and is expected to be completed next week and it should be placed on public

display with the Draft Plan to facilitate public consultation on the review of the Limerick 2030

Plan.

Proposed by Cllr M. Collins, seconded by Cllr O’Hanlon.

**6.Rural Housing Policy.**

The Senior Planner, Strategic and Forward Planning outlined the proposed amendments to the

Rural Housing Policy, following discussions at the briefing meetings with the Elected Members.

She confirmed that the change proposed is in compliance with the NPF, RSES for the southern

region and the 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines.

Amendment as follows:

**Rural housing policy -** Replace text on page 3-2 with the following:

Limerick can be divided into two broad categories, in terms of defining the Rural

Settlement Strategy as follows:

Rural Housing Category 1 - Areas under Strong Urban Influence

-

Rural Housing Category 2 – Rural Areas Elsewhere

Objective SS O17 – Areas under Strong urban influence
---
It is an objective of the Council to consider a single dwelling for the permanent occupation

of an applicant, in the area under Strong Urban Influence, subject to demonstrating

compliance with ONE of the criteria below:

1. Persons with a demonstrable economic need to live in the particular local rural area;

Persons who have never owned a house in the rural area and are employed in rural-based

activity such as farming/bloodstock, horticulture or other rural-based activity, in the area

in which they wish to build or whose employment is intrinsically linked to the rural area

in which they wish to build, or other persons who by the nature of their work have

a functional need to reside permanently in the rural area close to their place of work

(within 10km). (Minimum farm size shall be 12 hectares for farming or bloodstock).

The applicant must demonstrate that they have been actively engaged in

farming/bloodstock/horticulture or other rural activity, at the proposed location for a

continuous period of not less than 5 years, prior to making the application. In the event

of newly acquired land, demonstrate that the proposed activity would be of a viable

commercial scale, and a detailed 5-year business plan will be required to demonstrate

this.

2. Persons with a demonstrable social need to live a particular local rural area;

Persons who have never owned a house in the rural area and who wish to build their first

home on a site that is within 10km of where they have lived for a substantial period of

their lives in the local rural area (Minimum 10 years). The local rural area is defined as the

area outside all settlements identified in Level’s 1 – 4 of the Settlement Hierarchy.

3. Persons with a demonstrable local exceptional need to live in a particular local rural

area, examples include:

a. Returning emigrants who have never owned a house in the rural area,

in which they lived for a substantial period of their lives (Minimum 10

years), then moved away or abroad and who now wish to return to

reside in the local rural area (within 10km of where they lived for a

substantial period of their lives). The local rural area is defined as the

area outside all settlements identified in Level’s 1 – 4 of the

Settlement Hierarchy.

b. A person who has lived a substantial period of their lives in the local

rural area, (at least 10 years), that previously owned a home and is no
---
longer in possession of that home due to the home having been

disposed of following legal separation/divorce/repossession and can

demonstrate a social or economic need for a new home in the rural

area.

Objective SS O18 – Rural Areas Elsewhere

It is an objective of the Council that to help stem the decline and strengthen Rural Areas

Elsewhere, in general demand for permanent residential development should be

accommodated, subject to meeting normal planning and environmental criteria.

In all cases the consideration of individual sites, for rural housing will be subject to normal

siting and design considerations, which will include, but not necessarily be limited to the

following:

 Any proposed vehicular access would not endanger public safety by giving rise to a

traffic hazard,

 That any proposed on-site waste water disposal system is designed, located and

maintained in a way which protects water quality,

 That the siting and design of new dwellings takes account of and integrates

appropriately with its physical surroundings and other aspects of the natural and

cultural heritage and,

 That the proposed site otherwise accords with the objectives of the Draft

Development Plan in general.

 The Planning Authority shall have regard to the viability of smaller towns and rural

settlements in the implementation of the rural housing policy.

 Climate action measures shall be submitted as part of any proposed application, to

support a transition to a low carbon economy.

Cllr. John Sheahan proposed an additional amendment to the last line of Point 2 relating to

demonstrable social need to read as follows: “The local rural area is defined as the area outside

all settlements identified in Level’s 1 – 4 of the Settlement Hierarchy, excluding level 4 settlements

where there is no capacity in the treatment plant.

The amendments were proposed by Cllr J. Sheahan, seconded by Cllr Galvin.
---
**7.Change to Volume 2-Hospital**

Cllr Mitchell proposed the following amendment:

Change the zoning of lands identified as New Residential in Hospital to Existing Residential and

to zone additional lands.

Cllr Mitchell outlined his reason for the proposed amendment, stating that works have

commenced and are advancing at pace on the lands which are identified as New Residential and

these lands should now be considered Existing Residential. The zoning of additional lands is to

ensure that there is sufficient lands to cater for the growth of Hospital, in line with the Core

Strategy, projected growth over the lifetime of the Draft Development Plan, subject to the much-

needed upgrade of infrastructure in the village.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr Mitchell, seconded by Cllr Donegan.

**8.Change to Chapter 2-Kilmallock**

Cllr Donegan proposed the following amendment:

Re-designation of Kilmallock as a Key Town on Level 2 of the Settlement Hierarchy.

Cllr Donegan outlined his reason for the proposed amendment, stating that Kilmallock is currently

a Tier 2 settlement as determined by the Limerick County Development Plan 2010 – 2016 (as

extended). It is the largest town in southeast Limerick and is a key market and service provider

for a large catchment extending into the rural hinterland, providing a large number of services for

the inhabitants. The town is also an important tourism hub for south and east Limerick and has

retained much of its historical features.

The town has consistently grown from 1,231 in 1996 to 1,668 in 2016 – growth of 35% and there

has been extensive development of the town in the last ten years. Kilmallock has benefitted from

its current location in the settlement hierarchy, in terms of seeking and securing funding for the

town and the wider area. The retention of Kilmallock as a key town is critical for securing

investment and delivery of growth for the town and the wider region.

The level of public infrastructure development and investment in Kilmallock over the past decade

has been made based on a national, regional and local policy that identified Kilmallock as a key

growth centre for Limerick. He stated that it made no sense, therefore, from a public policy

perspective or a value for money perspective, to now reduce the importance of Kilmallock and

limit the growth of the town to well within its immediate development capacity, particularly at a

time when Ireland needs housing and development to provide for a rising population.
---
The amendment was proposed by Cllr Donegan, seconded by Cllr Carey.

**9.Change to Chapter 4-Shopfront Design Guidelines**

Cllr O’Sullivan proposed the following amendment:

The inclusion of a new objective in Chapter 4 - Section 4.6.12, as follows:

It is an objective of the Council to prepare Shopfront Design Guidelines, within the lifetime of the

Development Plan, and ensure implementation of these guidelines on completion.

Cllr O’Sullivan outlined the reason for the proposed amendment, which was to ensure a high

quality design and coherence in the development of shopfronts throughout Limerick.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr O’Sullivan, seconded by Cllr McSweeney.

**10.Change to Chapter 4-Nightime Economy**

Cllrs O’Donovan & O’Sullivan proposed the following amendment:

The inclusion of a new Section to be included in Chapter 4 after Section 4.6, called Night time

economy. :

The Council recognise the importance of the night time economy throughout Limerick, which is

an important form of economic activity that occurs after 5pm and includes dining, nightlife, arts,

music, theatre, entertainment, festivals, events, activities and tourist attractions that are open at

night.

It is an objective to support the development of night time economy throughout Limerick and to

prepare a night time strategy and ensure the implementation of this strategy on completion.

Cllr O’Sullivan outlined the reason for the proposed amendment, which is to support and

enhance the night time economy throughout Limerick.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr O’Sullivan, seconded by Cllr O’Donovan.
---
**11.Change to Chapter 4-Data Centres**

Cllr O’Donovan proposed the following amendment:

An amendment to Objective ECON O23 Data Centres to include the following:

Promote co-location of data centres with renewable energy sources at appropriate locations

subject to proper planning and sustainable development considerations.

Cllr O’Donovan outlined the reason for the proposed amendment, which is to ensure that Data

Centres, as significant consumers of energy are located close to renewable energy sources.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr O’Donovan, seconded by Cllr Benson.

**12.Change to Volume 2-Tournafulla**

Cllr M. Collins proposed the following amendment:

Amendment to the settlement boundary for the village of Tournafulla to reflect the actual

village core, that exists on the ground and to concentrate development within the village core.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr M. Collins, seconded by Cllr Foley.

**13.Change to Volume 2, Chapter 2 and 3-Ballybrown**

Cllr McSweeney proposed the following amendment:

The inclusion of Ballybrown as a Level 6 settlement, in the Settlement Hierarchy and in Volume

2 of the Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022 – 2028

Cllr McSweeney outlined the reason for the proposed amendment, which is that Ballybrown is

situated eight kilometres west of Limerick City off the N69. Ballybrown has approximately 11

dwellings. The settlement is served by a public water supply. However, there is no sewerage

scheme in the settlement. The settlement provides a range of services including a community

resource centre, a primary school, a local food store. Sports facilities including a soccer club and

a GAA Club, are shared with the adjoining village of Clarina.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr McSweeney, seconded by Cllr O’Sullivan.
---
**14.Changes to Volume 2** **–** **City and Environs Zoning Map and Chapter 3**

Cllr Daly proposed the following amendment:

To re zone lands shown on map from Enterprise and Employment to New Residential, local centre

and open Space / recreation and show indicative link to access Enterprise and Employment land.

Also proposed to add to Objective SS O5 in Section 3.3.3, Chapter 3 to ensure that the proposed

change in zoning does not contravene the Core Strategy:

The additional households permitted within each settlement shall not exceed the growth

identified in the Core Strategy Table in Chapter 3.

Cllr Daly outlined the reason for the proposed amendment, which is that the population of

Limerick is expected to grow significantly in accordance with the NPF. To facilitate this growth, it

is essential that there are adequate lands available for residential development within the City

and Environs. These lands are serviceable within the lifetime of the plan, adjacent to the

Technical University of the Shannon and will benefit the university by offering residential lands

within walking and cycling distance.

Some Elected Members opposed the proposed rezoning amendment and stressed the

importance of this land being zoned for Enterprise and Employment as there is a need to create

jobs in the Moyross/North side area of the city. Following a query from Members, the Senior

Planner, Strategic & Forward Planning confirmed that the land involved in the proposed

rezoning comprised 14.5ha and that the remaining land comprised 37.6ha. The Chief Executive

also confirmed that there was enough zoned land elsewhere for Enterprise and Employment in

the area.

A vote then took place to determine whether the proposed rezoning amendment should be

inclued:

**In favour of the proposed amendment:**

Councillors Butler, Carey, B. Collins, J. Collins, M. Collins, Daly, Donegan, Egan, Foley, Galvin,

Keary, Kiely, Kilcoyne, Leddin, Mitchell, Murphy, O’Brien, O’Dea, O’Donoghue, O’Hanlon,

O’Sullivan, Ruddle, E. Ryan, Scanlon, Secas, J. Sheahan, K. Sheahan, M. Sheahan, Slattery,

Talukder, Teefy.

(31)

**Against the proposed amendment:**

Benson, Costelloe, Hartigan, Novak Uí Chonchúir, O’Donovan, C. Sheehan.

**15.Change to City and Environs Zoning Map and Tiered Approach to Zoning**

Cllr Leddin proposed the following amendment:

Proposed a change to zoning of the site on Dock Road from Agricultural to Enterprise and

Employment.

Cllr Leddin outlined the reason for the proposed amendment, which is that Roches Feeds

Business currently operates on the Dock Road. They purchased 4.6 hectares of industrial zoned

land in 2017, to facilitate the extension of their business and the construction of new

warehousing and grain drying facilities in Limerick City. The new facility is being developed to

advance the company’s Green Agenda and will use GM free raw materials to deliver a niche

product to the farming community. The provision of such a niche product requires a separate

production facility. He confirmed that the development will be accessed off the existing service

road providing access to the Wastewater Treatment Facility. Traffic volumes will be low (circa

20 HGV movements onto and from the site per day during a 12-hour period) and the safety,

capacity and efficiency of the N69 Dock Road and N18 /N69 Interchange will be maintained and

protected in accordance with the Spatial Planning & National Road Guidelines.

Additional employment will be created for 15 – 20 people when operational. A development

proposal is well advanced for the site and pre planning meetings were held with the planning

authority. However, to date Brexit and Covid 19 challenges have hindered progress on the site.

There is no other alternative site available in Limerick City. Although planning permission for the

facility was previously secured on land adjoining the existing Roches Feeds operation on the Dock

Road in 2013 (P13/770158), ultimately that land could not be acquired. There is no land for

expansion within the current operational site as Roches Feeds over the years has lost land to the

construction of the Racecourse Road and roundabout and provision of land (wayleave) to

accommodate Limerick Main Drainage. Relocating the development to a potential alternative

site outside of Limerick City will result in greater traffic movements, commuting and dispersed

urban growth. Development on the site will also facilitate compact growth in line with the

requirements of the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the Regional & Economic Spatial

Strategy for the Southern Region (RSES). A Development Plan Flood justification test in line with

the section 28 Flood Guidelines was also submitted by Cllr Leddin.

The Members noted that this company was a long established and very good employer on the

Dock Road in Limerick, which gave excellent support to the farmers of Co. Limerick and beyond.
---
They noted the company’s intention to advance a Green Agenda and that they intend to use GM

free raw materials to deliver a niche product to the farming community.

The amendment was proposed by Cllr Leddin, seconded by Cllr O’Hanlon.

In view of time constraints and Meetings Guidelines relating to Covid 19, it was agreed to adjourn

the Meeting to Wednesday, 16th June, 2021, at 9am, in the Millennium Theatre, Limerick Institute

of Technology, Moylish, Limerick.

The Meetings Administrator advised that the required three days’ notice of the Adjourned

Meeting would not be possible in the time available, and on the proposal of Councillor J. Sheahan,

seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon Standing Orders were suspended to allow for this.

This concluded the Meeting.

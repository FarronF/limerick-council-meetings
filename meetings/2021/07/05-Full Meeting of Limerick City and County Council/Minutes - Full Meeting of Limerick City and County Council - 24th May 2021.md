Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**I will ask at the next Meeting of Limerick City and County Council for the Council to outline what**

**if any arrangements it has in place in relation to long term leasing from private developers in**

**relation to social housing and the cost of any such arrangements.**

**REPLY:**

Leasing arrangements are delivered under the Social Housing Current Expenditure

Programme (SHCEP). It provides for the leasing of suitable properties by Limerick

City and County Council for periods of between 5 to 25 years under the following

schemes: (a) Long Term Leasing; and (b) Repair and Lease.

An independent valuation of the market rental is sought for each supported property

and Limerick City and County Council agrees this market rent with the property

owner, which is then discounted by 15%/20%. If a property owner is availing of the

Repair and Lease Scheme, any loan advanced will be offset against the discounted

market rent agreed. Limerick City and County Council will agree with the property

owner on a case-by-case basis what the appropriate offset period will be. Monies

paid to property owners under leasing arrangements are recoupable from the

Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under the Social Housing

Current Expenditure Programme.

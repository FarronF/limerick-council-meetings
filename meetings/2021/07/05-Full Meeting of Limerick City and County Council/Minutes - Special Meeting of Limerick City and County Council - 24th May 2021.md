1.CLOSURE OF AER LINGUS CABIN CREW BASE AT SHANNON AIRPORT:

The Mayor said that it was an incredibly sad day for Limerick and the Mid-West when the

news was announced the previous week that Aer Lingus would permanently close its Shannon

base. He mentioned in particular the 126 staff and their families at Shannon Airport who

were now facing redundancy at the end of a long and very successful era for Aer Lingus at

Shannon.

While he understood that the aviation industry had been severely impacted by the COVID-19

pandemic, clarification was now needed from Aer Lingus about what this would mean for the

retention of services, particularly for international connectivity on key routes into Heathrow

and North America, and a timeline for when these were expected to resume.

He was aware that the business community was extremely concerned at reports that Aer

Lingus was considering moving some aircraft used to fly to Boston, New York and Heathrow,

from Shannon, to the UK. It was known how much transatlantic routes supported

multinational investment and tourism in the Region; but there was now a very real question

mark over the future of Aer Lingus transatlantic services from Shannon and this question

needed to be urgently answered.

The Government had made clear the importance of regional growth and the regional

economy and the extremely important role Shannon played in that. Stakeholders in the

Region, the Government and the Airport needed to come together to ensure that the best

possible sustainable solution for everyone was found.

He was calling on the Government to implement the recommendations of the Taskforce on

Aviation to assist the sector to recover from the COVID crisis and to introduce policies to

protect Shannon and other regional airports outside of Dublin.

The Mayor went on to say that since Shannon was separated from the Dublin Airport

Authority, it was the second fastest growing airport pre-COVID. It had grown its passenger

numbers by just over 300,000, while Cork grew by almost 250,000. Dublin, however, grew

passenger numbers by 13.8 million, winning 96% of all new passengers into Ireland. That was

not sustainable for airports outside of the capital and policy needed to be introduced to

ensure this market monopoly did not continue in recovery or other airports would struggle to

survive. A plan was urgently needed to ensure that Shannon Airport and the Mid-West were

ready for the recovery in global aviation.

The Mayor added that he supported the calls that any Government subsidies or support to

airlines would be contingent upon commitments from airlines to increase regional route

connectivity.

He was also calling for the fast-tracking of the appointment of a new Chairperson for the

Shannon Group as it had been without one now for nine months in the biggest crisis for

aviation ever in Ireland and this appointment needed to be in place as a matter of urgency.

The Members then spoke in turn and the following additional points were made by them in

the ensuing discussion:

 Effect on the aviation sector as a result of the global pandemic.

 Allocation of slots in Heathrow Airport.

 Investment required in order to compete with Dublin Airport.

 Competitive costs and ability to provide lower fares within the EU.

 Protection of jobs at Shannon Airport.

 Significance of Shannon Airport as a strategic asset and the need for balanced regional

development.

 Requirement for connectivity to major hubs from Shannon Airport.

 The urgent need for an Aviation Policy specifically for Shannon Airport.

 Ease of access to the Mid-West for FDI’s and for the hosting of the Ryder Cup.

 Deputation of Mayor, Chief Executive and relevant stakeholders to meet with the Minister

for Transport, Mr. Eamon Ryan, TD.

The Chief Executive acknowledged the comments made by the Mayor and Members and

stated that the Economic Development Directorate would pursue the issue regarding the slots

at Heathrow. He confirmed that a Deputation could be arranged as requested by the

Members.

The Mayor summarised the discussion, stating that there was unanimous support for the

Motion and that the Council would now write on the issue to An Taoiseach, Micheál Martin,

TD, and to the Minister for Transport, Mr. Eamon Ryan, TD, asking that the Minister would

meet with a Deputation comprising the Mayor, Chief Executive and relevant stakeholders to

discuss the closure of the Aer Lingus base at Shannon, the retention of the

Shannon/Heathrow slots, and the appointment of a Chair to the Shannon Group.

This concluded the Meeting.

extension of the existing Greenway from Rathkeale to Limerick and Rathkeale to

Askeaton and Foynes. The Director, Community, Tourism and Culture advised funding

has been allocated to extend the Rathkeale to Limerick Greenway project which he

hoped would progress in the near future. He also advised the route from Rathkeale to

Ballingrane and on to Askeaton would be done in stages, however, an issue had arisen

with the Limerick to Foynes road and this section of the Greenway would not be

included in the project at this stage. Members welcomed these plans.

gave a presentation to Members on the proposed plans to upgrade the Greenway at

Rathkeale. These upgrades would include providing a number of services such as

bike/electric bike hire and repair, electric car charging points, toilets, picnic area and an

information point for the public. Plans are included to enhance the existing goods shed

and platform, install benches with bike racks in the renovated car park and also include a

set down area for coaches together with upgrade of the existing car park to include new

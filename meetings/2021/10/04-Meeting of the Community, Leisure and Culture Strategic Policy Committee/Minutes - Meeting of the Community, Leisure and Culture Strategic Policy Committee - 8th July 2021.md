Item 3: To consider a notice of motion from Cllr Danie! Butler (Referred from the
Metropolitan District of Limerick meeting held on 17th May, 2021) “I will call on Limerick
Council to develop a recreation plan for Limerick City West to include a Municipal sports
facility such as basketball, a skate/bike Park and other sports”

Mayor D Butler was unable to attend the meeting and asked that the motion be considered
in his absence. The motion was presented to the committee for their consideration. S O’
Connor advised the members that Limerick City and County Council has commenced work on
a Sports & Recreation and Facilities Strategy, covering all municipal districts. The development
of this strategy has been delayed by Covid 19 restrictions.

The brief for the consultants includes examining all existing facilities for a full range of sports,
which includes basketball, muga/skatepark among others and the need for potential new
facilities. This notice of motion will be considered as part of the ongoing strategic study that
is being prepared. This strategy will come back to the SPC for approval at a future date

Item 4: Audit of Community & Cultural Facilities (Short Presentation & Discussion)

The members received a further detailed update on the Audit of Community & Cultural
Facilities. The Presentation outlined the background & objectives of the audit. The audit will
inform Limerick City & County Council's strategy on community and cultural facilities. It will
identify gaps in provision, demand, capacity to deliver and operational models. It was
proposed that a workshop will take place to further input into the preparation of the strategy
under the following headings,

1. The building (old / re-use, new build, shared)

2. Community development process & social inclusion

3. Managing activities & services — sustainable operation (governance, volunteer
strategy, activity / business plan etc.)

After the presentation the members were given the opportunity to ask questions, Cllr 0’
Hanlon expressed his concern in that he sees gaps in the system particularly in the
metropolitan area where they are no avenues for communities to get funding and asked
where funding could be accessed for community facilities?

Clir EO’ Donovan echoed Cllr K O’ Hanlon’s concerns with regards funding and stated that
Dooradoyle/Raheen are in need of a community centre but also acknowledged that there is
no funding available. Cllr EO’ Donovan also highlighted the LEDP as a good model that could
be used for future plans for community centres.

P Moles enquired if the presentation could be given to the PPN linkage groups? E
Humphreys stated that she would be delighted to present to the PPN at a later stage. He

also asked a question on behalf of M Conlon who was unable to attend the meeting with
regards the lack of community facilities in Limerick City West and the lack of LEADER funding
in this area, He asked what actions are being taken to fast track community facilities in this
area. E Humphreys outlined that the LEADER programme is currently in a transition period
and the shape of the new LEADER Programme Is unknown at this time. She also outlined
that the new LEADER programme may not have the same priority towards community
groups that may have been in earlier LEADER programmes.

E Humphreys agreed with regard to lack of funding currently available and acknowledged
that the scale of demand for these facilities requires significant funding. E Humphreys
outlined that the URDF, which is large scale funding for urban development, may be a
source of funding but this funding is for city centre development and community facilities
would need to be integrated with other types of development. E Humphreys also agreed
that the study showed the need for a community facility in the Garryowen area and
Dooradoyle/Raheen and that these should be a priority. E Humphreys also suggested that
one form of financing models that will need to be need to be considered is a combination of
public funding, philanthropic, and long term loan financing.

Item 5: Sports Partnership- Active Cities (Presentation)

The members received a presentation on Active Cities from Sports Partnership. The
presentation highlighted that the Active Cities framework suggests that activities should take
place across four key themes of:

* Active Systems

* Active Environments

* Active Societies

* Active People
Active Cities is a National Initiative with 8 sites including Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford
and Dublin x 4. A National Coordinator with 8 Local Active Cities Officers will be recruited and
€3.5 Million will be used from Dormant Accounts over 3 Years across the 8 sites.

The presentation also discussed the next steps for the initiative, which include the need to
convene an Active Cities Steering Committee to drive the initiative and the need to recruit an
Active Cities Officer for Limerick & National Active Cities Lead. Active Cities will not replace
LCCC responsibilities but will look for partnerships and synergies meeting.

After the presentation, the members were given the opportunity to ask questions.

P Moles enquired if there is a mechanism in place as to how groups/organisations can get
involved with the programme? P Macken outlined they want as many voices and
representations that can help them, initially a few essential organisations will be brought on
board, and then the programme will be opened up to other organisations and developing sub
committees.

J Butler stated that a lot of groups are moving out of the city to county Limerick and County
Clare with the lack of facilities/clubs based around the river. She asked if this is something
that will be addressed in the Active Cities programme.

P Macken outlined that Sports Partnership currently have a project in the city with Athlunkard
Boat Club, this club was selected because of its location and its membership. He outlined
that it is not always about the facilities but about people not utilising certain clubs due to
choice. He also stated that he is aware of issues with changing facilities and access and that it
is something that Sports Partnership are looking at when they discuss possible barriers to
sport. Clir KO’ Hanion also mentioned use of the river and the importance of getting the canal
revitalised and cleaned up.

Cllr A Talukder outlined that there is no cricket grounds in the metropolitan area and enquired
is there any plans for same? P Macken stated that sports partnership are working with Cricket
Ireland and Cricket Munster on the development of cricket in Limerick and that there is
ongoing work at looking at potential facilities for the area.

M Meaney asked what plans sports partnership have to make sports more accessible to
people with disabilities and how do they intend to reach out to this community?

P Macken outlined that Sports Partnership have a sports inclusion officer and part of their
role is to sit on the steering board and are involved in all Sports Partnership programmes. He
also stated that they have an inclusion club that promotes physical activity for young people
which takes place on Saturdays. Under Active Cities there will be an element of the allocation
that will be used to help people with disabilities to be more physically active.

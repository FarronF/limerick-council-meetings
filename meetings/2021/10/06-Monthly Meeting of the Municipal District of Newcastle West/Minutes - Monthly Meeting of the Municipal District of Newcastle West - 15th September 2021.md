11. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

1 will ask at the next Meeting what percentage of cyclists who visited/utilised our Green

REPLY: There are currently 8 counters at various locations along the Greenway

facility.

It is not possible to determine from these counters what percentage of cyclists
brought their own bicycles to the Greenway and therefore the information
sought is not available to the local authority.

Greenway. In replying, Director stated that as the process of completing due diligence on
the loan agreed by Elected Members took longer than anticipated, this has delayed start up.

guidelines that are in place, staff are still working from home on occasion. It was noted that
if someone is working from home, that they should be able to do the same work from home

28. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas (to be referred to the Community, Leisure
and Culture Strategic Policy Committee)

| will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and County
Council calls on the Community, Leisure and Culture SPC to timetable at its next meeting for a
strategic discussion the following issue:

- the sense of community and place of the residential community in estates near UL is being
fundamentally damaged by the Council's failure to protect these “10 minute walk neighbourhoods’
from the devastating effects of the ever expanding UL student intake. This along with the high
dependence of UL management on privately managed, houses of multiple occupancy (HMOs) to
accommodate the majority of their students, with many HMOs being inappropriately managed.
These issues, coupled with the student accommodation crisis and the antisocial behaviour of some
UL students, are damaging the residential community resulting thus in a trend of many residents
being forced out of their homes over the years.

| will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and County

| will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the possibility of litter
bin sponsorship be examined as 2 way to provide revenue for the provision of more bins in the city
and its environs and to support local businesses to be more visible on their respective streets / areas.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick Metropolitan***

***Council undertake a comprehensive survey of all properties located in our Georgian area to***

***determine ownership, occupancy and potential residential capacity subject to possible***

***redevelopment.***

**REPLY**: The Forward Planning Department have carried out land use surveys of the city centre.

The most recent of which was carried out in November, 2019. The survey identified use

and vacancy across floors in buildings. Separately, the Urban Innovation Department has

currently carried out a building condition survey of buildings in the Georgian core.

The Urban Innovation Department will liaise with the Forward Planning Department to

prepare an updated use and vacancy survey in the context of the identifying potential

residential units in the city centre.

The Council are actively working on encouraging and supporting the redevelopment of

historic buildings in the city centre through a number of programmes:

• The Urban Innovation Department (UID) manage the Living City Initiative – a tax

incentive scheme designed to support the refurbishment of historic (pre 1915)

properties. Since its relaunch in 2018 the UID have actively promoted the scheme

through the holding of events and seminars as well as the production of promotional

material and videos. Furthermore, the UID have liaised with auctioneers in the city to

promote the scheme as part of the sales pack for properties within the qualifying area.
---

• To support this process the UID operate a “one stop shop” advice clinics for property

owners and potential property owners that are attended by the Conservation Officer,

Fire Officer, Area Planner as well as relevant staff from the Urban Innovation

Department.

To date 48 applications have been received for residential development under the initiative.

Commercial developments are certified directly by the Revenue Commissioners.

• The Urban Innovation Department is also working on developing solutions to some of

the specific challenges faced by people redeveloping these buildings.

• Funding has been secured under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund to

redevelop 2 existing Council owned properties for residential use. The projects are at

preliminary design stage.

o The +City xChange EU Project is examining methods that enhance the energy

performance of historic buildings and potential financial mechanisms that could

support these works.

o In respect of fire safety, the Urban Innovation Department has secured funding from

Enterprise Ireland under the Small Business Innovation Research to develop

potential sensor based solutions to meet the requirements of the building

regulations.

In both of these projects the Urban Innovation Department are working directly with

property owners to develop solutions to these issues.

Other initiatives operated by the Council include:

• Conservation grants – The Planning Department through the Conservation Officer,

administer a number of conservation grant schemes on behalf of the Department of

Housing, Local Government and Heritage on an annual basis. These schemes are

advertised in the local press when the Department of Housing, Local Government and

Heritage advise the Council.

• Property Services in the Council, sits within the Community, Tourism and Culture

Directorate; they are responsible for operating the Derelict Sites Act and are actively

engaging with property owners to bring properties out of dereliction. The Department

are actively engaging with property owners to bring derelict properties back into use. A

number of properties have been compulsorily acquired under the provisions of the Act.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, how many unoccupied***

***houses owned by Limerick City and County Council are in Kennedy Park and when will they be***

***refurbished and allocated to a person on the housing list.***

**REPLY:**

There are 3 houses in Kennedy Park that require major refurbishment works in order

to

be allocated. At present, the estimated date of completion of the works required is

not

available.
---
6

House 1 – Opening up works and survey has been completed. Issue to Tender in February

2022, Commence Works April 2022, Completion October 2022.

House 2 and 3 - Opening up works and survey to be completed by 29th October. Issue to

Tender in March 2022, Commence Works April 2022, Completion November 2022.

All the above dates are subject to a receipt of approvals from DHLGH on foot of the Stage 3

and 4 submissions.

As all the properties are subject to a Stage 4 (post Tender) submission, if higher than

anticipated tender costs are received it may result in value engineering exercises being

required which will endeavour to reduce the overall cost. This may impact the delivery

timeline should it arise. Given the size of the works packages other issues may arise which

will be managed in the course of the project.

8.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, funding was allocated to***

***repair footpaths at Mount St. Lawrence Cemetery, was funding applied for to do the drainage***

***works that need to be done before footpaths are repaired and if not why has funding not been***

***applied for as drainage is an ongoing problem in this cemetery.***

**REPLY**: Capital works are required to be undertaken within Mount Saint Lawrence (Old)

Cemetery where currently the excess spoil from grave digging is temporarily stored,

adjacent to existing burial plots.

The works will involve the construction of a new more visually appropriate temporary

storage facility along with additional ancillary works i.e. surface water drainage and new

footpaths. The Council will prioritise the drainage aspect of the works. It is expected that

the works will be completed by the end of the year.

9.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can I have an update on***

***what plans the Council have for the green area located off Mulcair Drive, Annacotty.***

**REPLY**: Currently Housing Construction and maintenance are undertaking unit capacity checks.

On completion of these checks, a Capital Appraisal will be prepared for submission to the

DHLGH.

The proposed layout will be present to Elected Members for review prior to the

submission.

10.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, the reason why bollards***

***were removed along the cycle lane in Clonmacken and what safety surveys, if any, were carried***

***out prior to removal.***
---
7

**REPLY**: Segregation of shoulders and on road cycle lanes by means of kerbs and bollards to

delineate a cycling area is a recognised traffic calming/management practice and meets

safety requirements for such facilities, subject to onsite inspection to determine if any

localised safety concerns arise. This site, following pre installation inspection was deemed

suitable for this type of treatment.

The quantity of bollards installed at the time was at the upper limits of requirement.

Following review of the scheme it was determined that the kerbing installed was providing

adequate segregation and that the quantity of bollards could be reduced.

11.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, how many people are***

***currently on the housing waiting list in Limerick and if this figure includes those in receipt of HAP***

***and RAS. If not could a total figure be provided to include HAP and RAS.***

**REPLY**: The Housing Waiting List details are:

General approved applications 2,342

Transfer applications 335

HAP 2,479

RAS 735

12.

**Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, for an update on the***

***Council’s plan to introduce choice based letting which was supposed to be introduced over a year***

***ago.***

**REPLY**: Choice Based Letting (CBL) was piloted by Housing Support Services in 2019 on a number

of test properties. Below are a few observations on the scheme.

• The System is suited to a points based Housing Allocations Scheme.

• Newspaper advert was the most successful method to advertise the properties.

• Aligning to other LCCC back office IT infrastructure such as i-house and Agresso, the IT

infrastructure for a closed Choice Based Letting closed system would require an

investment.

• Properties have still been refused on the pilot CBL scheme. Penalties do apply in this

scenario.

• It is still resource intensive, which is not always visible.

CBL schemes are widely recognised as giving applicants greater choice of housing, reducing

void periods, reducing letting times, increasing tenancy sustainment and dramatically

reducing the difficulties associated with people refusing properties. It remains part of an

overall solution available to the Housing Allocations Team that may be utilised in different

parts of the County and different properties at any time.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to the site at***

***Sheep Street, how much progress has been made in the tendering process given the site has been***

***derelict a number of years.***

**REPLY:** The proposed development of the Sheep Street / Athlunkard Street site on King’s Island

which comprises the development of 8 no. new residential units has been tendered via

public procurement competition through the summer of 2021. Tenders which returned in

August 2021 are currently being assessed by the appointed Integrated Design Team

consultants and a Tender Report is expected to issue to the Local Authority through

September 2021. Upon receipt of the Tender Report and a recommendation from the

appointed technical consultants, the Local Authority intends to progress a Stage 4

application to the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government seeking approval

to award the construction contract.

14.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, following the discovery of***

***one of the ancient gated entrances in our city at Sunny**’**s Corner, have the Council liaised with the***

***various bodies to do the necessary works to expose this and preserve it for future generations.***

**REPLY:**

The chronology of the area of St Ann’s Court was that it lay immediately outside the

earlier city wall. In the last quarter of the 12th century St. Peter’s Cell, a nunnery, was

founded and at the turn of the 13th century the city defences were expanded to the east to

incorporate the precinct of same. By 1540 the nunnery buildings were ruinous and the area

had become fallow. By the 17th century the site had been built on and in the mid-19th

century at least half of the street was occupied by a leather tannery. The most recent

development was built in the 20th century.

Prior to acquisition, a preliminary archaeological assessment had flagged these issues. The

assessment recommended advance archaeological test trenching and a final design that

would bring the line of the wall back into the public realm, with the layout reflecting its

location. The most recent test trenching took place when the 20th century houses in St Ann’s

Court were demolished and the site was secured. The city wall extends SSE across the site

just below ground level. It is up to 2m wide and there is a height of at least 2m surviving

below ground level. At the rear of the footpath on the northern side of the road a faced

break in the wall was identified. This is likely to be the northern side of the opening for Little

Island Gate. No testing was carried out in the street. The outer face of the city wall was

exposed at Sonny’s Corner returning northward in line with the faced break. Further testing

at a later stage in the road will confirm the width of the opening for the gateway.

The recent archaeological test trenching was carried out under licence from the National

Monuments Service and copies of the final report will be submitted to that department.

City defences are considered to be of national importance and are therefore designated as

National Monuments (National Policy on Town Defences 2008) and protected under the

National Monuments (Amendments) Act 1930-2014. Due to the presence of the defences

all works on the site will require Ministerial Consent issued by the National Monuments

Service. It is the intention that any final design will address and incorporate the line of the

defences. In regard to exposing the gate which seems on the current evidence to actually
---
9

just be an opening in the wall defined by faced breaks, the original ground level is likely to

be at least 2m below the current ground level, so it may not be practical to expose but its

location will certainly be marked on the modern ground surface and it certainly will be

preserved for future generations.

There is tremendous potential in any future development to highlight and re-establish the

line of the wall and the location of the gate. As a member of the Irish Walled Towns Network

Limerick City is very aware of the importance of its city defences. Since their deliberate

destruction in the 18th century they have become fragmented. Redevelopment of this site

has the potential to re-unite over 80m of the early 13th century defences.

15.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an updated timeline on***

***the construction for the flood defence projects in Corbally and Kings Island.***

**REPLY:** Corbally is within the Limerick City and Environs FRS area. RPS Consulting Engineers are

now appointed on this project (April 2021) and are currently undertaking scoping and

preparation of survey and geotechnical tender packages. The current programme is

completion of Stage I (Option Assessment, Scheme Development and Design) by February,

2024, Stage II (Planning / Development Consent) to continue to May 2025 and Stage IV

(Construction) to run from September 2025 to February 2030, noting that there may be

several construction projects associated with the scheme that may be of shorter duration

within this window.

King’s Island FRS received Planning Approval in May 2021 and it is expected that

construction will commence Spring of 2022 with an estimated construction

programme of 18-24 months.

16.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***procurement and installation of additional CCTV cameras in Garryowen.***

**REPLY:**

There are currently no arrangements being made for the procurement or installation

of

any new CCTV cameras on behalf of Limerick City and County Council in the

Garryowen

area.

No additional installations are being considered at this time pending a review of policy. In

the event that additional infrastructure is to be considered then there are procedures

included in the CCTV Policy which would have to be followed.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor A. Talukder**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick about the reopening time***

***for the Limerick City Library.***

**REPLY**: An extensive adaption of Barrow House has been underway for the past number of

months. Some delays were experienced due to Covid restrictions during this period.
---
10

The challenge presented by the project was to adapt an existing building that was vacant

for approximately 10 years into a suitable modern public library premises. Inevitably, a lot

of complex issues arose.

The progress to date includes:

• A full re-design of two floors at Barrow House for Library purposes and a re-design of

the two upper floors for office purposes.

• A schedule of electrical, mechanical and ventilation works, to ensure that the new

Library space meets all functional, operational and safety standards, has been

completed.

• Re-location of the extensive City Library book stock, music collection, furniture and

equipment to Barrow House has been completed by the Library staff.

• We are currently completing the snagging stage for the building works in order to

finalise the completion of the building contract and to ensure that the Library can

open safely for public use.

When these necessary works have been completed and signed off, we will be able to

confirm a date for opening.

The estimate for opening to the public at the moment is late October 2021. We will

confirm an exact date closer to the time.

***I will move at the next Meeting that the Metropolitan District of Limerick Council call on the***

***Government and Garda Commissioner to provide additional garda resources for Limerick, and***

***specifically for the Castletroy area to tackle ongoing antisocial behaviour especially in the***

***housing estates around the UL.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Joint Policing Committee.

**24. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors S. Benson and J. Costelloe**

***We will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council, begin***

***the process of identifying funding options for the delivery of a much needed Community Centre***

***in Garryowen, whilst working alongside stakeholders to progress plans for delivery.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Community, Leisure and Culture Strategic Policy

Committee.

**25. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that driver feedback signs***

***are adapted to log the speeds detected in order to identify how serious the problem of speeding***

***is in particular areas and ascertain areas where speed reduction measures need to be***

***introduced.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Benson and agreed.

**REPLY**: Driver Feedback signs are used as a traffic calming device in Limerick City and County

Council and are not used to log traffic and speed data.

Limerick City and County Council adopted a Traffic Calming Policy in March 2018. This

Policy requires that a speed survey is undertaken in the area of interest for a period of 24

hours or more. The 85th percentile of the observed speed is then compared to the posted

speed limit in the area and a determination is made on whether traffic calming measures

are warranted.

These speed surveys are carried out using mobile equipment that is set up for a number of

days in the area of interest, primarily residential areas. Limerick Metropolitan District is

currently in the process of training additional staff members in the use of this mobile

equipment and intends to purchase another unit in the near future. This methodology is

considered the most appropriate means of identifying areas where speed reduction

measures are required.

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee for further discussion.

**26. Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

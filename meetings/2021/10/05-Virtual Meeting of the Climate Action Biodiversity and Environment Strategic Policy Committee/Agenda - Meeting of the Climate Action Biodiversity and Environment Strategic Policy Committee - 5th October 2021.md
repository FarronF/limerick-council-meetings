I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the

Council do a Feasibility Study on a large green area at the back of the Old Cork Road

that runs the length of 4 housing estates to determine if a community facility such as

a dog walking park can be established in the area.

**District of Limerick held on 21st** **June, 2021)**

I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we phase

out the use of glyphosate / roundup, that we seek clarification on the extent of use of

this chemical from any contractors who provide weed control / spraying to Limerick

City and County Council and that of our own staff members also, given the possible

health implications of its use on wildlife, domestic pets and people.---

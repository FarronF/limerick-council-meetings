Subsequent to the previous update in March 2021, the Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO),

to acquire the land and to extinguish the rights of way necessary for construction of the

proposed scheme, was confirmed by An Bord Pleanála on 10th May 2021. The statutory

Bord Pleanála’s confirmation of the CPO has passed, and no such application for judicial

review has been lodged in this case. Transport Infrastructure Ireland have granted

approval to Limerick City and County Council to commence the land acquisition stage

and accordingly, Limerick City and County Council served Notices to Treat on all owners,

lessees and occupiers for this scheme on 10th September 2021. Transport Infrastructure

Ireland have also granted approval to Limerick City and County Council to proceed to

the detailed design and tender phase (Phase 5 of the TII Project Management Guidelines)

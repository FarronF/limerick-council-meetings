**Irish Water**

As agreed at the commencement of the Meeting, Councillor Sheahan (J) stated that

he wished to raise an item in relation to Irish Water and, with the permission of the Mayor,

he proposed the following Motion:

**“I propose that Irish Water, as a** **utility company, be wound down and disbanded**

**forthwith and replaced by giving autonomy to Local Authorities to provide same by**

**Block Grants from the National Exchequer.”**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Sheahan (J) referred to the stress experienced by

owners of commercial properties, farmers and families who had faced water shortages. He

acknowledged the work of the local authority staff. However, he stated that the utility

company was under-funded and that the Service Level Agreement was not fit for purpose.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin and agreed.

Members expressed frustration with the service provided by Irish Water

acknowledging it was a nationwide problem at present.

The Deputy Chief Executive referred to the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 which

provided for the transfer of water service functions from Local Authorities to Irish Water. The

Act provided for the establishment of Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and

Local Authorities for the performance, on behalf of Irish Water, by the Local Authority of

certain functions. The Act allowed for such an Agreement to make provision for its

termination and its review and, indeed, specified a review not later than 2 years, and again

not later than 7 years, after the Agreement was made. Limerick City Council and Limerick

County Council both entered into Service Level Agreements (SLA) with Irish Water under the

Act with an effective date of 1st January, 2014, and a term of 12 years, unless terminated

sooner. The SLA provided for a review at the start of year 3 and year 8 (2022). Limerick City

and County Council had agreed to deliver public water supply and waste water treatment

services in accordance with the SLA and an Annual Service Plan in collaboration and with the

support of Irish Water. Changes to the SLA may be proposed by either Irish Water or Limerick

City and County Council and, where same occurred, were required to be agreed by the

National Management Process. The Deputy Chief Executive confirmed the Executive would

engage nationally in terms of the agreement.

The Deputy Chief Executive also encouraged Members to attend the quarterly

workshops between the Council and Irish Water.

Councillor Sheehan (C) asked for it to be noted in the Minutes that he was opposed to

the Motion.

QUESTIONS

Replies to the following Questions on the agenda were circulated to all Members prior

to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:---

8.

Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas

**I will ask at the next Meeting if the Council has gone to tender yet for grass cutting and tree**

**surgery works in the city and county.**

**REPLY:**

The tender for Tree Surgery for City and County has been advertised and

a framework of Contractors are expected to be in place early October.

The existing three-year grass cutting contract is nearing completion and

will cease at the end of October 2021. The Council will be advertising for

the new grass cutting contract in November of this year. The Council is

considering changing the requirements in the grass cutting contract as

an action to comply with its responsibilities in the All-Ireland Pollinator

Plan. The changes envisaged will look at the possibility of delaying grass

cutting at the start of the grass cutting season in appropriate areas and

will also look at the possibility of six weekly cuts in other areas. It is

important to note that these changes will be focussed only on open

green areas in housing estates and other public areas. In order to gauge

interest from the public on any proposed changes, the Council will

consult with the public during the month of October and will use the

feedback to inform the requirements for the grass cutting contract.

The Council has piloted a number of areas under the Bee Friendly

campaign in the last two years. This has served to raise awareness with

the general public and it is now considered opportune to make further

changes to its grass cutting regime in the City and County.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**I will ask at the next Meeting for the Council to outline what engagement it has had with**

**Waterways Ireland in relation to the maintenance of the Guinness Canal between Lock**

**Quay and the University of Limerick.**

**REPLY:**

The Council has met with Waterways Ireland in relation to the maintenance of

the Canal and discussed a number of maintenance measures for the Canal and

Lock Quay area. Waterways Ireland will undertake a programme of work that

will see the railings painted at Lock Quay, the brick paving replaced and all

rubbish in the canal removed. Waterways Ireland have advised that this

Quay to be removed. They will prepare a Screening Report and will seek the

appropriate environmental permissions to have the vegetation removed.

NOTICES OF MOTION

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council consider the**

**appointment of a Biodiversity Officer.**

In the absence of Councillor Novak and with her agreement, this Motion was proposed

by Councillor Hartigan who also proposed that it be amended to include the appointment of

a Tree Officer. He stated that a Tree Officer would coordinate the management of the tree

resource in a sustainable, cost-effective manner and help develop the Council’s Tree Strategy.

The amended Motion was seconded by Councillor Secas.

**REPLY:**

The Council, in accordance with the National Biodiversity Plan, is committed to

protecting and enhancing the biodiversity of the County. This is a key objective

of the Draft Development Plan and the Council has assigned a number of staff

to undertake a range of plans and projects, including supporting community

biodiversity initiatives.

Following the Council’s commitment to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan in 2019,

the Team has developed a number of pollinator-friendly projects, including the

creation of flower meadows across our parks in the last two years. The Council

is also currently preparing a Blue and Green Infrastructure Strategy for the City,

which will provide a framework for nature-based solutions, the development

of connecting ecological corridors, and the identification of projects to

enhance our biodiversity.

The Council will seek to continue to build on these plans and initiatives over

the coming years on a cross-departmental basis, having consideration to our

wider climate action obligations. The Council is currently reviewing the work

programme and resources and this will include consideration to a biodiversity

officer and/or assigned responsibilities within the overall environmental

strategy structure.

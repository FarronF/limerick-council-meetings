**Adoption of Minutes**

Prior to the adoption of the Minutes Councillor Teskey advised that an issue he had

raised at the September Meeting of the Municipal District had not been recorded in the

Minutes. He stated that an underpass was required for a farmer on the N21 due to

safety issues of crossing cattle on the road at Reens Pike. The Senior Executive Engineer

advised an underpass could be considered under the Part 8 process for the N21

Coolanoran Safety Scheme.

Councillor Teskey also referred to a proposal at the September Municipal District

Meeting requesting legal action be taken against Irish Water for the pollution in the

River Deel which he was not been allowed to raise at the Full Council Meeting and asked

for the matter to be forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

requesting this body now take legal action against Irish Water on the matter. The

Director, Housing advised Councillor Teskey a Local Authority cannot instruct another---

public body to carry out this request. Councillor Teskey then asked if the District could

write to the Environmental Protection Agency to ask if they could investigate the matter

taking into account that Irish Water are not providing a relevant treatment plant in

Askeaton.

Rathkeale held on 14th September, 2021.

Following the adoption of the Minutes Councillor Keary expressed disappointment,

following a conversation with The Director, Community, Tourism and Culture (Mr. G. Daly)

in relation to the Greenway, that they are not going to tender for facilities such as bike

hire, catering etc. Councillor Keary advised he would not support the Part 8 process if this

were the case. Councillor Teskey agreed the Local Authority should have advised

Members of this and that there should be more collaboration with local businesses.

The Director, National and Regional Shared Services circulated a report and proceeded to

the District to attend a future District Meeting to discuss the matter further. This was

seconded by Councillor O’Donoghue and agreed.

relation to the Environmental Protection Agency investigating Irish Water, if the District---

she had discussed the matter with Sean Coughlan, Deputy Chief Executive, who had

agreed to provide the monies required from the 2022 GMA allocation if Members had

exhausted their 2021 allocation. Councillor Teskey expressed his frustration at the

misinformation being relayed to the people of Pallaskenry that he and Councillor Keary

had refused to provide funding towards the project. He stated that he was fully

supportive of the project, however, felt the funding should be sought from Central

Government. Councillor Keary agreed with the sentiments of Councillor Teskey and also

suggested the required funding be sought from the same source as the Adare Fountain

project.

**QUESTION**

**5.**

**Question submitted by Councillor J.** **O’Donoghue**

**I will ask at the next meeting for an update on any new application for Town and**

**Village Renewal Scheme or any other works associated with the road, footpath and**

**signage in Fedamore village.**

These works will be kept under review for any future Funding

opportunities.

Councillor O’Donoghue noted the reply did not refer to new applications. The Senior

Scheme. The Town and Village Renewal Scheme is specifically for amenities and

walkways. Councillor O’Donoghue also referred to issues with flooding and signage in

Fedamore Village. The Senior Executive Engineer agreed to look into the issues raised

and revert in due course.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**6.**

**Notices of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Collins**

**I will move that Limerick City and County Council increases the Grass Cutting Grant for**

**estates so as to cover the cost of insurance that is now necessary so as to qualify for**

**the grant.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Teskey and

agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Collins stated insurance costs were using up half of

grant monies for volunteer groups and it was time the Government reviewed the issue.

Councillor Keary suggested it be requested the forthcoming 2022 budget cover

insurance costs for such grants. The Director, Housing advised Members this would be

considered a policy change and advised the matter be referred to the relevant SPC.

**Reply:**

Please note that having appropriate insurance cover has always been a

requirement in applying for grass cutting grants and the Council advise

Resident Associations/Groups who are undertaking the work to have

appropriate Public Liability and Employers Liability insurance in place.

The rising cost of insurance is an issue that has been raised nationally for

community groups and this needs to be addressed. There is no capacity to

increase the grants for 2021 however, the Council will review grant

payments for the 2022 scheme subject to budgetary requirements.

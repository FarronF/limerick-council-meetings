NOTICES OF MOTION

5.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Egan

I will move at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that

Limerick City and County Council do a survey of the old graveyard in Abington to see if there

are any vacant plots available. I would also like Limerick City and County Council to look into

the possibility of looking for an extension to Abington graveyard, Towerhill graveyard and

Ballinure graveyard.

**Proposed: Councillor Egan**

**Seconded: Councillor M Ryan**

**Reply:**

The Council wishes to advise that the old Graveyard in Abington is not in the ownership of

the Council. It is therefore not possible to survey the grounds as this burial ground is vested

in the Representative Church Body (RCB).

The Council recently prepared a Burial Ground strategy for Limerick. The capacity remaining

in all of the burial grounds in the City and County was determined. The strategy revealed

that there was five years capacity remaining in the Abington Burial ground. There was no

capacity remaining in the Towerhill or Ballinure burial grounds. Accordingly, the strategy

recommended a new burial ground to serve the Murroe/Cappamore areas. The Council will

progress with identifying possible sited for the new burial ground in the first quarter of

2022.

6.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will move at next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District that Irish Water

in conjunction with Limerick City and county Council, as announced in the next capital phase

of projects, will carry out the complete necessary works and investment to the Hospital

Sewerage Plant to comply with present regulations and make it fit for purpose to future

proof Hospital for future expansion in every aspect because of its strategic location between

Cork and Limerick on the R513.

**Proposed: Councillor Mitchell**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

**Reply:**

Please note below the response received from Irish Water. “As part of our Small Towns and

Villages Growth Programme, a project to provide additional treatment capacity and improve
---
compliance at Hospital WWTP was recently announced. This project will now continue

through the standard capital investment delivery processes and will be required to meet

governance and budgetary requirements at each phase. Further updates on timelines for

delivery will be provided as the project progresses.”

3. Transportation and Mobility Directorate

To receive update from the proposed bypasses for Abbeyfeale and
Newcastle West.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Senior Executive Engineer, Mid-West National Road Design
Office to the Meeting.

It was agreed by the Members that Councillor Galvin’s Question No. 8 would be taken as part
of Item 3.

The Senior Executive Engineer outlined to the Members the current situation with regard to
the proposed bypasses for Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West. He stated that a public
consultation process on the various route options took place from 1* February, 2021 to 5"
March, 2021, which was virtual because of Covid19 restrictions. Below is information on
same:

Newcastle West Abbeyfeale
Letter Drop 906 632
Website users 4,554 5,272
Virtual Room Visits 5,339 6,736
Submissions 287 194
Consultations 101 139

He explained that there are four route options for Abbeyfeale, one to the north and three to
the south of the town. He also stated that there are four route options for Newcastle West,
two to the north of the town and two in the south.

He stated that the Option Selection Process is ongoing at present and choosing the preferred
route is based on scoring all the route options on a set of criteria laid down by Transport
Infrastructure Ireland such as Economy, Safety, Environment, Accessibility and Social
Inclusion, Integration and Physical Activity and submissions from the public would also be
taken into account.

The Senior Executive Engineer stated that it is hoped that public consultation for the preferred
route would take place before the end of 2021. He informed the Members that the Council
planned to use the virtual experience for public consultation on the preferred routes with the
possibility of using some of the more traditional in person approaches also depending on
Covid19 mitigation measures in place at that time.

He stated that once the preferred route for both towns is chosen, the next step is to get
approval from Transport Infrastructure Ireland to conclude this phase and publish the
Selection Report. The next phase, Phase 3, involves developing the selected route within a
400mm wide corridor but the roadway once constructed would be between 60m and 100m
so although land maybe included in the initial 400m corridor, it may not be impacted directly
by the roadway. However, he stated that there is nothing definite about moving to Phase 3

or about funding for same at the present time but was hopeful of approval to progress to
Phase 3.

The Members thanked the Senior Executive Engineer for the comprehensive presentation and
referred to a number of matters including the holding of a Public Consultation Process
in-person, what determines the decision of the route, are environmental factors considered,
planning sterilisation along all the routes. The Members also referred to the timeframe for
funding for the project, connectivity into Kerry and the progression of the Adare by pass.

In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the lifting of planning sterilisations
would not happen straight away and it may be February 2022 before lands are freed up. He
also stated that An Bérd Pleandla’s decision on the Limerick to Foynes route, which includes
a by-pass for Adare has been delayed but the new date is October 26.

4. Support Services Directorate

To receive presentation on General Data Protection Regulations
GDPR) and Elected bers.

The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Data Protection Officer, Corporate Services, Governance,
and Customer Services to the Meeting.

The Data Protection Officer commenced by stating that the purpose of the presentation is to
explain the access that Elected Members have to the personal data of a customer.

He outlined to the Members the Role of the Councillors under the following headings:

Policy role of elected Council
Local Government Act 2001 (as amended)
e Section 130 — Function of the elected Council of a Local Authority to determine by
resolution the policy of the Local Authority subject to and in accordance with this Act.
© Functions of a Local Authority are divided into Reserved and Executive Functions.

He referred to Section 136 Furnishing of Information to Elected Members and to Section 151
Register of Orders which is available at every Council Meeting. He outlined to the Members
the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988 (as amended) which included that data is to
be processed lawfully and fairly, that data is to be collected for specific and legitimate
purposes and that appropriate security measures are taken against unauthorised access.

He also referred to GDPR Article 5 Principles of Processing which notes that personal data
shall be:

Processed lawfully, carefully and in a transparent manner
© Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in
a manner that is incompatible with those purposes

¢ Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for
which they are processed.


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
He made reference to the GDPR Article 6 Lawful Basis which states that processing is
necessary for compliance with a legal obligation and for the performance of a task carried out
in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

He outlined to the Members the DPC advice regarding putting personal data in the public
domain for example that it be necessary and proportionate to publish and share and that it
does comply with the principle of data minimisation.

In conclusion, the Data Protection Officer stated that the Council must balance the
requirements of any specific legislation in relation to publishing or sharing personal data
against the requirements of the GDPR and related legislation and where Elected Members
have a concern in relation to any business or transaction of the Local Authority their powers
under Section 136 of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) come into play.

The Members thanked the Data Protection Officer for the presentation. It was noted that the
Elected Members are in effect, the Board of Directors of the Council and therefore should be
entitled to know the business workings of the Council and have access to information in this
regard. The Members also referred to signatures on forms and in replying, the Data
Protection Officer stated that the advice from the DPC is that when processing Special
Category Data consent is required and form is to be signed in this instance by the person who
the Elected Member is representing. Following a query from the Members, the Data
Protection Officer confirmed that the policy was agreed at National Level for all Local
Authorities.

Following discussion, it was proposed by Councillor Sheahan, seconded by Councillor Galvin
that a Working Group be set up comprising of the Elected Members, Executive, Data
Protection Officer and the Chief Executive to discuss this matter further. It was also agreed
that the Data Protection Officer would seek legal advice on whether a Councillor as a Board
of Director Member of the Council is entitled to information on the business workings of the
Council. The Data Protection Officer did note that the signing of consent forms only related
to personal or sensitive information transactions.

The Director referred to the District allocations under the Development Fund for 2021, which
makes a provision of €250,000 for the Metropolitan/Municipal Districts - €100,000 for the
Metropolitan District and €50,000 for each Municipal District. He stated that in 2020
Development Fund monies were allocated towards the part funding of work on the Ardagh
and Barnagh Stationhouses as part of the Limerick Greenway project. He recommended that
the 2021 provision of €50,000 also be allocated to the Ardagh and Barnagh Stationhouse
projects as additional works were required to complete these projects and included the
upgrading of the unfinished platforms and grounds around the Stationhouses.

While the allocation of this additional funding to the Limerick Greenway Project was agreed
by all the Members, they also referred to the lack of funding from the Municipal District of
Adare/Rathkeale in support of the Limerick Greenway. They noted that the project benefits
all of West Limerick and should be supported as it is a wonderful amenity for the area and is
driving tourism in the county.

QUESTIONS

Colbert Terrace, Abbeyfeale (c) the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan.

REPLY:

(a) Since the previous update on the scheme, prolonged discussions have taken place
with the landowner regarding access and other design issues. These have been largely
resolved and are being incorporated into the design by our technical consultants,
Barry Transportation. Ongoing valuation discussions are progressing to seek
agreement with the landowner for the acquisition of the lands required.

The CCTV survey and slit trench investigation contractors are nearing appointment
and once we receive the results of these investigations Barry Transportation will
finalise their design, including design of the necessary water main diversion, and their
discussions with Irish Water.

review at the end of July this year. They reverted and noted that the current cost per
house exceed the maximum budget as set out by the Department.

Housing Construction and Maintenance are currently reviewing costs in a bid to
reduce them and hope to have a revised Stage 3 to the Department of Housing, Local
Government and Heritage by mid November 2021.

(c) A meeting have taken place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland over funding for the
scheme. The TIl have requested a detailed breakdown of funding which is currently
being prepared and further meetings will be arranged to try and secure funding for

NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will move at the next Meeting that providers who rent bicycles along our Green Way be
allowed access to the storage units at Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan.
REPLY:

The structures referred to are a single storage container that are now in place at each of the
Limerick Greenway car parks at Rathkeale, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.

As the elected members are aware, the Council ran an Expression of Interest process for a
bike hire and shuttle bus provider to operate from these Council car parks and the successful
company was Lazy Bikes.

These storage containers are provided as part of a licence agreement for Lazy Bikes to operate
from these car parks and are therefore not available to other bike hire providers.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

Newcastle West.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan referred to the opening hours of the Garda
Station in Newcastle West and to the level of service provided. A brief discussion followed
and the Members expressed disappointment at the length of time taken to commence the
building of the new Garda Station. It was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would write

to Minister O’Donovan and Minister Humphreys on this matter and that this item be
discussed again at the Joint Policing Committee Meeting which is to be held in October.

It was noted that the Cathaoirleach had been on National television recently with regard
to anti-social behaviour in the District.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council calls on the Minister to give back ownership

would call on this Government to put in place a properly financed 10 year working plan to
upgrade the above.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that the current system in place is

not satisfactory. It was agreed that the Meetings Administrator would refer this Notice of

At this point, Councillor Collins left the Meeting.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will move at the next Meeting that all representations made by Councillors to the Sugar
CRM system will have the responses sent back by email also.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The SugarCRM database assists the Council in the management of all service requests logged
for the Council. it allows cases to be tracked and managed, with a view to achieving the

11


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
optimum outcomes for the Councillors and Citizens of Limerick. In 2020, 34,863 cases were
created. Of these, 28,300 cases closed in 2020. This confirms a closure rate of 82% rate on
service requests.

The following is the position for cases created by Councillors in 2020

Created by Councillors in 2020
Created & Closed in 2020

Created in 2020 & Closed in 2021
Total closed to up to 27.09.21

The system is designed so that when a case is created on CRM, an automated email is
generated. The email confirms the unique case number for the service request. This supports
the monitoring of a case throughout its lifecycle. There are a number of distinct phases to
the case management process

Creation

Updates requests
Status changes
Case Closure

Each of the above, results in an email being generated and sent to the Councillor.

In the last 6 months, input was sought from the elected members who are representatives on
the Councillors CRM working group. The consultation was in relation to the volume of emails
generated from within the platform. Following this consultation process, the Councillors
agreed that S email formats should remain in use.

1.

Acknowledgement email : This email confirms the Unique Case Number. It also
provides confirmation that all future information requests should be sought by
replying to the acknowledgement email.

In Progress — this is generated to advise the Councillor when the status of the case has
changed to In Progress. This is to communicate the fact that some action is being
undertaken on the service request contained within the case.

Direct emails from within the case : These are manually generated, as required by
Council Officials. It allows for ongoing updates to be furnished to the Councillor before
a case is formally closed.

Update requests by the Councillors: This email acknowledges that an elected member
may have submitted some additional information on the request, or has sought an
update. It advises the recipient of the name of team to whom the service request has
been assigned to.

Case closure : This email confirms the status at which the case has been closed and
records the message that has been posted to the public log.

It is important to note that all of the above contains the unique case number and the subject
line, which contains a brief description that the Councillor gave, when making the service
request. In very rare instances, the subject line may have had some minor edits applied to it

12


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
— these edits are usually undertaken to remove any personal or sensitive data that may have

been recorded in the subject line. This policy is in place to ensure that the Council is compliant
with the provisions of GDPR legislation.

in addition to the above, training on CRM case creation and management is delivered to staff
throughout the organisation. Particular emphasis is placed on the correct status being utilised
throughout the life cycle of the case, i.e. assigned, in progress and one of our closed statuses,
which includes: - Resolved, Closed Unresolved, or Closed with Commitment. Staff are aware
of the importance that is placed on the content of the updates posted in the public log. Every
effort is made to ensure that it fully reflects the status of the case and sets out clearly the
Council's position in relation to the request.

To support this process, additional actions are undertaken to ensure the optimum
management of cases. These include, the provision of monthly reports to the Senior
Management Team, reporting trends where necessary and escalating cases to assignees to
ensure timely and adequate responses are received.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin stated that the system in place suits the Local
Authority but however is not a workable system for the Members. He queried the meaning
of the Closed with Commitment and Case Resolved status on the system. The lack of
signatures on responses to representations was also discussed and it was noted that the
Newcastle West Roads Engineer also includes his name in responses to representations. It

was also noted that there is poor attendance at the Working Group on CRM which was set up
with the Members.

The following items were also raised.

At the September Municipal District Meeting clarification was also sought on the proposed
development at Woodfield Manor, Newcastle West and if the provision of social housing or
affordable housing is the preferred option at this estate. The Meetings Administrator stated
that clarification had been received from the Housing Department. The Woodfield Manor
development is in 2 phases and phase 1 contains 19 units and phase 2 contains 11 units. It is
noted that phase 1 is a form of starter housing at a discount under the New Build
incremental Purchase Scheme. Phase 2 has to be confirmed.

An update was sought on when works are going to be carried out to remedy dereliction at a
number of vacant Council properties in the District. In replying, the Director agreed to raise
the matter of individual houses with the Director, Housing. Following discussion, it was agreed
that this matter be further discussed at a Workshop on Housing which is due to take place on
Wednesday, 27" October, 2021.

The safety measures carried out at Gleason’s Cross, Cratloe was acknowledged. However, an
update was sought on the safety measures from the bend up from Gleason’s Cross on the

Abbeyfeale to Athea Road. In replying, the Executive Engineer stated that it is proposed to
remove the bend and improve sight lines at this location.

The Meetings Administrator stated that a number of months ago, it was agreed with the
Members that a Deputation from Meadow Court Residents Association could attend a
meeting of the District. However given the Covid 19 restrictions which were in place with
Meetings taking place online, the delegation did not attend. It is envisaged that the delegation
may now attend the November Meeting of the District.

It was agreed to hold the Draft Budgetary Meeting 2022 on Wednesday, 20" October, 2021,

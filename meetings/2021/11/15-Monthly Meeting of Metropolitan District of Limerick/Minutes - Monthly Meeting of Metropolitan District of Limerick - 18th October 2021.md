**Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to detail annual spending***

***on housing provision through long term leasing over the past five years and projected spending***

***on same in the coming five years and to name the companies/developers with whom Limerick***

***City and County Council currently has such contracts.***

**REPLY**: With Limerick City and County Council, leases with commercial entities commenced in

2019, in line with Government policy to enable this social-rental supply stream. The table

below sets the unit type, number of units and average monthly rent for commercial entities

availing of long-term leasing with Limerick City and County Council. The rent paid to Lessors

under the scheme is 80% of market rent for houses in a non-managed development and

85% market rent where management fees apply for units in a managed development. Rent

reviews under standard long-term leasing occur on the third anniversary of the

commencement date and every third year thereafter. These reviews are based on changes

in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Data on average spend on monthly rent

therefore has been collated for 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Last month, the Government launched Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland. On

page 21 of that document, it states the Government’s intention to “end long-term leasing

of social housing by Local Authorities and AHBs through phasing out new entrants and

focussing on new-build to provide social homes.” Therefore, projected long term lease

arrangements and associated spend over the next 5 years are anticipated to be low.

Long-term lease arrangements, including the enhanced lease, of privately owned dwellings

can be entered into by either local authorities or AHBs. Under these arrangements, the local

authority or AHB acts as the landlord to the tenant. The terms of these agreements are set

out in standard template agreements provided by my Department, which must be used, by

all local authorities and AHBs. Agreements may be entered into for periods of between 10

to 25 years in duration; availability agreements under the CALF scheme can be up to 30

years in duration.

Since the leasing arrangements commenced with Limerick City and County Council in 2019,

the following commercial entities have signed Long Term Lease Agreements with the

Limerick City and County Council:

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can Limerick City and***

***County Council take in charge the laneways at the back of Lynwood Park houses as there are a***

***lot of elderly people living in the area that just cannot keep them maintained.***
---
8

**REPLY**: In order to declare such a road as a public road the provisions of Section 11 of the Roads

Act, 1993 must be considered. However, there are a number of issues that need to

be carefully considered before such a process is initiated including but not limited to:-

(i) The road being of general public utility

(ii) The financial implications to the Roads Authority (including current & future liabilities)

(iii) Public consultation / advertising of intent.

(iv) Consideration of objections.

The lanes referenced are currently only accessible via locked gates and therefore

are not currently a public right of way.

Furthermore, as the lanes serve primarily as an access to premises they would not

be considered to be of general public utility.

As proposed there is not merit in further consideration for such a declaration in respect of

these lanes.

10.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can I have an update on***

***the status of the internet connection for the new development at Woodlawn Park, they have not***

***had internet connection since been allocated these houses.***

**REPLY**: New estate infrastructure developed by Limerick City and County Council includes all the

technical ducting required by Media Companies to deliver the various telephony and media

connections to Council Tenants.

Where Media Companies often struggle to provide connections is associated with making

the external link to the new estate. This is not an area the Council can deliver directly.

However, we are engaged directly with Media Companies to bridge the gaps in the various

estates and a Woodlawn solution is planned by a Media company in the coming weeks.

11.

**Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, can you advise if there is a***

***scheme available or any plans to introduce a recycling scheme to dispose of plastic bottles for***

***sports clubs in Limerick City and County.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council proactively promote across a wide range of measures that

all citizens embrace reuse with the objective of reducing the use of single use plastic bottles

in Limerick. In the event that there are used single use plastic bottles for recycling, sports

clubs are reminded to use their dry recyclable collection, (which under waste legislation is

part of their own segregated waste service collection), to recycle plastic bottles. The

Council will review the outcome and the learnings from “The Green Club Programme”

which will be shared with GAA and other clubs across the county. “The Green Club

Programme” is a partnership between the GAA, LGFA and Camogie Association and local

authorities across Ireland and is structured around five key areas; Waste, Water,
---
9

Biodiversity, Energy and Travel and Transportation. St. Patrick’s GAA is one of several GAA

Clubs that have been chosen nationally to participate in the pilot phase of the programme.

12.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***feasibility study for footpaths along the Rosbrien Road.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council is to submit an application for funding for development

of these works.

13.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the plans***

***for the Old Garda Barracks in Lord Edward Street.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council has acquired the remainder of the OPW leasehold interest

in the Old Garda Barracks in Lord Edward Street. We are in the process of securing the

freehold interest in the property. This is complex and until the freehold title is secured, a

decision cannot be made as to the future treatment of the premises.

14.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick who is responsible for the***

***upkeep and maintenance of the Canal Bank, given its deteriorating state at present, and will the***

***Council encourage all stakeholders (i.e. Waterways Ireland, ESB, UL and the Council) meet and***

***take responsibility for this very important amenity.***

**REPLY**: The Council has met with Waterways Ireland in relation to the maintenance of the Canal

and discussed a number of maintenance measures for the Canal, in particular the Lock Quay

area. Waterways Ireland will undertake a programme of work that will see the railings

painted at Lock Quay, the brick paving replaced and all rubbish in the canal removed.

Waterways Ireland have advised that this programme of work will take place in the next

number of weeks. It is expected that the works will be completed by mid-November.

Waterways Ireland will also arrange for the vegetation in the Canal at Lock Quay to be

removed. They will prepare a Screening Report and will seek the appropriate environmental

permissions to have the vegetation removed. The presence of the algal bloom was also

discussed with Waterways Ireland. It is expected that the algae will dissipate as the

temperature drops over the next number of weeks.

The Council are in the process of seeking additional equipment to assist with the

maintenance of the verges along the canal. This will provide the necessary assistance

required to maintain the length of vegetation along the canal.

15.

**Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many HAP inspections***

***are expected to be carried out in the Metropolitan area once the Covid rules permit so.***
---
10

**REPLY**: Covid Restrictions have significantly impacted the ability of the Private Rented Inspections

Team to carry out regular duties in person. Housing Support services have engaged in virtual

inspections with Tenants and Landlords during restrictions but this has proven difficult at

times as we respect the rights of Tenants to protect their families.

We estimate in the region of a further 300 inspections to be completed by the 3 members

of the team by the end of 2021. This takes into account the time consuming Inspection,

Reports, Photographs and follow-up with Landlord.

16.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council have received***

***a response from the TII on the final cost benefit assessment report concerning the M7 Noise and***

***if there is an update on this matter.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council has received numerous complaints re road noise

in Annacotty/Monaleen/Castletroy

and Ballycummin over

a

number

of

years.

Complainants allege that the road noise is causing annoyance, sleep disruption, adverse

effects to health and restricted usage of gardens.

The Council is required under Environmental Noise Regulations to prepare a Noise

Action Plan, which is incorporated as part of the City and County Development Plan. The

purpose of the plan is to reduce noise levels where they are high, protect noise quality

where it is good and to avoid local populations being exposed to high noise levels.

In response to the complaints the Council has investigated these two locations, under the

Noise Action Plan and entered into dialogue with TII in relation to these matters.

In addition the Council undertook cost benefit analyses on the benefits to health of

implementing measures versus the actual cost of their implementation. Reports were

completed and submitted to TII for its consideration.

The reports set out a number of potential mitigation options and it is a matter for TII to

consider their implementation. The Council and TII are in continued dialogue in relation to

these matters and pending a reply from TII, the Members will be updated.

It is the responsibility of local authorities, under their Noise Action Plans, to make

recommendations on noise intervention measures to TII for the national road network.

Members should note that the Council is the first local authority to undertake a project of

this nature in collaboration with TII.

17.

**Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, if the green areas in the***

***housing estates near UL can be included into the Council’s Blue Green infrastructure for the*** ***City.***

**REPLY**: The purpose of the Blue-Green Infrastructure Strategy is to identify existing and future

parks and green spaces; assess existing parks for their value and accessibility; identify gaps
---
11

in the provision of quality open space; and recommend opportunities for the upgrade of

existing and the future expansion of BGI in the city and environs.

The BGI Strategy will not be considering specific green space in estates, but the strategy will

likely be making overall recommendations for the protection and enhancement of green

spaces, in addition to recommendations for our existing parks and opportunity sites.

18.

**Question submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, to purchase a Gully Sucker***

***with jets to clean gullies before the problem of flooding arises for Limerick city and county.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council has a contract in place to address such matters including

the Patrickswell area are included in this contract.

19.

**Question submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, from Cement Roundabout***

***on N69 along the Dock Road to Limerick City Hotel Roundabout, there are briers \ weeds \ moss,***

***etc. that badly need to be cleaned. This is a major approach road to Limerick city, which is in a***

***deplorable condition.***

**REPLY**: It is our intention to address roadside verges and hedges on this section of road in the

coming weeks along with a number of other City Centre approach roads needing such

attention.

20.

**Question submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to provide funding for tree***

***surgeons in the Limerick City West area to the tune of 50,000 euro. I hope this would be approved***

***in the upcoming budget.***

**REPLY**: The Council provides an annual budget in the order of €90,000 for tree surgery works. Any

increase in the existing budget can be addressed as part of the budgetary process.

21.

**Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the rollout***

***of Smart Bins to replace our existing street bins.***

**REPLY**: Further to recent grant funding provided we are currently at tender stage for procurement

of new ‘Smart Bins’ for the Metropolitan District. It is expected that installation of the new

bins will commence in December following a successful award of tender.

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) expressed disappointment at the decision to close

the AIB branch on the Ennis Road and remove the ATM, in particular as there was a large elderly

with mobility issues when footpaths and cycle lanes were obstructed.

and Secas referred to ongoing issues experienced by residents in estates adjoining the University

of Limerick, in relation to students residing in these estates. Some of the issues being experienced

included congregation and noise issues in student houses in estates; high levels of car usage and

associated parking problems; littering and incidents of anti-social behaviour; concerns associated

with the current Covid health pandemic and clean up and street cleaning costs being incurred by

the local authority.

The Members agreed that the University needed to be part of the solution in addressing these

issues and also address the requirement for additional onsite campus accommodation for

students.

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council call on the Community, Leisure and Culture SPC to timetable at its next meeting***

***for a strategic discussion the following issue:***

***- the sense of community and place of the residential community in estates near UL is being***

***fundamentally damaged by the Council’s failure to protect these ‘10 minute*** ***walk***

***neighbourhoods’ from the devastating effects of the*** ***ever expanding UL student intake. This***

***along with the high dependence of UL management on privately managed, houses of multiple***

***occupancy (HMOs) to accommodate the majority of their students, with many HMOs being***

***inappropriately managed. These issues, coupled with the student accommodation crisis and the***

***antisocial behaviour of some UL students, are damaging the residential community resulting thus***

***in a trend of many residents being forced out of their homes over the years.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Community, Leisure and Culture Strategic Policy

Committee.

***the city and its environs and to support local businesses to be more visible on their respective***

***streets / areas.***

Strategic Policy Committee.

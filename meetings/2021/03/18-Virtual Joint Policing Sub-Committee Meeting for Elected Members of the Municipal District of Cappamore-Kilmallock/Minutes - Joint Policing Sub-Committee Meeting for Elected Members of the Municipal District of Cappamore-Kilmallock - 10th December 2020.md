In relation to crime in the district, the Drugs Unit has noted an increase in drug detection.

There are two new members of the Drugs Unit stationed in Bruff Garda Station, with a main

focus on drug related issues in the Bruff region.

Drug detections increased from 7 in 2019 to 29 in 220.

Superintendent Dermot O’Connor noted that the area within the Municipal District covered

by Roxboro Garda Station had proved to be relatively quiet in 2020.

An overview of statistics for the Ballyneety area from 1st January 2020 to 10th December 2020

outlined that

 Property crime had reduced from 34 incidents in 2019 to 15 in 2020

 Crimes against the person had reduced from 5 to 4

In Caherconlish

 Property theft had reduced from 40 incidents in 2019 to 20 in 2020.

Additional checkpoints had been set up in this area during Level 5 restrictions. A reduction in

traffic on the roads was noted, yet there were 27 traffic collisions in 2019 compared to 25 in

2020.

Local issues including the speed detection van in Kilmallock, suspected “sulky racing”, the new

operating model, CCTV cameras, property marking, Gardai lone working and Burglaries were

discussed.

An agreement was reached that the speed van in Kilmallock would only be based there at

night.

It was acknowledged that although the CCTV in Kilmallock does not cover the whole town,

the coverage currently available has proved useful, and An Garda Síochána would be fully

supportive if extra coverage was provided. A tenfold increase in behaviour warnings issued

has been noted (10 in 2020 compared to 1 in 2019).

Recent “Sulky races” which were interrupted are now the subject of criminal investigation.

It was clarified that Gardai work together and back up is available from Roxboro Garda station

if required.

Clarification was provided that there was no pattern to burglaries, and in 2020 there were

very few burglaries as households were occupied more often. In relation to the detection

rate, it was noted that of 72 burglaries, 13 were marked as detected.

The Elected Members wished to acknowledge the work of An Garda Síochána including Garda

Taghnan in relation to their support for James’ Journey

Further clarification on the operating model and property marking will be sought at the next

JPC meeting.---

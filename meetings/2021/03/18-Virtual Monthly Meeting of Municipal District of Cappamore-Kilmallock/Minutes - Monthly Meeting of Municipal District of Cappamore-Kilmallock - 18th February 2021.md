Hospital

Kilmallock Roads have committed to undertaking design works on this junction in relation to

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District meeting what

8. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore/Kilmallock Municipal District if there are any

plans to upgrade Kilmallock Business Park to fibre optic broadband.

**REPLY:**

Premises in the Kilmallock Business Park fall outside of the State Intervention Area, as it is

defined by the National Broadband Plan. The rural deployment of high speed broadband

outside of the State Intervention Area is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions as

to the areas, premises and timelines for deployment and service activation are made by Eir

internally and on a commercial basis. The Council and the Department of Communications

have no visibility on these schedules and timelines, nor do they have any statutory authority

to intervene in that process.

However, I have checked a number of eircodes of premises in the Kilmallock Business Park

with OpenEir, and the feedback for all eircodes was that FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet)

broadband was already available to each one.

If there is a particular premises that has reported an issue getting access to a fibre

connection in the Kilmallock Business Park, please have them contact the Limerick

Broadband Officer by email at broadband@limerick.ie for assistance with their issue.

Any Other Business

**Dog Fouling**

Concern was raised regarding the issue of dog fouling, and it was agreed to request

area.

**Proposed Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028**

The Elected Members wished to express their thanks to Hugh McGrath, Senior Engineer,

and his team for their support in relation to the proposed Limerick Development Plan

2022-2028. Concern was raised by the Elected Members regarding the need for applicants

for planning permission to have a social and economic link to an area. It was suggested that

Councillor E Ryan as chairperson of the SPC on Environment, and Mayor of Limerick,

Councillor Collins, request a meeting with Minister Darragh O’Brien to highlight these

concerns. The Elected Members discussed how this approach would be made.

**River Court, Galbally**

The Elected Members acknowledged the 25 year Leases signed for 7 houses in River Court,

Galbally recently which are now occupied.

3.

Operations and Maintenance Services Directorate

To consider report on Roads Act 1994 Section 38(3) process as

amended by the Public Transportation Regulation Act, 2009 (Section

46), with regard to the introduction of traffic calming measures on

Nash’s Lane at Newcastle West Square between Bank of Ireland and

Aldi.

Circulated, report of Senior Executive Engineer, Operations and Maintenance Services, dated

7th January, 2021.

The Senior Executive Engineer referred to the proposed introduction of traffic calming

measures and the prohibition of vehicular access to and from The Square, Newcastle West to

Nash’s Lane, Newcastle West. He stated that it was proposed to install a bollard at the Town

Square end of Nash’s Lane to restrict vehicular access only and that access to all properties

would still be available via Churchtown/Demesne area. He referred to the absence of

sightlines when entering the Square from Nash’s Lane which pose a serious Health and Safety

risk. He also referred to the pedestrian/vehicular conflict at this junction which endangers

public safety. He stated that as this matter is a Reserved Function of the Council, approval

of the Members was now being sought to place a bollard at the Town Square end of Nash’s

Lane, Newcastle West.

A lengthy discussion followed and the Senior Executive Engineer confirmed that that a public

consultation process had taken place and a total of nine submissions were received

expressing objections to the proposed provision of a bollard at the above location.

The Members acknowledged the safety issue at this location and following discussion

suggested an alternative option which included the placing of a bollard at the other end of

Nash’s Lane. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the placing of a bollard at

this end would not be addressing the issue of safety at the junction and would provide limited

access to the area.

The option of a retractable bollard with fobs being given to the property owners who have

public right of way to Nash’s Lane was also discussed. In replying, the Senior Executive

Engineer stated that this option would prove expensive and public liability may also be an

issue. A simpler collapsible barrier was also discussed.

While all Members were in favour of progressing the project, it was proposed by Councillor

Collins and seconded by Councillor Sheahan that the decision be deferred to allow for further

consultation with those who have a Right of Way on the laneway. It was agreed that the

Senior Executive Engineer would follow up on this matter and revert back to the Members.

NOTICES OF MOTION

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Minister for Housing to include***

***derelict houses in the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government backed mortgage scheme for first-time

buyers available nationwide from local authorities. A Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme

provides up to 90% of the market value of the property. The maximum market value of the

property that can be purchased or self-built, is €250,000 in Limerick.

One of key criteria of the Local Authority Rebuilding Ireland Loans Credit Policy 2018 made

under the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018 (S.I. No. 25 of 2018), is

that the property must, “be in good condition and have good marketable title”.

Where the property is sourced by the applicant on the open market, “Certificate of

compliance with planning and building regulations are required on completion for all

properties mortgaged and must be provided by suitably qualified architects, engineers, or

building surveyors. The form of compliance shall be those approved by the Royal Irish

Architects Ireland (R.I.A.I), Engineers Ireland (E.I.) or the Society of Chartered Surveyors

(S.C.S.)”.

The Motion is timely given the presence on Home Loan applications. It raises issues around

Policy on Government backed Home Loan Schemes. The Motion warrants further in-depth

discussion and, in this regard, and with the Members approval, it is recommended that it be

referred to the Housing SPC.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin requested that derelict buildings be included in

the qualifying parameters of the Scheme. A discussion followed and it was agreed that this

matter be referred to a Meeting of the Home and Community SPC.

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will move at the next Meeting*** ***that this Council support Corran Deel Voluntary Housing in***

***their quest to buy lands and build 8-10 houses that are so badly needed not alone in***

***Feenagh/Kilmeedy but in most villages.***
---
9

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

The Housing Development Directorate are positively working with Corran Deel

Voluntary Housing at present to support a Capital Acquisition Scheme

application in Feenagh prior to a formal application to the Department of

Housing, Local Government and Heritage. An assessment involving demand

and house type mix is currently being investigated with Corran Deel Voluntary

Housing Association and the proposed scheme may be phased depending on

the outcome of the assessment. This will be determined in the coming weeks.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin referred to the need for social housing in our

smaller towns and villages in the District.

15. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Foley

***I will move at the next Meeting*** ***that funding be sought to narrow the wide footpath on***

***Convent Road, Abbeyfeale, in the interest of safety.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

This request has been forwarded to Design and Delivery for consideration

under the Abbeyfeale Traffic Management Plan.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Foley

***I will move at the next Meeting*** ***that road works be carried out on the Knocknagorna Road***

***where the bridge was repaired.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Galvin.

REPLY:

As an interim measure, tar patching will be carried out on this roadway.

Also the roadway will be considerred for inclusion in the 2021 Roadworks

Programme.

17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting*** ***that a footpath extension be provided on the left hand side***

***of the road along the R520 from Kerry Co-Op to the speed limit sign.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Ruddle.

REPLY:

The provision of a footpath, drainage, public lighting and river embankment

protection would involve significant expenditure and would also involve land

acquisition at the above location.
---
10

An updated cost estimate based on the requirement for a detailed design along

with a retaining wall with stone facing could incur expenditure in the region of

€300,000 to complete the requested works.

Also this request would be subject to land acquisition and a source of funding

needs to be identified for provision of this footpath over a distance of 500m

serving 7 houses.

Liaison with Inland Fisheries Ireland and the OPW is also necessary due to the

close proximity of the River Arra to the Regional Road R520.

Part 8 Planning is also required due to the extent of the works involved.

18. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

**I will move at the next Meeting that pedestrian crossings be provided at the North and**

**Liscarroll Roads along the R522 at Dromcollogher in the interest of safety locally.**

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

REPLY:

There has been a number of requests for Pedestrian Crossings throughout the

Newcastle West Municipal District recently, namely Abbeyfeale Soccer Club,

Sheehan’s Road, Newcastle West and now two for Dromcollogher.

With respect to Dromcollogher, a number of Pedestrian Crossings are

identified as part of the Dromcollogher Draft Public Realm Plan.

The location of these proposed pedestrian crossings is an integral part of the

Draft Plan which is likely to go to Public Consultation during 2021.

Construction of Pedestrian Crossings at this stage is premature pending an

agreed Public Realm Plan.

In the interim, a source of funding needs to be identified for any proposed

justified pedestrian crossings.

In addition, suitable locations needs to be addressed as expenditure is

dependent on the amount of associated civil works required.

The following items were also raised.

An update was sought on the hedgegrow between Churchview Estate and the Parochial

House at Castlemahon. In replying, the Executive Engineer stated that works were carried

out at this location before Christmas and the area has now been tidied up.
---
11

An update on the provision of safety measures along the R522 between Tiermeana Bridge

and Ardnacrohy Height was requested. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that

a speed survey was undertaken and the results of the survey have been forwarded to An

Garda Síochána.

An update was sought on the carrying out of works at Ward’s Cross and Devon Cross,

Templeglantine. In replying, the Director agreed to raise this matter with the relevant

Directorate.

The provision of safety measures on the Pallas side of the Priest’s house when approaching

Kilmeedy along the R519 from Tireagh Cross was raised. The Executive Engineer stated that

this matter will be considered for a Low Cost Safety Scheme and as an interim measure road

markings and signage will be improved in the area.

The holding of a Meeting with representatives of the Board of Management of SMI to discuss

traffic congestion in the vicinity of the school was raised. In replying, the Meetings

Administrator stated that a Meeting would be arranged when the Level 5 Covid19 restrictions

were lifted.

An update was sought on the provision of funding for a pedestrian crossing at Abbeyfeale

United Soccer Club. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that a submission had

been made under Active Travel proposals and that funding is expected.

The Members acknowledged the excellent work carried out at the Great Southern Greenway.

However, an update was sought on when the section of the Greenway to Newcastle West

would be opened. In replying, the Director stated that due to Level 5 Covid 19 restrictions

construction work had ceased but works would commence again when the restrictions were

lifted. The new title for the Greenway, the Limerick Greenway was also raised.

The condition of the road surface at the Garda Station, Mountmahon, was also raised. In

replying, the Senior Executive Engineer confirmed that temporary road surface work had

been carried out a number of years--ago and that considerable funding has now been

acquired for the complete resurfacing of the road at this location.

The build up of silt in the eye of the bridge in Athea was raised and a request was made that

this matter be addressed. In replying, the Executive Engineer stated that he would liaise with

the Office of Public Works on this matter.

An update was sought on the taking in charge of Rays Estate, Mountcollins. The Senior

Executive Engineer stated that a costing had been submitted to the Planning Directorate and

a response is awaited. However, he stated that no bond exists for this estate.

The heating systems currently in place in some Local Authority houses were referred to and

a request was made that the name of a dedicated contact person be made available to the

tenants of newly allocated houses to address any issues they may have.

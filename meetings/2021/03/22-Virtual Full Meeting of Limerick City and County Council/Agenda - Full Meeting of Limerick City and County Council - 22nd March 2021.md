NOTICES OF MOTION

11.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale

(Councillors J. O’Donoghue (Proposer), B. Collins, S. Keary, E. O’Brien, K.

Sheahan, A. Teskey) (to be referred to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and

Environment SPC)

We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council immediately

address the safe passage of people on our local, regional and national roads by way of

ensuring that all roads have a clear margin of at least 1m to a height of 4m all year

round, so that our school buses, pedestrians, cyclists and all other forms of transport

can use our roads safely.

12.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors J. Leddin, E. Secas, C. Sheehan

We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, recognising

the scale of the Housing crisis, reaffirm its commitment to work with Government and

all relevant agencies towards delivering new housing units and, in particular, ensuring

that sufficient Social and Affordable housing is built for those in need of same.

Recognising, however, its duty to use Limerick City and County Council property in the

best interests of society, this Council reject the provisions contained in the Land

Development Agency Bill, 2021, published by the Government, removing the role of

the Elected Members of Local Authorities in approving the transfer or sale of lands to

the Land Development Agency.

The Council further agrees to write to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and

Heritage urging a removal of that provision and to ensure that Elected Councillors

retain the right to control such sales or transfers and be able to prepare and plan for

appropriate housing delivery on Council-owned lands.

The Council further agrees to circulate this Motion to each Local Authority and the

Association of Irish Local Government requesting their support for this.

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

I will move at the next Meeting that a Bill for the appointment of an Independent Meat

Regulator with statutory powers is drafted with a view to the Government / Minister

for Agriculture appointing such a Regulator. The purpose of the Independent Meat

Regulator with the necessary associated legislative powers would be to police and

regulate the Meat Industry.---

I will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to the Minister for Children,

Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, asking him to urgently intervene to find a

permanent solution for the children living in the Knockalisheen Direct Provision

closure of the on-site pre-school facility.

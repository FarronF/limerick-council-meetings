The Mayor commenced the Meeting by welcoming the Members and members of the public

and press who were present online for the Meeting. He stated that the Special Meeting had

been convened to discuss the issue as set out in the Requisition received on 25th January,

2021, and signed by a number of Members as follows:

**“We, the undersigned Members wish to submit an Emergency Motion calling on the**

**Minister for Transport, Mr. Eamon Ryan, T.D.,** **to meet with the Members as a matter**

**of urgency to discuss the Coonagh Knockalisheen Road.**

**We therefore request a Special Meeting to discuss this Motion.”**

**Signed: Councillors S. Benson, J. Costelloe, E. Secas, C. Sheehan, J. Leddin.**

The Mayor then gave his full support to the commencement and completion of the Coonagh

to Knockalisheen Road in full. He said the road was arguably the single biggest and most

important project of Limerick Regeneration, and that the people of Moyross were fully

supportive of the construction of this road as they saw its importance to all residents in the

area, and that Limerick Chamber was behind the road, as was Limerick Institute of

Technology. He said the Government had announced funding for the delivery of its

*Programme for Government,* which mentioned the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road, and that

a third of the project budget had already been spent on a number of enabling works with
---

contractors now waiting at the starting line to begin the road proper. He pointed out that the

project was so well advanced that aerial photographs of the site showed exactly where the

road would be and that the entire route would have footpaths and segregated cycleways, as

well as creating a whole new amenity.

He also made it clear that supporting the construction of the road did not mean pitting

alternative forms of transport against each other and that each one had a part to play in the

development of Limerick. He said rail transport needed critical mass, cycleways, and that

walkways needed to be safe and accessible and that road, rail, bicycle and on-foot

infrastructure was vital to have a thriving, vibrant, healthy and attractive Limerick - it was just

that the road infrastructure element was further advanced than the others at present for this

particular project.

The Mayor concluded by saying that the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road was not just a road,

it was a serious statement of intent - to the people of Moyross, to the communities on the

northside of Limerick, to those hoping to buy a home, to those looking for a job, and to those

wishing to invest. This road was about people, it was about their futures, their opportunities

for employment and education, as well as connection. The Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road

was going to deliver a major aspect of Limerick Regeneration and, in doing so, help in the

rejuvenation of the entire Region. He called on Minister Ryan to immediately sign the

Commencement Order to allow the road – in full – to proceed.

The Chief Executive then addressed the Meeting and made the Members aware that the

Executive had met with Minister Ryan during the week and would be meeting with Minister

Ryan again in the coming days on the Coonagh Knockalisheen issue. He said the matter was

not about whether there was a road or a light rail solution for the North of Limerick City, but

that it was about delivering on a project contained in the National Development Plan - the

Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road. He said it was possible to both complete the road as per the

planning permission and also, later, add light-rail and improve public transport in the

northside of the city. The Chief Executive gave his and the Executive’s full support on the

issue of having the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road commence and be completed.

There was unanimous support from the Members for the Motion put forward to the Special

Meeting. The Members then spoke in turn and the following points were made by them in

the ensuing discussion:

 The Council was in near total support for the construction of the Coonagh to

Knockalisheen Road, in its entirety.

 The community that the construction most affected was in support of building this

road.

 Civic Leaders, including the Limerick Chamber, were in support of the completion of

this project.

 Limerick Institute of Technology was in support of the road being completed.

 The project was not a new project; it was listed in the sign-off in the National

Development Plan 2018-2027 and the Programme for Government. €17 million had

already been spent on the project.

 The Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road was about putting in place the infrastructure for

proper economic development on the northside of Limerick. The project, when

delivered as planned, would attract investment into the area and, by extension,

employment.

 Regeneration plans envisaged the construction of the Northern Distributor Road and

it was a crucial project in terms of removing the physical isolation and exclusion that

Moyross/North Limerick City had faced. The reason the road was initiated in the first

instance was to fulfill the Regeneration Plan for Moyross. The Fitzgerald Report in

2007 stated: “*Experience with other regeneration projects has shown that a key*

*element in developing economic activity, and ending the isolation of deprived areas, is*

*through putting in place a sound ro**ads and transport infrastructure.”*

 The road needed to commence and be completed to deliver the promised connectivity

for all of the northside, and many people across numerous neighbourhoods had

participated in years of public consultation about the road.

 Moyross was a large cul-de-sac, and the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road would

improve access in and out of Moyross and open it up to the wider area.

 The proposal to partially construct the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road was rejected

by An Bord Pleanála at the planning stage.

 Regeneration was based on three pillars: Physical Development; Social Development;

Economic Development. Progress had been made in terms of the social and physical

aspect, but the economic side was yet to be achieved. The Coonagh to Knockalisheen

Road (in its entirety) would be the foundation for economic enhancement.

 Offering half the road, or two-thirds, was not acceptable. Offering rail as ‘either/or’

was also not acceptable. The northside of Limerick needed and deserved both the

Northern Distributor Road and enhanced public transport/a light rail system.

 There were issues with the proposed shortened road scheme and there were factors

which needed to be considered to complete the full project as per the National

Development Plan:

o It would bring extra traffic through the centre of Moyross as this would then be the

main link between Longpavement and Coonagh. Progressing the overall road

scheme and upgrading the Knockalisheen Road would avoid this and allow for

significant traffic calming within Moyross;

o There were significant HGV movements on the Knockalisheen Road and the

Longpavement Road coming from quarries in Clare and some of these could divert

through Moyross if the road scheme were not built in full;

o The overall Scheme included for approx. 5km of new Cycle and Walking paths along

its full length providing not just a sustainable cycling/walking route, but also a very

important recreational walking/jogging/cycling route for people trying to get fit and

stay fit. Linking this to Condell Road provided an overall connected length of

approx. 10km of Recreational paths on the northside;

o The overall road scheme provided footpath and cyclepath linkages to the Direct

Provision Centre in Knockalisheen allowing residents to access schools, LIT and

Tesco at Coonagh Cross;

o The section of the existing Knockalisheen Road just after Castlepark out to the Clare

boundary was low lying, poorly constructed and liable to flooding in Winter and

would be raised and upgraded as part of the road scheme, removing a dangerous

section of road;

o The upgrade of Knockalisheen Road from Watchhouse Cross out to Castlepark

would provide a new upgraded road and entrance at the main existing Moyross

entrance and Watchhouse Cross junction, allowing for significant safety,

environmental, public realm and landscaping improvements, improving the overall

impression and look of the area on entering Moyross. This would also provide

decent footpaths and cyclepaths in front of the houses along Knockalisheen Road

and upgrade the non-existent footpaths and cyclepaths going over the rail bridge,

improving safety for children, cyclists and walkers using this section of the road to

access schools and work.

o The land between Coonagh and Cratloe Road was liable to flooding and not

generally suitable to developing industry/offices. The better development land was

located between Cratloe Road and Knockalisheen Road and therefore building this

part of the road would allow for greater overall economic benefit to the area in

terms of developing a future Business Park on the northside of the city, creating

much-needed jobs and employment;

o To obtain the widest economic benefit from the road scheme, the entire road - as

given planning permission by An Bord Pleanála - needed to be constructed. The cost

benefit of the road was calculated at planning stage. The economic cost to benefit

rate of return for the overall scheme was in excess of three if the scheme were built

in its entirety, meaning that for every €1 spent in construction, the economy would

benefit by more than €3 in relation to the wider environmental, economic and

social benefits.

 Rail investment was envisaged by Planners when designing the road as the plans

contained a provision to widen two bridges to facilitate twin-track development

within the road scheme.

 It was questioned that should the proposed alternative road project commence,

would the development still be in accordance with the permission granted and, if not,

if it was an unauthorised development, could it be injuncted. By extension, it was

asked if the project needed to restart with a fresh application – after 14 years of

consultation.

 Journey time from the Plassey Technology and Business Park to Shannon Airport could

be halved by the full completion of the Northern Distributor Road.

The Green Party Members made the following points:

 The people of Moyross needed a road and needed connectivity to Coonagh and the

city and much more.

 Residents of Moyross and neighbouring communities also needed proper connectivity

with each other and direct, safe access to the existing LIT campus, shops, schools,

sports clubs and other facilities.

 The high number of people in Moyross who were travelling by sustainable modes such

as public transport, walking and cycling needed to be facilitated. They needed quick

and direct access to the city and the facilities that existed on the other side of the city.

 Limerick’s expansion into the suburbs and adjacent counties over the last 50 years had

hollowed out the city and if the expansion continued, it would make the situation

worse. The city needed to be developed if Limerick wanted a vibrant city centre.

Limerick was planned to grow to 200,000 people. Excellent public transport, walking

and cycling routes into the city were required in order to create vibrant and liveable

communities.

 Finally, they did not believe the *Programme for Government* precluded some

rethinking of the current plan but would welcome an opportunity for the Council to

meet the Minister to discuss the road and would support the Motion calling for a

meeting with the Minister.

In response to the comments about Regeneration efforts in Moyross, the Director of Housing

Development commended the communities in Regeneration areas and pointed out that the

Council was in Year 7 of a 10-Year Regeneration Plan, that the Council had delivered on many

physical infrastructure and community centre projects and that there was much more to do.

She also pointed out the Council had received very positive feedback from the communities

in Regeneration areas about Regeneration initiatives that had been completed.

An amendment to the original Motion was proposed by Councillor O’ Hanlon, and seconded

by Councillor J. Sheahan. The amended Motion read as follows:

**“That, (a) Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister for Transport,**

**Mr. Eamon Ryan, TD, to meet with this Council as a matter of urgency to discuss**

**the Coonagh Knockalisheen Road; (b) this Council call on the Transport Minister to sign the**

**necessary documentation to allow for the completion of the Coonagh Knockailsheen Road,**

**as already agreed, and which is included in the Programme for Government, without any**

**further delay or any changes or modifications.”**

An amendment to the amended Motion was then proposed by Councillor Leddin, and

seconded by Councillor C. Sheehan. The amended Motion read as follows:

**“That, (a) Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister for Transport,**

**Mr. Eamon Ryan, TD, to meet with this Council as a matter of urgency to discuss**

**the Coonagh Knockalisheen Road; (b) this Council call on the Transport Minister to sign the**

**necessary documentation to allow for the completion of the Coonagh Knockailsheen Road,**

**as already agreed, and which is included in the Programme for Government, without any**

**further delay or any changes or modifications; and (c) Limerick City and County Council**

**request a meeting with An Taoiseach to seek his support and commitment for the delivery**

**of the Northern Distributor Road as originally approved by Statutory Agencies.”**

It was then asked if all parties agreed with the proposed Amendment. The Green Party

Members stated that while they agreed to the initial Motion to meet Minister Ryan to discuss

the matter, they could not support the second part of the Motion to give Direction to the

Minister for Transport.

A vote was then taken on the amended Motion as proposed by Councillor Leddin and

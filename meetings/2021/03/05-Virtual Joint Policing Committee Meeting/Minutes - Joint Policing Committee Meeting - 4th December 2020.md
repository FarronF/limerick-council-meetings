**1.Minutes**

Circulated, copy of Minutes of Joint Policing Committee Meeting held on 2nd October, 2020 :

Proposed by Councillor M. Ryan

Seconded by Councillor S. Keary

**2.Update from Chief Superintendent**

The Chief Superintendent stated that Covid 19 still remains a high risk issue in Limerick despite the

restrictions. Also, despite a reduction in the volume of traffic, drug and drink driving detection is still

very high. Since Covid Gardaí have more time to give on thorough investigations and has been very

successful this year on drug detection with a lot of cases before the courts. He added that court

cases are back logged for months despite seven court sittings in Limerick most of the time. He

stated that a lot of the crime has been pushed out the county because a lot of people are now

working from home in the city which has resulted in reduced house burglaries in the city.

**3.Overview on Crime Statistics from Senior Analyst**

Ms. L. Collins gave a brief statistical overview of current crime statistics.
---
The Chief Superintendent stated that the Gardaí in Limerick launched an initiative a few years ago in

relation to domestic violence. Procedures are in place nationally, however, this initiative is the only

one in Ireland. Gardaí in plain clothes meet abuse victims in a safe place away from Garda stations

in a confidential manner and every effort is made to encourage abuse victims to lodge a complaint

against their abuser. The Gardaí work closely with Tusla and Adapt House. He said it will be

monitored over the next three years and expressed hope that it opens pathways and give all

relevant information to people who needs it. He added that there has been a huge increase in

domestic violence since the commencement of Covid 19 pandemic.

He stated that Adapt contacts the Gardaí when necessary. The Gardaí monitor the more serious

domestic violence cases and said the most effective thing is to bring these cases before the courts.

He said the Gardaí encourage people to engage with the Services, however, most are living in fear.

Alot of the court services are particularly backed up at present and special courts are being

convened to deal with this back log. He added that additional Garda resources are needed to deal

with these cases. He pointed out that the backing up of trials can have legal implications which is

worrying, however, there is a procedure in place to monitor those people on bail and extremely

serious cases are prioritized.

Members welcomed this initiative and commended all involved. They particularly welcomed the

fact that Gardaí follow up with victims of domestic abuse to encourage them to proceed with

prosecution and to seek help. However, he stated that more awareness is required.

The Chief Superintendent replied to Members queries as follows :

The extra testing machines account for the increase in drug detections adding that there are now

seven drug testing machines in Limerick. If additional machines are required they can be applied for.

A lot of people are trained in the use of these machines including traffic corps. He pointed out that

drugs can remain in your system for up to two weeks and drug detection can result in serious

implications. He stated that 205 drug dealers have been arrested, however, a lot of cases are

awaiting trial so dealers are back out on the streets. He commended the drugs squad adding that

additional resources will be sought.

The issue of sulky racing is a continuing problem with people attending and participating in sulky

racing from all over the country. However, resources are a constant issue but the Gardaí manage

the situation as best as possible. Control of horses in the metropolitan area is an ongoing problem

and in particular horses which were recently in Mt. St. Oliver graveyard. He said he would support

strong legislation and fully support the Council in addressing this issue. However, there is a

significant cost to remove horses and then in most cases the horses are never claimed. The welfare

of horses is also an issue.

**4.Question submitted by Niall Collins, T.D.**

*“I will ask at the next Meeting for confirmation that a dedicated Policing Plan for Rathkeale will be*

*implemented during the Christmas and New Year period and if a broad outline of this plan can be*

*made available to inform the public”.*

Superintendent Magner stated that last year the Plan for the Christmas and New Year period was in

operation from 6th December 2019 to 5th January, 2020. This year it has been extended and covers

the period 24th November, 2020 to 10th January, 2021 which is an increase of two weeks. An

additional budget was applied for and granted. The Gardai have an extensive engagement with key

stakeholders in Rathkeale and the main aim is to identify any breach of legislation. Loitering on the
---
street is an issue so Gardai are on the streets to address this problem and are also targeting illegal

parking. There has been a significant increase in the number of people coming into Rathkeale for

the Christmas period, however, there is a high visibility of Gardaí in the town and increased

checkpoints. There are also additional personnel from the Garda training centre and support from

divisional roads policing personnel. She stated that she could not disclose the operational order for

operational reasons.

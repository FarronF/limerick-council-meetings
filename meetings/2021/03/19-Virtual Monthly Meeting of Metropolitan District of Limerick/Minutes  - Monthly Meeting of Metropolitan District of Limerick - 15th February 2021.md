Nelsons Cross junction over the past 10 years. Along the R525 Regional road, this junction

exists along a straight section of road within a 60kmph speed limit zone. There are three

properties located at the junction, which limit the scope for the realignment of the junction.

There is a driver feedback sign on the R525 O’Brien bridge approach to the junction and

Limerick City and County Council will place a further driver feedback sign on the Daly’s cross

approach.

There is an ESB pole, which is creating sightline issues as a motorist approaches the junction

from the village. This pole is currently under consideration by ESB networks for relocation.

This will require extensive changes to the ESB networks in the area with civils ducting and

cabling also required. The ESB to date have not committed to a date to complete the works

but this work is outstanding for the past 2 years. Note Limerick City and County Council

Strategic Policy Committee.

Transport Authority (NTA).

**17.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery (to be referred to the Local Electoral**

**Area Briefings)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with Bus Eireann and the NTA to provide Glasgow Park and Flanker Court***

***with a bus service.***

It was proposed by Councillor Slattery, seconded by Councillor Daly and agreed to allow this Notice

of Motion to be taken at the meeting.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Slattery highlighted the importance of providing a bus service

for Glasgow Park and Flanker Court, particularly as elderly people and residents in the area had to

walk a considerable distance to a bus stop. She also highlighted that this issue had been raised on

numerous occasions in the past.

The Members referred to issues in relation to areas where bus services were not being provided,

and the possible use of smaller buses to support link services for certain areas. The Members also

agreed that decisions in relation to Limerick City bus services were being made at a national, rather

than local level, and without any engagement, which was also frustrating.

It was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and agreed to amend

the Notice of Motion as follows:

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council engage with Bus Eireann and the NTA to provide Glasgow Park and Flanker Court***
---

***with a bus service and invite a representative of Bus Eireann and the NTA to attend a Meeting***

***with the Members of the Metropolitan District of Limerick to discuss bus issues and bus routes in***

***the Metropolitan District area.***

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council***

***commends the Scottish Government in making available period products free of charge in their***

***schools, educational institutions, and public buildings, and that having regard to the Period***

***Products (Free Provision) Bill 2021 currently going through the Oireachtas, that the Metropolitan***

***District asks the Chief Executive to conduct a pilot project to assess how this would work in***

***Limerick City and County Council and report back to the Council by September 2021 on how such***

***a scheme could operate.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas highlighted the importance of making period products

available in public buildings, schools and in particular for young people.

**REPLY**:

It is noted that the issue of the provision of free sanitary products in public buildings

is the subject of the Bill as referenced. The Council will await the adoption of the law

and the provisions and implications of same to be notified to Local Authorities in

due course and will advise Elected Members accordingly. The Council will proceed

with implementing the outcome of this process upon its completion at national

level.

**19.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas (to be referred to the Climate Action,**

**Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council establishes and provides a tree planting grant for community and voluntary***

***groups similar to the Maintenance of Open Spaces Grant.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment

Strategic Policy Committee.

**20.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council extend event casual trading licences during Covid restrictions to facilitate rate***

***paying businesses to operate outdoor trade in specified areas.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan.

**REPLY**: The Casual Trading legislation was introduced for the control and regulation of casual

trading. At its core, it is a regulatory function of local authorities.

Casual Trading is regulated by the Casual Trading Act 1995, as amended, together with

Limerick City and County Council’s Casual Trading Byelaws. It is an offence under this Act to
---

trade without a valid casual trading licence.  Casual Trading is divided into Designated Area

trading and Special Event trading.

A Special Event Licence is granted only for the duration of the event taking place (such as a

sports event). A Casual Trading Special Event Licence cannot be extended.

As there are no events taking place currently due to Covid 19 restrictions there are no casual

trading special event licences being issued.

Additionally, the proposal to extend casual trading licences to rate paying businesses only,

is not provided for in the law, could be both illegal and discriminatory and would likely be

subject to challenge under competition law.

The current Covid advice recommends strongly against unnecessary gatherings, which this

proposal could inadvertently facilitate.

The Elected Members noted that the current Casual Trading Bye-Laws were in place for a number

of years and certain aspects of trading may have changed due to Covid 19 outbreak. They agreed

that it was important to safeguard existing ratepayers and businesses.

Councillor O’Donovan then withdrew her Motion.

**21.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir (to be referred to the Travel**

**and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council develop and deliver a communication/education campaign about safe and***

***appropriate parking practices, with a focus on the dangers of parking on footpaths, cycle lanes***

***and bus stops.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy

Committee.

**22.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council launch a public awareness campaign to deal with the issue of increased illegal***

***dumping and littering during the Covid 19 lockdown.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) highlighted the issue of increased littering across

the city.

Members supported the motion and referenced the issue of increased litter, particularly around

the Three Bridges walk in the City Centre, as this was much busier at the present time. They also

noted the increased amount of dog fouling.

The Members also commended the voluntary work being done by some individuals and groups

who were going out to pick up litter in their areas. It was agreed that a letter of thanks from the

Elected Members would issue to individuals involved in general clean ups and litter picking, to

acknowledge their voluntary efforts in trying to keep their areas clean and litter free. Members

agreed to submit the details of any individuals to the Meetings Administrator who would arrange

to write to them.

The Director, Service Operations noted the request to focus the Litter Wardens attention on the

areas referred to and he agreed to re-circulate the report on Litter Management Plan to the

Members.

**REPLY**: In addition to the current anti-litter campaign, it is the intention of Limerick City and County

Council to roll out a suite of anti-dumping campaign materials that has been created and

tailored specifically for each Local Authority by MyWaste.ie. Materials include press

adverts for local press, posters, social media assets, static posts and GIFs, animation, flyer,

etc. The Council will also continue with initiatives that encourage good behaviour in

relation to litter such as Green Schools Programme, supporting Tidy Towns groups, Team

Limerick Clean Up, National Spring Clean and other anti-litter initiatives.

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council rejects the move by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to***

***strip Councillors of powers to veto the sale of public land through the proposed Land***

***Development Agency Bill.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor Benson and agreed.

It was proposed by Councillor Butler to amend the motion, seconded by Cllr M. Sheahan and

agreed.

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council rejects the move by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to***

***strip Councillors of powers to veto the sale of public land through the proposed Land***

***Development Agency Bill and that the Members of the Metropolitan District write to the Minister***

***for Housing, Planning and Local Government advising him of this.***

The Members expressed concern at the contents of the Land Development Agency Bill that was

currently before the Oireachtas. These concerns related particularly to possible changes to the

disposal of public land, which would affect the input of local Elected Members, which was always

a reserved function of the Members. While it was noted that this was a draft Bill at the current

time and consequently subject to further changes and amendments, the Members agreed it would

be a further undermining of the powers of local authorities, which was disappointing.

**24.**

**Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

**25.** **Condolences**

The Members extended their condolences and sympathy to the family of Emer Williams, daughter

of former Cllr Cormac Hurley, Caherdavin who had passed away recently, and they extended their

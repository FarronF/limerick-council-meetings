October 2019, LDA in partnership with Limerick City and County Council, CIE and the HSE announced

plans to examine the potential for development of a 50 hectare site in Limerick City Centre near

Colbert Station. A Design Team was established, led by the Royal Institute of Architects (RIAI) to

undertake a Design Review for the Colbert Station Quarter to identify five high level design ideas and

concepts that could be considered for future development.

Following public consultation on the Draft Design Review over 100 submissions were received,

which outlined the importance of integration of new and existing communities, a mix of

accommodation for all ages and inclusion of retail and office space to encourage job creation and

facilities to encourage arts, culture and sporting activities.

A number of stakeholder meetings took place and feedback from these will inform the next stage of

the project, which will be the creation of a Spatial Framework, which will include key objectives for

the future development of Limerick Colbert Station Quarter and will feed into the new

Development Plan 2022-2028.

A new website Colbert Station Quarter.ie has also been created, where public can access up-to-date

information on the project.

Further engagement and public consultation will take place during January/February 2021 to

ensure that plans being proposed for the site will be deliverable in the short / long-term.

While members thanked the LDA for the presentation, they queried who was funding the project

and were informed that the LDA is funding the current study to assist with the master planning of

the site.

Members also queried plans for the Foynes Line and were informed that Iarnód Éireann had plans

for reinstatement of the Line in the future.

It was agreed to circulate a copy of the LDA presentation to members.

**Item 3**

**Overview of the CE Report on the pre-draft public consultation stage for the proposed Limerick**

**Development Plan 2022-2028**

M. Woods, A/Senior Planner gave an overview of the CE Report on the pre-draft public consultation

stage for the proposed Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028. She stated that

 38 Meetings took place with key stakeholders

 5 public meetings were held in each Municipal District in September

 Over 30 face to face meetings were held

 229 valid submissions were received following public consultation from 15/8 – 12/10/2020

The key recommendations from the above meetings were outlined and a CE Report was prepared on

the submissions received during the pre-draft consultation process.

Maria also outlined the schedule of works for the next number of months, which includes holding

workshops with elected members and preparation of the Draft Development Plan by Feb/March

2021.

Members thanked Maria for the concise presentation and raised queries regarding density criteria,

one-off rural housing and renewal of towns and villages.

She stated that densities varied according to location and that An Bord Pleanála required high level

densities in the city centre with low levels more viable in rural areas.

Regarding Irish Water’s Town & Village Renewal Initiative, she stated that €6.6m had been allocated

under the Scheme and that some towns required larger investments than others and she was hopeful

that a number of towns would benefit under the Scheme.

Maria stated that the NPF and RSES sets out the main guidelines in relation to rural housing.

She stated that a workshop would be organised for elected members to discuss rural housing,

development of towns and villages and the promotion of use of serviced sites.

It was confirmed that a list of protected structures in each of the Municipal Areas had been circulated

to Elected Members and that an updated list would be circulated to the Sectoral Interests and PPN

representatives.

She confirmed that a workshop on protected structures would be organised with members of the

SPC early in the New Year.

Replying to B. Thompson, Maria confirmed that she would organise a briefing session with the PPN

Linkage Group to discuss the criteria for selecting protected structures.

V. Murray informed members that a Working Group will be put in place in the New Year to review

the list of Protected Structures.

Maria assured members that no constraints will be applied to the development of Foynes Port once

it complied with the Renewable Energy Strategy.

Following concerns raised by members regarding the issuing of Derelict Site Notices, the Chairperson

agreed to invite Gordon Daly, Director of Community & Enterprise to the next SPC meeting to discuss

this matter.

It was agreed to circulate a copy of the Forward Planning presentation to members.

***Rosie Webb.***

As this item had been deferred at two previous meetings of the Committee, it was decided to proceed

with the presentation.

Shannon. She stated that the Design Enabling Review was carried out to examine options for the

Riverway Project and to make recommendations for appropriate infrastructural provisions to

City and to address the impacts of the recommendations of the CFRAM Study.

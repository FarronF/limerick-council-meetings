(including Adare Bypass) projects.

8. Amend Objective TM O12 as follows:

traffic congestion, pollution and inactive lifestyles.

12. Amend Objective TM O21 as follows:

Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir outlined her reasons for these proposed amendments which

included:

 There are many references to the draft Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport

Strategy and some objectives proposed based on them being in the Draft LSMATS. The Draft

LSMATS however is only a draft and we should only follow a strategy if it is an adopted

strategy. Action: Remove Draft LSMATS references and use references to the existing

strategies, such as NPF, NDP and RSES, or rephrase.

 On a similar principle to removing the reference to Draft in relation to LSMATS, she

suggested that the amendment proposed by the TII to insert M20 Cork to Limerick Scheme

into the objectives TM 011 and TM012 be further amended. The project is currently in the

option selection phase and it would be premature to call it the M20 scheme. She suggested

amending it to N/M20 Cork to Limerick Scheme as this is the current name of the scheme

and all outcomes are still possible. Further action: Replacing M20 Cork to Limerick scheme

with N/M20 Cork to Limerick scheme throughout the document.

 To make all TMOs compliant with sustainable development principles already enshrined in

the regional and national strategies, put the welfare of people and sustainable safety at the
---

centre of all transport planning and traffic management and above convenience of motor

traffic. Create an environment where less people need to drive and those who do can do so

safely and fluidly

**Planning Authority Response:**

A number of the proposed Amendments are in line with the submission received from the National

Transport Authority, which was received outside the statutory consultation period. The remainder

of the proposed Amendments are in support of sustainable transport in the Southern Environs.

Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir also proposed the following changes to:

Chapter 14: Climate Change & Flood Management:

 Amend Objective CC O2 as follows:

Pursue modal shift to sustainable transport modes as the highest transport priority of the

Council and support sustainable travel, energy efficient projects, green infrastructure and

sustainable residential development projects.

 Include Objective CC O10 as follows:

Decisions around transport planning and operations (including traffic management) will be

aligned with the government’s policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50%

by 2030, its Climate Action Plan and the Paris Agreement objective to achieve net zero

greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir outlined her reasons for these proposed amendments including:

Discussions about climate change must also consider issues around agriculture and transport and

while the local authority has limited influence when it comes to agricultural issues, it has influence

when it comes to transport planning, operations and traffic management.

The section on Climate Change should adequately address transport as the local authority plays a

role in planning and management of transport, which is a sector that accounts for 40% of Ireland’s

energy-related GHG emissions. (See RSES, p132).

**Planning Authority Response:**

The proposed Amendments are acceptable, in the interest of achieving sustainable transport for

the Southern Environs of Limerick and in line with national policy.

The Amendments outlined above were proposed by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir and seconded

by Councillor Secas.

Councillor Leddin proposed the following amendment:

**1.Amend Chapter 11: Transport & Movement**

Include Objective TM 024 as follows:

Explore improved accessibility to Limerick Southside, including the possible provision of a

motorway interchange connection from the M20/M7 to Limerick Southside.
---

Cllr Leddin outlined his reason for this proposed amendment, stating that it was in the interest of

providing adequate access, and to facilitate the enhancement of permeability in areas in need of

regeneration in the area.

**Planning Authority Response:**

The Planning Authority have discussed the proposed link with Transport Infrastructure Ireland and

the National Transport Authority, in the consultation phase for the preparation of the proposed

Limerick Development Plan and concerns have been raised by both organisations in relation to the

proposal. The issue should be considered in the context of the overall development of Limerick City

and Environs in the proposed Limerick Development Plan. However, the Local Authority will explore

improved accessibility to the Southside of Limerick City in consultation with the relevant

stakeholders.

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Conor Sheehan.

2. Councillor Leddin also proposed an amendment, which is outlined as follows:

To amend the zoning matrix for Health Clinic/Health Practitioner Clinic from “Open to

Consideration” to generally permitted in the Enterprise and Employment zoning.

Cllr Leddin outlined his reason for this proposed amendment, stating it was to support the

development of a health clinic / health practitioner clinic on Enterprise and Employment lands.

**Planning Authority Response:**

The Planning Authority are not supportive of the proposed amendment; health clinic/health

practitioner clinic should be located in appropriate locations such as Local and District Centres and

not on lands zoned for Enterprise and Employment.

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Daly.

Some Elected Members opposed the proposed amendment on the basis that they considered the

Planning Authorities advice appropriate, and that there were also vacant units available in the

District and Local Centres that could be utilised.

A vote then took place to determine whether the proposed amendment should be included:

**In favour of the proposed amendment:**

Councillors Butler, Daly, Kiely, Kilcoyne, Leddin, McSweeney, Murphy, O’Donovan, O’Hanlon,

O’Sullivan, Secas, Sheahan (M) and Sheehan (C).

(13)

**Against the proposed amendment:**

Councillors Benson, Collins, Hartigan, Novak Uí Chonchúir, O’Dea, Slattery and Talukder.

(7)

The vote was 13 no. in favour of the proposed amendment and 7 no. against the proposed

amendment. The proposed amendment shall be included as a material amendment to the

proposed public display documents.

**3.Councillor Leddin also proposed an amendment, which is outlined as follows:**

-

Amend Land Use Zoning Map

To rezone as per Submission Number 17 in the name of Dr. Eamon Bowles at Number 1, Dooradoyle

Road from existing residential to enterprise and employment.

Cllr Leddin outlined his reason for this proposed amendment as this house has not been used for

residential purposes in over 16 years, and the rezoning will facilitate a return to use under a

rezoning to enterprise and employment, which will facilitate new employment and much need

health services.

**Planning Authority Response:**

The Planning Authority are not supportive of the proposed amendment; the proposed use would

be more appropriately located in a District or Local Centre, many of which currently have vacant

units within them. The proposed location is also considered unsuitable from a road safety

perspective.

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne.

Some Elected Members opposed the proposed amendment and outlined that there are available

vacant units in the District and Local Centres. It was also queried as to why the dwelling had been

vacant for so long.

A vote took place to determine whether the proposed amendment should be included.

**In favour of the Proposed Amendment:**

Councillors Butler, Daly, Kiely, Kilcoyne, Leddin, Murphy, O’Hanlon, O’Sullivan, Secas, Sheahan (M)

and Sheehan (C).

(11)

**Against the Proposed Amendment:**

Councillors Collins, Hartigan, Novak Uí Chonchúir, O’Dea, O’Donovan, Slattery and Talukder.

(7)

**Abstention:**

Councillor McSweeney.

(1)

The vote was 11 no. in favour of the proposed amendment and 7 no. against the proposed

amendment. The proposed amendment shall be included as a material amendment to the

proposed public display documents.

**4.Councillor Leddin also proposed an amendment, which is outlined as follows:**

-

Amend Land Use Zoning Map

To rezone lands located at Rosbrien and in the ownership of Shannon Group comprising of
---
7

approximately 20 hectares from agriculture to enterprise and employment.

Cllr Leddin outlined his reason for this proposed amendment outlining that the Southern Environs

Local Area Plan 2021 – 2027 has set up ambitious employment targets over the next several years.

These objectives of creating an additional 20,000 jobs if achieved require the provision of suitable

zoned lands adjacent to road and rail to attract future commercial investment. Limerick is

competing both nationally and internationally to attract new industries and jobs into our city and

the zoning of these lands will assist in delivering this growth. The lands are adjacent to the

motorway and are a prime location, if development is to be accommodated in Limerick.

**Planning Authority Response:**

The Planning Authority are not supportive of the proposed amendment in light of the concerns

raised in the submissions received from the Office of the Planning Regulator, Transport

Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority. The lands are located within the NM20

Limerick to Cork Scheme constraints area and the lands and concerns were raised in relation to the

potential impact of traffic on the junction with the motorway.

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor Kilcoyne.

Some Elected Members raised concerns with regard to the proposal, with the potential to impact

on road schemes and whether this will compromise the development of the N/M20 Cork to

Limerick Road Scheme. Concerns were also raised with regard to the amount of lands zoned for

Enterprise and Employment in the Plan and the potential conflict of policies within the plan. The

Members also thought it was not advisable to go against planning, TII and NTA advice.

A vote took place to determine whether the proposed amendment should be included.

**In favour of the Proposed Amendment:**

Councillors Kilcoyne, Leddin, Secas and Sheehan (C).

(4)

**Against the Proposed Amendment:**

Councillors Butler, Collins, Daly, Hartigan, Kiely, McSweeney, Murphy, Novak Uí Chonchúir, O’Dea,

O’Donovan, O’Hanlon, O’Sullivan, Sheahan (M), Slattery and Talukder.

(15)

The vote was 4 no. in favour of the proposed amendment and 15 no. against the proposed

amendment. The proposed amendment shall not be included as a material amendment to the

proposed public display documents.

**5.Councillor Leddin also proposed an amendment, which is outlined as follows:**

Amend Transport Map

Amend Transport Map to include a new link road connecting the Dooradoyle Road and the

Rosbrien Road, which had been included in the 2011 – 2017 Local Area Plan (as extended).

Cllr Leddin outlined his reason for this proposed amendment outlining that the provision of a link
---
8

road will facilitate the future growth of this area in terms of both residential and enterprise

development. There is a significant land bank located in the Dooradoyle area adjacent to the

Crescent Shopping Centre that subject to flood assessment reports will offer an opportunity to

further develop this area within the Southern Environs in a sustainable manner for the benefit of

the wider community and city of Limerick.

**Planning Authority Response:**

The Planning Authority consider that the proposed link is unwarranted, having regard to the nature

of the land zoned in the vicinity of the proposed road, the National Planning Framework sets out

that only infrastructure that can be delivered within the lifetime of the proposed Plan, should be

identified and included. It is not envisaged that the proposed link will be delivered within the

lifetime of the Plan.

The Amendment was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor O’Donovan.

Some Elected Members raised concerns for the need for the proposed route, the potential for

connection with the Rosbrien Road and the impact on residential properties on Greenfields

Road/Rosbrien Road. Some Members noted that it was also contrary to national and regional policy

and to SDG’s and to policies to achieve modal shift and the need to move away from enabling traffic

movements.

A vote took place to determine whether the proposed amendment should be included.

**In favour of the Proposed Amendment:**

Councillors Butler, Daly, Kiely, Kilcoyne, Leddin, McSweeney, O’Donovan, O’Hanlon, O’Sullivan,

Secas, Sheahan (M) and Sheehan (C).

(12)

**Against the Proposed Amendment:**

Councillors Collins, Hartigan, Novak Uí Chonchúir, O’Dea, Slattery and Talukder.

(6)

The vote was 12 no. in favour of the proposed amendment and 6 no. against the proposed

amendment. The proposed amendment shall be included as a material amendment to the

proposed public display documents.

The Acting Senior Planner explained that the Material Alterations would be prepared and placed

on public display for 4 weeks; a second Chief Executive’s Report would then be prepared and will

be presented to the Elected Members to make the plan. The Acting Senior Planner thanked the

Elected Members for their input into the plan to date.

This concluded the Meeting.

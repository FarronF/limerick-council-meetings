Following the signing of this Order, the Metropolitan District incorporated this change into their

Metropolitan District Standing Orders at the November 2020 Metropolitan District Meeting.

The Cathaoirleach confirmed that all decisions or votes, therefore, taken by Elected Members at

such meetings (whether physically or remotely present) have the same status in law as decisions

business, while also protecting the health and safety of Elected Members and local authority staff.

***July/August 2020.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council placed a counter on S.C.R. near Mary I campus in order to

count pedestrians and cyclists during the traffic restriction measures implemented during

Summer 2020. Attached find daily figures of pedestrians/cyclists recorded during this time.

The Council is now actively progressing a permanent proposal to enhance active travel

measures along South Circular Road and the data recorded during the Covid-19 summer

restrictions forms an important input into the development of the future proposals on this

road.

The data figures will be evaluated by the appointed consultants working on the project and

will inform the decision-making process. Feedback from the numerous submissions made

by residents/road users during the summer restricted traffic period will be assessed in

formulating decisions relating to the future active travel measures to be implemented. A

formal consultation process will follow in order to ensure the best final solution will be put

**7.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the locked Sarsfield House and Sylvester O’Halloran***

***Bridge gates and if there has been any advancement by Limerick Council on the permanent***

***opening of these gates.***

**REPLY:** Neither of these gates is under the control of the Council. The matter of their opening hours

is an issue for owners of the property on which they are located in the first instance.

The gates are open for long periods during the working day and for quite a number of hours

at the weekend. However, for valid security reasons they are closed at other times and

cannot be opened permanently. This traversing pathway has to be managed by the

respective owners and the Council must respect their wishes to manage their property as

they see fit. The alternative route across Matthew Bridge is but a brief diversion.---

**8.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next meeting what percentage of the new housing stock for 2021 will the Council***

***allocate to the various housing bodies.***

**REPLY**: Housing Support Services utilise the social care expertise of the Approved Housing Body

Sector for dealing with a variety of housing allocations, this is executed on a license basis

with AHB. All of these arrangements are reviewed in Case Management Meetings to assess

the levels of support required. AHB manage their own stock and new stock are allocated

via the Housing Support Services Team with Qualified Housing Applicants.

Housing Support Services do not aim or set targets in terms of a percentage to allocate to

Approved Housing Bodies. The process is customer led in terms of a determination during

the assessment for housing process.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next meeting how much funding has the Council spent in total on hotel***

***accommodation relating to homeless services provision in 2019 up to year ending 2020.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council has spent the following funding on hotel accommodation

relating to homeless services provision:

2019 €1.5m

2020 €1.9m

To provide a level of the figures, during 2019 the Department of Social Protection paid for

some B&B costs to the Council during that year. The monthly figure in relation to family

homelessness and the Homeless Action Team, with the support of housing allocations, aim

to have no families in hotels by the end of Q1 2021.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask the Council to list what roads will be included in the Winter plan in terms of the gritting***

***process during the severe icy spells that are forecasted.***

**REPLY**: I refer to the above Question regarding the Winter Maintenance Programme 2020 / 2021

and will comment as follows, referring specifically to the severe weather experienced for

the two-week period in late December / early January.

During this period, the nighttime temperatures dropped to between to -4 degrees and for

a few days, the temperatures in the shade remained close to zero during the day.

The Winter Maintenance Plan adopted includes all the main distributary roads around the

city. During the severe weather period, additional roads were included notably;

Summerville Road, Courtbrack Avenue, Rhebogue Road, Greenhills Road (due to the

relocation of the fire service as result of Covid 19 restrictions) and the area around the

Market at weekend. In the compilation of the Winter Maintenance Programme 2021/2022,

other routes may be considered in severe weather conditions.---

**11.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Metropolitan Meeting for a full and detailed explanation as to what occurred***

***between Limerick City and County Council and P&D Lydon Plant Hire Limited in relation to the***

***Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road, from when the contract was awarded, to when P&D Lydon Plant***

***Hire Limited ceased work on the project, all activity that followed leading to a High Court case,***

***and why Councillors were not informed of the situation prior to reading it in a national***

***newspaper on January 7th 2021.***

**REPLY**: P&D Lydon Plant Hire Ltd were appointed by Limerick City and County Council on 23rd June

2017 to carry out an Advance Works contract on the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Distributor

Road Scheme. The project involved the construction of 300 metres of urban dual

carriageway from Coonagh Roundabout to the rear of Coonagh Cross Shopping Centre and

embankment construction for a further 650 meters of future dual carriageway towards the

Old Cratloe Road. The works commenced on 14th August 2017 and they were substantially

completed on 8th November 2018.  An adjoining landowner challenged the validity of a

waste permit for the disposal of inert soil from the construction of the road. The High Court

issued its judgement in December 2020 and the Council is now considering that judgement

with its legal advisors.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**12.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next meeting, that this Council extend the deadline for the bin waiver scheme,***

***due to applicants having difficulty obtaining supporting documentation under level 5***

***restrictions.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Benson outlined the difficulties that applicants had obtaining

documentation. She acknowledged the work carried out by Council Officials.

**REPLY**: As the country is currently at Level 5 of Covid 19 restrictions, a decision has been taken to

extend the closing date for applications to the Bin Waiver Scheme 2021 by two weeks.

The extended deadline for return of forms is now Monday, February 15th, 2021.

Bin Waiver Application forms were distributed the first week of December, 2020, initially

allowing an eight-week period to return the application.

An issue was raised by some applicants regarding the ability to obtain proof of income.

Limerick City and County Council contacted the Department of Social Protection and have

been provided with a link, which will facilitate an online statement that will meet the

requirements of the Bin Waiver Application requirements.

The link is as follows:

https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/OnlineStatementRequest.aspx

All Social Media communication platforms will be updated to advise of this extension. Any

member of the public who requires assistance can contact Limerick City and County Council

Customer Service or the Bin Waiver Team.---

**13.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson (to be referred to the Protocol**

**Committee)**

***I will move at the next meeting, that this Council consider erecting a memorial or place of***

***reflection in remembrance of all those who have lost their lives to the river.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Protocol Committee.

**14.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District that Limerick City and County Council***

***look into the feasibility of installing a permanent panoramic or Ferris wheel at Arthur’s Quay Park***

***and work with the relevant stakeholders to build it into future plans for this location.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Sullivan, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Sullivan highlighted the positive impact of the Christmas

lighting along the river and the Ferris wheel and these should be considered as part of the long-

term development of the area.

**REPLY:** The Panoramic Wheel Company is a private company, which has successfully traded in

Limerick over the past 3 years as part of the Civic Festival programme.

When bringing forward future development proposals for the Arthurs Quay Park area of the

city, the Council can consider the technical and financial feasibility of a permanent Ferris

Wheel as part of the development options.

**15.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next meeting of Limerick Metropolitan Council that the National Transport***

***Authority and Telfourth Ltd are invited to brief Council members on the current operations of the***

***Limerick bike scheme and future plans for the scheme.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Donovan highlighted a number of issues with the existing

Bike Scheme and the extension of the Scheme and the urgency to meet with the National Transport

Authority and Telfourth Ltd to address these concerns.

**REPLY**: The Coca-Cola Bike scheme in Limerick is operated by the National Transport Authority.

Should the members resolve to invite the National Transport Authority and Telfourth Ltd to

brief Council members on the current operations of the Limerick bike scheme and future

plans for the scheme, the Physical Development will request a presentation on the Coca-

Cola Bike Scheme.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will move at the next meeting of Limerick Metropolitan Council that Covid-19 mobility plans for***

***South Circular Road and Howleys Quay be reinstated during Level 5 restrictions.***---
8

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Donovan and seconded by Councillor Novak Uí

Chonchúir.

**REPLY**: During the Summer of 2020, Limerick City and County Council put in place COVID-19

mobility measures on South Circular Road and Howley's Quay. The purpose of these plans

was to reduce the numbers of motor vehicles, create more space for pedestrians/cyclists,

allow for events to be held in Howley’s Quay, create more space for pedestrians/cyclists and

to gather data from the trials to inform future permanent active travel enhancement at both

these locations. It should be noted that, in addition to reduced lockdown transport

movements at the time, the measures took place at a time when schools were closed and

transportation movement in the city was reduced also due to ‘holiday’ movements out of

the city.

The trials have informed the Council on particular issues that arose and associated problems

that need to be addressed in the future long-term proposals. The Council is now

progressing permanent long-term schemes for active travel at both these locations.

Consultants are, and will, develop these schemes, utilising lessons learned from the trials.

Consultation with affected stakeholders will take place during the coming months and a

planning process will be advanced with a view to putting in place permanent active travel

measures as soon as possible following the consultation and planning process.

If the Council were to re-introduce similar COVID-19 measures during the current period,

where schools/businesses are likely to re-open within weeks, it could be seen as the

imposition of measures without appropriate consultation. Indeed, it would be akin to trying

to predetermine the outcome of the proposed consultation process and the long-term

active travel needs appropriate to both locations.

The Council fully believes that active travel improvements are needed and appropriate at

both locations and are engaging in the consultative procedures needed to get to the

appropriate final solutions. Accordingly, the imposition of summer 2020 COVID-19 type

measures is not considered appropriate at this time.

Members agreed that extensive engagement and consultation with the public, as outlined in the

response to the Notice of Motion, was very important and that a planned approach was required

to ensure success over the long term.

**17.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District that Limerick City and County Council***

***write to the I.S.P.C.A. and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine**to urgently reinstate***

***the position of an Animal Cruelty Inspector in Limerick City and County.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor McSweeney, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor McSweeney stated that animal cruelty is a serious issue in the

city and county and highlighted the urgency that an Animal Cruelty Inspector would be reinstated

in Limerick.---
9

The Members agreed that animal cruelty should not be tolerated and they noted that An Garda

Siochana and the Dept. of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were the agencies with primary

responsibility for this issue. They highlighted the importance of ongoing co-operation between

these public bodies and Limerick City and County Council in trying to deal with this issue.

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

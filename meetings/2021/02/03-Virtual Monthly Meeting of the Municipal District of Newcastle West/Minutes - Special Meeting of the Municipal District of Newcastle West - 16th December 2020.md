At the outset of the Meeting, the Cathaoirleach welcomed everyone to the Meeting.---
The Director commenced by referring to the Chief Executive’s Reports on the Part 8 applications.

He stated that no major objections to the proposals had been received during the public

consultation process and that the proposed works were broadly welcomed.

The Members acknowledged the work to date on developing the Great Southern Greenway and

the great amenity it is to both locals and tourists alike.

They also queried the new surface currently being laid on the Greenway and its effect on the

natural flora and fauna along the route which could be brought to the Environmental Strategic

Policy Committee, disability access to the Greenway, the farm crossing at Coolybrown Ardagh,

and it was also queried when would the Greenway be re-opened following the current re-

surfacing works.

In reply, the Director, stated that the pathway along the Greenway is over 3 meters wide and the

natural hedgerows along the route are not impeded. He also noted that the Council has an

Environmental Awareness Officer who could work with interested parties on plans to enhance

biodiversity along the Greenway. Also a maintenance programme is being developed for the

Greenway. He also noted that a solution had been agreed for the farm crossing at Coolybrown,

Ardagh.

The Senior Executive Engineer also noted that the material being used to re-surface the

Greenway was the same as is used on public road re-surfacing. He also noted that there are

National Strategy Guidelines for the development of Greenways which outlined best practice and

this is also being followed. It was also noted that the Rathkeale to Ardagh section of the

Greenway will shortly be re-opened following re-surfacing works.

Discussion also took place on the need for an additional underpass at Ballybehy and the access

points at the railway house Abbeyfeale and the Devon road onto the Greenway. The need for re-

forced road surfaces along the route where heavy machinery could be crossing from one portion

of farmland to another was also discussed. It was noted that these matters are being addressed

and the Council have been engaging with the individuals concerned.

**2. General Municipal Allocation**

Discussion took place on the re-opening of the tennis club in Newcastle West and the work which

club now has over 500 members and although some minor maintenance work was carried out to

improve the facility additional infrastructural works are required. These include security fencing

and lighting. It was noted that the Council is the owner of the site of the club but there is a lease

in place to the tennis club. Funding in the amount of €30,000 is been sought under the GMA

Strategic Projects allocation for security fencing and lighting.

Discussion took place on the project and the work put in by Councillor Ruddle on getting the club

re-started again. Other funding streams for the development of projects such as Sport Capital

Grants, Community Enhancement Schemes and the funding of projects and announcement of

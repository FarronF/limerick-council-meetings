The Director and Acting Senior Executive Planner gave an update to the Members on the

current status with regard to the development of pipeline sites in the District. The Acting

Senior Executive Planner outlined to the Members the proposed developments in the Build

Programme which included Mountcollins, Colbert Terrace, Abbeyfeale, Sycamore Crescent,

Newcastle West, Broadford, Athea and Woodfield Manor, Newcastle West. She also gave an

update on the number of units and stages of each development and stated that a total of

ninety one units are in the pipeline for the District.

A discussion followed on Approved Housing Bodies and the Members referred to various

projects within the District including Corrán Deel Voluntary Housing and Clúid Voluntary

Housing Bodies. The Director stated that the Housing Development Directorate work with

these Housing Bodies to support funding applications to the Department to allow various

projects to proceed and meetings are held with these groups in this regard. The Members

expressed disappointment with regard to the Woodfield Manor Newcastle West project

where 30 of the 68 units are to be managed by an Approved Housing Body, given the concerns

they raised at a recent meeting with the Housing Development Directorate.

Discussion also took place on the Housing Application form and the need to include smaller

towns and villages where the Council had either purchased property or where Approved

Housing Bodies were progressing housing projects. It was noted that applicants may prefer

to remain in their local communities if there was suitable accommodation available rather

than moving into larger towns.

Support Services Directorate

Consideration of Amendment to Standing Orders

To consider amending Standing Orders to allow for remote meetings

in light of Local Government Circular LG 07-2020 “Guidelines for

Supplementary Orders regulating the proceedings in relation to

remote meetings of the Council” and “S.I. No. 445/2020 – Civil

Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 (Section

29) (Local Authorities) (Designation) Order 2020.

Circulated, report of Meetings Administrator, Municipal District of Newcastle West,

dated 27th November, 2020, and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage

Circular LG 07 2020 dated 30th October, 2020.

Following discussion on this matter, the Members expressed an overall preference for onsite

attendance at District Meetings, however given the current pandemic, arrangements needed

to be put in place to hold meetings in instances where it may not be possible to hold physical

District meetings. It was agreed that in light of the current pandemic having a Supplementary

Item added to the Standing Orders to regulate the holding of remote meetings should be

approved. The addition of the Supplementary Item to Standing Order was proposed by

Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Scanlan with the recommendation that the

QUESTIONS

5.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I will ask at the next Meeting (a) do the Council operate a paint your house scheme in any***

***of the Municipal for Metropolitan Districts (b) can we implement a paint your house scheme***

***for Local Authority housing.***

REPLY:

At present Limerick City and County Council do not currently operate a “paint

your house” scheme in any municipal district.

A pilot “self-help” scheme, which commenced in August 2020 is currently in

operation in Cappamore Kilmallock electoral areas. Works are completed by

contractors and inspected by council staff. There is an option included in this

scheme for painting the exterior of a house. However, the take up by the

tenants of this option has been limited.

Once the pilot project is complete, a full review will be undertaken which will

formulate the basis of any future “self-help” scheme.

In addition, for clarity purposes, under insurance advice previously sought by

the Council’s Health and Safety Section, Housing Maintenance cannot supply

painting materials directly to tenants to undertake painting themselves, due

to liability issues.

6.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

***I*** ***will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the works for Ward’s Cross and Devon Road***

***Cross.***

REPLY:

**(i)**

**N21 Ward’s Cross**

The scheme has progressed through the design process since the previous update on the

scheme. All departures applications have been submitted in accordance with TII Departures

from Standards procedures. All departures have been approved by Transport Infrastructure

Ireland, subject to the provisions of a revised feasibility report to TII. This has been prepared

by Mid West National Road Design Office and submitted to TII.

In accordance with TII Procedures for Road Safety Improvement Schemes and TII’s Project

Management Guidelines we have submitted a report for formal TII approval, to proceed to

preparation of tender documents and the allocation of funding.

Completion of the tender process is dependent on the TII approval and the completion of

discussions with Irish Water and subsequent design of the necessary water main diversion.

Barry Transportation will liaise with Irish Water regarding the realignment requirements of

the water main to be undertaken as part of the project.

**(ii)**

**Devon Cross**

A feasibility report has been submitted to TII for approval of the recommendation to create a

staggered junction and for allocation of the necessary funding. We are endeavouring to

secure this funding to allow Barry Transportation to proceed with the detail design process

and preparation of tender documents.

As an interim measure, it is proposed to seek funding to install signage on the R515,

approaching the N21, to improve visibility of the N21/R515 junction until such time that

funding is available to construct the recommended option. This signage has been designed

and a feasibility report submitted to TII requesting funding to install the signs. A road safety

audit has been undertaken and the signage design is currently being updated based on the

road safety audit recommendations. Installation of signs will be undertaken by the area office

once allocation of funding has been approved by TII.

Councillor Galvin noted that funding had recently been made available from Transport

Infrastructure Ireland to Kerry County Council for road improvements and noted that funding

should also be made available to Limerick City and County Council to progress the necessary

works at Wards Cross and Devon Cross.

REPLY:

**(a)**

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting when the hedgerow at the opposite side between the***

***Churchview Estate and the Parochial House at Castlemahon be tidied up.***

REPLY:

Contact will be made with the landowner and arrangements will be made to

carry out these works.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting for a speed warning lighting system to be installed***

***along the R522 between Tiermeana Bridge and Ardnacrohy Height.***

REPLY:

This location is on a Regional road where the default general speed limit of

80kph applies. It is not Council policy to provide driver feedback signs at

locations such as this. Enforcement of speeding regulations in these areas are

a matter for the Gardai.

Councillor Scanlan submitted a petition which had been signed by eighty householders living

in this area with regard to introducing speed control measures on the R522 road between

Tiermeana and Ardnacrohy, Newcastle West.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will ask at the next Meeting that safety measures be implemented on the Pallas side of the***

***Priest’s house when approaching Kilmeedy along the R519 from Tireagh Cross.***

REPLY:

The above can be considered for a Low Cost Safety Scheme. However as an

interim measure road markings will be improved in this area.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Scanlan.

REPLY:

Please note below the response received from Irish Water.

“I have forwarded the query to the appropriate department for review and

response. Once an update becomes available, a member of our team will be

in contact with you.

Your Irish Water reference number is 57801, which you can keep for your own

records.

I understand this issue is a source of concern for you and the members of the

Newcastle West MD, please bear with us while we await an update”.

Notwithstanding the above reply, Irish Water facilitated a workshop with

Councillors on Monday, 23rd November where this matter was discussed and

Councillor Galvin was advised that Irish Water would be in contact directly in

relation to the outage referred to and actions arising.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Galvin acknowledged the assistance of the Council staff

in dealing with this matter and requested that Irish Water notify customers in advance

of known interruptions to water supply. He also requested that Irish Water invest in the

provision of generators should there be an interruption to water supply.

13. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting*** ***that we request a Meeting with representatives of The***

***Board of Management of SMI to discuss their proposed input towards resolving the***

***residential congestion and traffic flow difficulties along Boherbee.***

residents of Meadow Court Estate to attend a Meeting of the District to discuss traffic issues

14. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

***I will move at the next Meeting*** ***that consideration be given to reconfiguring the traffic***

***flow at Ballykennedy Cross (Dore’s) in the interest of safety.***

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Collins.

REPLY:

Due to the existing junction layout and lack of available sightlines, particularly,

with regard to right turn movements, there is merit in reconfiguring traffic

flows here.

A Road Safety Audit will be arranged, An Garda Siochana will need to be

consulted and there may be a requirement for minor land acquisition.

Once Traffic Surveys and maps are prepared, a Public Consultation process by

means of a Section 38 Notice in accordance with 1994 Roads Act should be

carried out.

The following items were also raised.

The issue of overgrown hedges and the cleaning of roadways after hedge cutting was also

referred to. In replying, the Executive Engineer gave an update to the Members on this

matter. He agreed to follow up on overgrown hedges at forestry owned lands in the Municipal

Response to Mr. Bruce Harper’s question if it was known how much the LSMATS will increase

carbon emissions, and whether the Council had put a process in place where carbon proofing

will be included in the evaluation of major decisions and projects, in accordance with the local

authority Climate Charter.

1. The draft Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy forecasts an annual

reduction in vehicular emissions of 37,572 tonnes per annum over a 30-year strategy period.

Following the recent public consultation on the LSMATS, the NTA has indicated that it will

review the climate change considerations contained in the document.

2. Action 147 of the Climate Action Plan 2019 includes for, inter alia, the introduction of a

local authority Climate Charter. Section 3 of the Charter provides that local authorities, with

the support of Central Government, will undertake a wide range of climate action activities

including a commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% and increase energy efficiency to

50% of the baseline year (2009) by 2030.

A sub-committee of the Local Government Management Agency is currently in the process of

establishing Key Performance Indicators for the commitments contained in the Climate Action

Charter. Once finalised all local authorities will have to report on their performance against

the indicators.

3. At a national level a process is underway to develop the methodology by which public

bodies will calculate their emissions reductions. We await the outcome of this process. It is

likely that each local authority will have to account for its emissions and energy reduction

targets as part of the climate action plans proposed under Section 12 of the Climate Action

and Low Carbon (Amendment) Bill, when enacted.

4. Action 4 of the Climate Action Plan provides for the publication of legislation – the Climate

Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020, published in early October 2020

and currently progressing through the Oireachtas – which will give legal standing to the

Climate Action Plan 2019.

Section 3 of the Bill – as it is currently constituted – states that “The State shall pursue the

transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy by the end of the year 2050.”

Section 12 of the Bill - *Role of Local Authority* – provides for the insertion, after Section 14 of

the parent Act, of Section 14A which provides that the Minister shall request local authorities

to make a 5-year local authority climate action plan which will specify mitigation and

adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority, within 18 months of the

commencement of the Section. It is anticipated that included in the climate action plan will

be the mechanisms by which the local authority intends to meet the emissions and energy

efficiency targets contained in the Climate Action Plan 2019. Ministerial guidance on the

content and preparation of the local authority climate action plan is also provided for under

Section 14A of the Bill.

5. Forthcoming guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency relating to Green

Procurement, which are due to issue in Quarter 1 2021, are likely to include for the mandatory

inclusion of green criteria in all procurement using public funds, within 36 months.

Mr. Harper queried what baseline year did the NTA use in calculating the emissions reductions

contained in the LSMATS. Mr. Kennedy confirmed that he will enquire from the NTA as to its

methodology.

In response to a further question from Mr. Harper, Mr. McGuigan confirmed that Limerick

City and County Council signed the Climate Action Charter in November 2019 and is awaiting

national methodologies to be developed for the targets.

**Item 3: Presentation on proposal for School Streets Initiative (+CityxChange** **–** **Climathon**

**Schoolgates Group).**

Ms. Sinead Hourigan from Urban Innovation department gave a brief introduction to the

Climathon process as part of the +CityXChange project and introduced the representatives

from the Climathon School Gates Group. She invited Mr. Aidan Hogan, Ms. Anne Cronin, Ms.

Aine Farrell and Mr. Eoin Buckley to begin the presentation.

The presentation highlighted the need to ensure safe and fun environments for children at

school gates. The proposal is based on pilots in other Irish cities. The presentation set out

the situation of the school, the traffic congestion experienced at peak times, the safety issues

associated with this congestion and the air quality implications of same.

The presentation outlined a number of possible responses including school zones and school

streets approaches.

Cllr. Leddin thanked the Group for their interesting presentation. He added that cyclist's

safety is important and if the infrastructure is in place, people will use it. He referred to the

success of the segregated cycle lane on Shannon Bridge. He also added that consultation is

key and opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Secas welcomes and supports the proposal. She added that such a pilot project is very

timely as the Limerick Development plan is currently being developed, and sees the

opportunity to include the learnings of a school zones or school streets pilot in the first phase

of the plan. She noted that consultation would play a very important role in the success of

any initiative.

Cllr. Butler stated the presentation gave a good understanding of the issues facing schools

and is pleased to see progress at St. Paul’s school. He supports the pilot but would also like to

see more focus on pedestrians as part of the Council’s strategy. He stated that the gridlock is

a particular problem for residents and added that the importance of having students and

parents drive this will give the best results.

Cllr. O’Donovan fully supports the initiative and the pilot is very welcome. She advised that

the school zone in Laurel Hill is reverting back to old habits and suggested that some of the

NTA funding be used to paint the street to slow motorists down, and to restrict cars going

down the avenue.

Dr. Catriona Cahill, on behalf of Limerick Chamber expressed her support of school zones and

school streets and added that the pilot ticks all the boxes in relation to attracting new FDI to

the area.

Cllr. Novak wished to remind the Committee that this issue has been discussed before at a

previous SPC meeting. She would now like to get a commitment from the Council to deliver

and progress the pilot to other schools, and focus on primary schools.

Cllr. McSweeney acknowledged that there has been huge investment in the area of Active

Travel in recent months. He asked if this pilot scheme is part of the safe route to school

funding and who will lead the consultation process. He added that it is important to consult

with all the stakeholders.

Cllr. Michael Sheehan expressed his support of a great initiative and wished the group well in

the next stage of the pilot. Mrs. Maureen Browne also wished to express her support of the

initiative.

Cllr. Leddin thanked the group individually for the presentation. He concluded the discussion

by saying this is a very positive initiative and it deserves due diligence.

In response to a question in relation to leading the consultation process, Mr. Kennedy added

that the impact of closing streets will need to be examined in detail as there are multiple

logistical issues that need to be addressed. It will require discussion with school principals and

other stakeholder groups, in particular external funding stakeholders, to come up with

solutions. It is in everyone’s interests to reduce the impact of school transport and he is keen

to look at all possibilities.

Mr. Gallagher added that the Council is actively promoting walking and cycling active modes

and is it is very good to start with young children. He added that the executive is fully

supportive of a pilot and added that good consultation will be key.

Cllr. Butler asked if the Council would take the leadership on the consultation process if

required. Cllr. Leddin stated that the local authority could lead the initiative on this for

appropriate locations.

**Item 4: Presentation on Local Improvement Scheme** **–** **Service Operations (Mr. Hugh**

**McGrath).**

Mr. Hugh McGrath delivered a presentation on amendments to the Local Improvement

Scheme. The purpose of the presentation is primarily to inform the members and also to make

a proposal in relation to how the schemes should be ranked and prioritised going forward.

The Chair opened up the floor to comments / questions.

Cllr. Michael Sheahan stated that a lot of rural members are very dissatisfied with the

ineligibility criteria being proposed and find them difficult to accept. He referred to a recent

Council meeting at which Cllr. John Sheahan proposed that the members write to the City and

County Manager’s Association and ask to consider withdrawing the proposal it had agreed to,

so that the Minister could make the necessary amendments to the proposed scheme.

Cllr. Teefy advised that there is a big issue in relation to the ineligibility of gates in

passageways, which are there for security. She added that it is very unfair to disqualify

applicants who were already qualified.

Cllr. John Sheahan gave an outline of the background of the local authority taking avenues

into public ownership, to be done under a local improvement scheme. He expressed his

disappointment at the changes and the lack of consultation with elected members. He also

felt that prioritising roads was not a good proposal, as the present process of chronological

ranking is fair and transparent. He argued that this has put Councillors in a difficult position.

Cllr. Martin Ryan echoed the concerns of previous speakers in regard to the gates issue and

people not feeling safe in their own homes. He called for the issue regarding gates be

revisited, and suggested that eligibility should be on a first-come-first-served basis.

Mr. McGrath stated that the the main purpose of the presentation was to propose a review

of the scheme and he was highlighting the issues that were coming from the Department. He

understands the member’s frustration and is hoping that the SPC would review the

prioritization strategy.

Cllr. Mitchell added his dissatisfaction to the prioritization and stated gates should not be a

reason for exclusion from the scheme.

Cllr. Teefy asked what criteria is being used for people applying now.

Mr. McGrath advised that applicants should continue to apply and they will be added to the

list however, there is an obligation to implement the criteria set out in the 2020 outline

document. He stated that a workshop for members would be held with a view to putting a

number of options before the SPC for discussion and agreement.

Cllr. Leddin requested a workshop for clarity in the New Year. Mr. McGrath agreed and is

hopeful of holding a workshop before end of January.

Cllr. Ryan asked if there could be workshops for the separate electoral areas and Mr. McGrath

agreed that he would be happy to facilitate.

Mr. Kennedy undertook to ask that Corporate Services write to the Department outlining the

concerns that the Members have raised.

**Item 5: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor F. Kilcoyne (referred from the**

**Metropolitan District).**

“I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting, to request free car parking for Limerick city to

be enacted for one year, when Limerick is ready for reopening (which is now) after this Covid-

19 pandemic. I believe that to bring footfall back into our city, shoppers should be given 3

hours free car parking at any time of the day to help retailers”.

In proposing the Notice of Motion, Cllr. Kilcoyne added that he was very pleased to see last

week that Councillors had taken the initiative to give free parking in carparks around the city

and also the Council’s own carpark.

In a written response Mr. Kennedy stated that Limerick City and County Council provides

approximately 3,500 parking spaces in the city centre, with one of the lowest parking fees in

the country. The Council’s budget for 2021 provides for income of €1.926m for parking fines

and charges. To reduce the amount of revenue generated by removing parking charges would

result in an unbalanced budget.

In order to support businesses during the Covid-19 emergency, the Council waived car parking

charges for an extended period over the summer months and has agreed to provide free

parking at weekends. In addition, the annual free Park and Stride service is being provided

for the extended festive season, with car parking available to the public at the Cleeves’ Car

Park and at the Irish Rail Depot on Roxboro Road.

Cllr. Kilcoyne added that the Council is not doing enough for retailers in the city, a lot of whom

are struggling. He proposed that even one hour of free parking would help businesses in the

city.

Cllr. Leddin stated that all members will share Cllr. Kilcoyne’s sentiments in encouraging

footfall into the city. He added that the solution is most likely striking a balance between the

revenue aspect of it, the management of parking in the city and at the same time facilitate

the increase in footfall. He concluded that it merits further discussion and he is happy to

facilitate that for Cllr. Kilcoyne.

**Item 6: Any Other Business:**

With the Chair’s agreement, Ms. Drake asked if the Wichkam St. Cycle lane was constructed

accordance with S.I. No. 332/2012 - Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2)

Regulations 2012?

In reply Mr. Gallagher stated that the cycleway was constructed in accordance with the

regulations. He added that it is illegal to park on a cycle lane and LCCC is currently trying to

resolve issues around the bollards by discussions with stakeholders.

Ms. Drake stated that you can only have a cycle lane or a loading bay, you can’t have both.

She accepted the response and looked forward to the resolution.

Mr. McGrath replied that bollards were installed owing to concerns regarding public liability

issues, and that this decision was now being reviewed. He stressed the need to come up with

a solution that meets the needs of all concerned parties.

Mr. Harper advised that it was reported in the Limerick Leader that a commitment was given

to retailers that no bollards would be placed between Thomas St. and Wickham St. and

wished to know on what authority was this given.

In response Mr. Gallagher replied that consultation is progressing to resolve the issue. The

Chair asked for forbearance whilst consultation is ongoing.

The Chair closed the meeting by wishing all a safe, peaceful and happy Christmas.

NOTICE OF MOTION Update

The Elected Members were provided with an update on the Notice of Motion submitted by

Councillor M. Ryan at the September 2020 Meeting regarding the pedestrian crossings on

the N24 at Pallasgreen and Oola. Councillor M.Ryan confirmed his satisfaction with the

update.

4. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

I will move at the next meeting that TII and Limerick City and County Council review the

safety of the pedestrian crossing on the N24 at Pallasgreen and OOla, do they need to be

upgraded to Stop/Go lights and also to review the traffic calming measures in Pallasgreen

and Oola.

**Reply:**

The existing pedestrian crossings in Pallasgreen and Oola have been reviewed. The review

has determined that both crossings are adequate for use, but some minor modifications (as

a result of recently updated TII standards) could be carried out. Both crossings were

designed and constructed in accordance with the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and

Department of Transport (DTTAS) standards for Zebra Crossings which were in place at the

planning stage of both schemes. The TII have in the interim released revised standards

which make very minor modifications to the design of zebra crossing schemes. Central

Services propose to update and refresh the road markings at both crossings and also to

replace the tactile paving at Pallasgreen. A works package will be prepared and submitted

to TII to fund the changes. It is not proposed to upgrade either crossing to traffic signal

controls.

The traffic calming measures in place have also been reviewed and there are no proposals

to revise the existing infrastructure in place.

8. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

I will move at the next Cappamore/Kilmallock meeting to ask Management to engage with

the National Broadband roll out programme to prioritise the roll out of fibre broadband in

the Cappamore/Kilmallock area reason being the increased reps from people trying to work

and educate from home.

**Proposed by Councillor M. Ryan;**

**Seconded by Councillor Donegan.**

The Elected Members requested that National Broadband Ireland deliver a Workshop or

presentation to the Municipal District early in 2021.

**Reply:**

Under the National Broadband Plan, high-speed broadband will be delivered to every

premises in Ireland through a combination of commercial and state investment. For

Limerick, the State have determined that 78% of premises are in the commercial (Blue) area,

an area in which commercial operators have indicated that they currently are or will shortly

be providing a broadband service in that area. The remaining 22%, which equates to 21131

premises including homes, farms, businesses and schools, are in the State Intervention Area

(Amber), an area in which commercial operators do not and have no plans to provide a

broadband service, and where the State has committed to ensuring access to high speed

broadband for all citizens.

The company delivering on this commitment on behalf of the State is National Broadband

Ireland (NBI). The latest information available from NBI indicates that some parts of the

Cappamore/Kilmallock MD have already been surveyed, with a view to having networks

built and connected in 2021. These include the areas around Caherconlish, Oola and

Galbally. The next area to be surveyed will be what NBI denote as the Hospital Deployment

Area, which includes towns such as Pallasgreen, Herbertstown, Hospital, Knockainey and

Bruff. NBI intend to survey this deployment area before the end of 2021, although they are

actively working to accelerate this plan due to the challenges COVID 19 has caused for

citizens trying to work from home. In this regard, NBI have increased the number of their

survey and network design contractors, and have also engaged with Openeir to see if it can

increase the volume of works carried out on its network to make the existing pole and duct

infrastructure ready for fibre deployment.

While the main deployment is ongoing, Broadband Connection Points are rural locations

within the State Intervention Area where a free high speed (500Mbps) public broadband

connection will be provided for both indoor and outdoor use by the local community, in an

effort to support remote working and promote connected communities, and help

communities to quickly access free pubic high speed broadband in advance of the main

deployment under the National Broadband Plan. Under this programme, Limerick City and

County Council has had five Broadband Connection Point locations approved in the

QUESTIONS

14. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for an

update on the planned replacement of the existing public light fixtures/bulbs on the main

streets in Kilmallock.

**Reply:**

These works commenced last week and in total twenty no. existing public lights will be

upgraded along Sarsfield Street before the end of January 2021.

15. Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock for an

update on the planned replacement of the existing old and damaged street signage in

Kilmallock town.

**Reply:**

These works were commenced prior to works on Road Schemes in early 2020 however were

not completed due to on-set of Covid. Upon resumption works commenced immediately on

the Road Scheme works and only finished in the last week or two so the Roads Team did not

get an opportunity to return to signage works. It is intended that these signage works in

Kilmallock town will commence again in the new year.

16. Question submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock when the

upgrade of street lighting will commence in the Cappamore/Kilmallock area.

**Reply:**

Limerick City and County Council is participating in the South West Region Public Lighting

Energy Efficiency Project that is being managed by the Road Management Office and Cork

County Council. This project is currently a tender stage and it is expected that a contractor

will be appointed in Q2 2021. A detailed programme of works is not yet agreed, but it is

anticipated that the replacement of lights in Limerick will commence later in 2021.

17. Question submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock if there is

any progress in plans to establish a Civic amenity centre in the east if the

Cappamore/Kilmallock area.
---

**Reply:**

The Southern Region Waste Management Office has recently completed a review of Civic

Amenity Centres, as part of a national process. The next step in the review process is that

all Civic Amenity Centres will be classified and mapped. This will facilitate the determination

of whether and where new Civic Amenity Centres may be required.

It is anticipated that this process will be undertaken in 2021.

A copy of the Review document is available from the Southern Region Waste Management

Office.

18. Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

I will ask at the next Municipal District meeting of Cappamore-Kilmallock that consideration

be given to carrying out improvement works at the bad bend on the Lough Gur to Holy Cross

road L1500.

**Reply:**

These works would need further exploring due to their location in Lough Gur. The

possibility of undertaking major excavation works here maybe limited in particular with the

policies to support and conserve the archeological, architectural, environmental and cultural

features of Lough Gur. This was further evident as part of the Part 8 planning procedure

that was undertaken as part of the development of the shared use road at this location.

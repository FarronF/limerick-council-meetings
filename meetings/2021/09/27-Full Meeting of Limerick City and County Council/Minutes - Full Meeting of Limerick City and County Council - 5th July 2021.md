Local Property Tax

Circulated, report from the Director, Support Services, dated 30th June, 2021, in

relation to Local Property Tax – Local Adjustment Factor 2022.

The Director, Support Services explained that the authority to vary the base rate of the Local

Property Tax (LPT) is prescribed in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act, 2012, as amended by

the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013. He then proceeded to give a

PowerPoint presentation updating Members in relation to the following:

**Local Property Tax**



That the Government had recently announced plans to proceed with a revaluation of

Local Property Tax later in 2021, to take effect for the 2022 liability year;



That Heads of a Bill have been published by the Government with the intention that the

necessary legislation will be enacted by the Oireachtas before the Dail summer recess;



The legislation has brought forward the deadline for notifying Revenue of the Local

Adjustment Factor (LAF) to the 31st August in a revaluation year;
---
5



The Department had clarified in June 2021 that the yield from LPT for 2022 will be at

least the same as the 2021 Baseline which was €17,554,464;



Valuation bands were being widened for calculating LPT liabilities to ensure that most

homeowners will face no increase when properties are revalued on the 1st November,

2021;



Property valuations to be reviewed every four years;



New properties will be brought into the system each November and that this would

amount to an estimated 3,333 new properties, based on data from the Central Statistics

Office (CSO);



Local authorities to retain 100% of LPT collected in their area;



Public Consultation-The public consultation process regarding the LPT was advertised

both online and in the local media and submissions had to be received by 28th June,

2021. One submission was received requesting no change on 2021.

The PowerPoint presentation went on to cover Property Valuation Bands, and the standard

rate applicable to each Band, and an analysis of % properties within LPT Band in Limerick City

and County Council, and the Impact of Variation of LPT (Income).

He outlined the five-year programme funded by the LPT Rate Variation and stated that the

total value per annum was €2.4m which was allocated as follows for 2021:

Local and Regional Roads/Traffic Management/Street Cleaning

€768,000

Other Local Services (Fire/Library etc.)

€442,000

Capital Investment in New Plant to Deliver Efficient Local

Services

€400,000

Urban and Rural Regeneration Fund

€550,000

GMA

€200,000

He added that a report had been prepared for the Members, and circulated with the Agenda,

setting out the matters to which the Members must have regard in making a decision on the

LPT, including the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

Based on preliminary projections for Budget 2022, he confirmed that the Council has

additional unfunded demands and the main items contributing to this on the income side are

limited Commercial Rates buoyancy, the impact of Covid 19 and Brexit on collections, and

continued appeals to the revaluation process. On the expenditure side, he also confirmed the

main variances as loan charges, insurance, and Covid 19 Economic and Public Realm

Revitalisation.

The Members thanked the Director, Support Services, for the PowerPoint presentation and

for the Workshop organised for Members on the Local Property Tax. The Members noted the

importance of the funding stream from the Local Property Tax on the delivery of many

important services across the local authority, including General Municipal Allocation funded

works.
---

They noted that if the proposed variation of the Local Property Tax did not go ahead, that

charges for services elsewhere would have to be increased or else certain services or projects

that were planned, may be curtailed or not go ahead.

Councillor Benson stated that there should be no variation of the Local Property Tax and that

the current rate of Local Property Tax should apply for 2022, as people already had enough

financial difficulties as result of the Covid pandemic.

Councillor J. Sheahan proposed to vary the Local Property Tax basic rate upwards by 15% for

2022. This proposal was seconded by Councillor M. Collins.

Councillor Benson proposed no change in the Local Property Tax basic rate for 2022. This

proposal was seconded by Councillor Costelloe.

Following discussion, the Meetings Administrator confirmed that there were two proposals

before the Members and clarified that, in accordance with Standing Orders, the Amendment

would be voted on first. Accordingly, the Mayor called a vote, in the form of a show of hands,

on the Amendment proposed by Councillor Benson and seconded by Councillor Costelloe.As

the majority of the Members were in favour of varying the Local Property Tax basic rate

upwards by 15% for 2022, the Mayor declared the proposal from Councillor Benson defeated.

The Mayor confirmed the proposal of Councillor J. Sheahan, seconded by Councillor M.

Collins, as carried and accordingly the following resolution was adopted:

Proposed by Councillor J. Sheahan;

Seconded by Councillor M. Collins;

And Resolved:

“That, in accordance with Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act, 2012, as

amended, Limerick City and County Council hereby determines that the basic rate of Local

Property Tax (LPT) should stand varied upwards by fifteen per cent (15%) for the year 2022 in

respect of relevant residential properties situated in the administrative area of Limerick City

and County.”

Welcome Address and Update on University Status

Professor Cunnane, President, Limerick Institute of Technology welcomed the Mayor and

Elected Members and staff to the Millennium Theatre for their meeting, and he thanked the

Members for giving him the opportunity to update the Members on the historic change for

Limerick Institute of Technology, which was to take place from the 1st October, 2021.

From that date, there would be a merger of two Institutes of Technology, namely Limerick

Institute of Technology and Athlone Institute of Technology, to become the Technological

University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest. The campuses for this new Technological

University would be situated in Limerick City, Limerick Moylish, Athlone, Ennis, Thurles and

Clonmel. This new Technological University would comprise 14,500 students and 2,000 staff
---

across the six campuses, with a total economic output of approximately €420 million per

annum.

He outlined how the new Technological University will drive regional development and socio-

economic progression, will facilitate local and regional higher education access and course

choice, with university level qualifications for students in their own areas. This will benefit in

attracting enterprise, skills retention and creation and increased direct investment into the

regions served by the university.

It will also further expand the capacity of research and training that will not only support

indigenous and multi-national companies already in the Midlands and Midwest, but will

encourage further investment and development outside of Dublin.

The Technological University will help to meet these needs through developing the skills base

and human capital of the Midlands and Midwest regions. Focusing on higher vocational,

technical, technology-based and professional skills will be central to this objective. Raising

regional productivity in the Midlands and Midwest will be essential for future economic

development in these regions, especially in the indigenous enterprise sector.

He also confirmed that a wider and deeper skills base will also make both regions more

attractive for inward investment, especially by overseas companies, and will help to grow

future jobs and incomes – making for a better balance of spatial development in Ireland.

He acknowledged the close co-operation and support received from Limerick City and County

Council and other agencies over the years, and he looked forward to a continuance of this in

the years ahead with the establishment of the Technological University. He also noted the

work of Limerick 2030 in the development of the City Centre, he referred to the exciting

development of the new campus in Coonagh, and referenced LIT’s sponsorship of the LIT

Gaelic Grounds and the tremendous success enjoyed by Limerick hurling in recent years.

The Members welcomed the update on the new university status and praised the work and

contribution that LIT had made, especially on the North side of the City. They agreed that this

new Technological University would mean that Limerick would now have two universities,

which was an exciting development for Limerick and the Mid-West region.

The Members agreed that this development would also make the region more attractive for

inward investment, especially by overseas companies, and will help to grow future jobs and

incomes, while also making for a better balance of spatial development in Ireland, which was

also to be welcomed.

with national guidelines, a comprehensive review and update should occur at least

every five years. The next review should commence no later than November 2022 to

allow adequate time for consultation.

10.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Keary

**I will ask at the next meeting, in relation to the Limerick Regeneration Process: (a) Since**

**Limerick Regeneration began, how much money has been spent on this project; (b) The total**

**number of houses that have been demolished in all of the three areas to date; (c) The**

**number of new houses that have been constructed at the three locations to date; and (d)**

**The proposed no. of houses to be constructed at these locations in the future.**

**REPLY:**

The Vision Plans for the regeneration of Southill and Ballinacurra Weston and

for Moyross prepared by the Limerick Southside Regeneration Agency and

Limerick Northside Regeneration Agency respectively were launched by

President Mary McAleese in January 2008. These documents set out the broad

objective for the regeneration of these three areas and followed the

publication of the Fitzgerald Report in April 2007. The publication of the

Limerick Regeneration Masterplan - A vision for Moyross, Southill/Ballinacurra

Weston and St. Mary's Park followed in October 2008.
---
11

**(a)Since Limerick Regeneration began, how much money has been spent on**

**this project:**

Expenditure in the first phase of Regeneration from start-up in 2007 to

June 2012 is €152,282,611 when Regeneration was managed by the

Limerick Regeneration Agencies. The Regeneration Agencies ceased in

2012 and the Regeneration Programme was transferred to Limerick City

Council. Expenditure by Limerick City Council and Limerick City and County

Council from June 2012 up to 2021 is €244,996,702. The spend relates to

specific projects and objectives under the Social, Economic and Physical

Framework Plans of the adopted Limerick Regeneration Framework

Implementation Plan (LRFIP).

**(b)The total number of houses that have been demolished in all of the three**

**areas to date:**

The demolition programme in the first period (up to the adoption of the

LRFIP in February 2014) followed the objectives set out in the Vision Plans

launched in January 2008 and the Regeneration Masterplan launched in

October 2008. In line with the ambition of the Limerick Regeneration

Masterplan published in 2008 under the Limerick Regeneration

Agencies which favoured a ‘clean slate’ demolition approach and

reflecting a sharp population decline in the regeneration areas over a 30-

year period, **895 vacant and in some cases derelict or partially-derelict**

**houses were demolished during the Limerick Regeneration Agency’s**

**tenure from 2007-2012**. To put this in context, the population of the areas

involved declined by between 48 and 70 per cent in the 30 years up to

Census 2011. In simple terms, many people had left these areas with a

resultant spike in the number of vacant units, which adversely impacted on

the quality of life of remaining residents and gave rise to additional

problems with anti-social behaviour.

A comprehensive review of the programme was carried out from June 2012

*(following the transfer of responsibility for regeneration from the Limerick*

*Regeneration Agencies to Limerick City Council)* to September 2013, which

had regard to all relevant factors including the prevailing and projected

economic circumstances. During the consultation process, the principle of

large to full-scale demolition was reassessed. In addition, retention and

refurbishment options were reviewed and identified, which shifted the

focus away from wholesale demolitions. This reviewed approach is now

embedded in the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan

(LRFIP) - a robust, evidence-based, measurable Implementation Plan

adopted by elected members in February 2014.
---
12

**The number of units demolished since the adoption of the Limerick**

**Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) in February 2014**

**across the 4 areas is 381 units. This includes demolitions in recent times**

**in St. Mary’s Park** **to deal with anti-social behaviour issues as part of a**

**joint task force approach between An Garda Síochána and Limerick City**

**and County Council.**

In accordance with the commitment to review and Monitor the Limerick

Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP), the *Demolition and*

*Retention Strategy* for the four regeneration areas was reviewed in 2015

and again in 2018. The outcome of the review in 2015 saw the retention of

an additional 44 houses (i.e., reduction in demolition of 44 houses). The

review in 2018 saw the retention of an additional 36 houses in total with

the two reviews, an additional 80 no. units were retained (i.e., reduction in

demolition of 80 houses overall). Given that new housing proposed in the

regeneration areas is replacement housing, the overall number of houses

required, based on the calculation adopted in the LRFIP in 2014, reduces

from 593 to 513 replacement homes.

**(c)The number of new houses that have been constructed at the three**

**locations to date;**

**(and the total number of new houses, apartments built in each area):**

269 units have been completed to date across the four areas.

 30-36 Moylish Road (7 units)

 Cliona Park Phase 1 (34 units)

 Vizes Court Phase 3 (29 units)

 Southill Older Persons Accommodation (35 units)

 Wallers Well Phase 1 (10 units)

 Cliona Park Gap Site (2 units)

 Cliona Park Phase 2 (10 units)

 Lord Edward Street (81 units)

 Churchfield Phase 1 (a), (b) and (c) (42 units)

 St Mary’s Park Infill Housing (19 units)

**(d)The proposed number of houses to be constructed at these locations in**

**the future:**

 Churchfield Phase 2 – 38 units - 18 month programme – site start

August 2021 - substantial completion 01/02/2023.
---
13

 Cosgrave Park – 30 units – site start July 2021 - substantial completion

01/08/2022.

 Daglaish Park – 27 units – site start September 2021 - substantial

completion 01/12/2022.

 Cliona Park Phase 3 – 18 units – site start July 2021 - substantial

completion 01/10/2022.

 Infills Moyross/Southill – 38 units – site start April 2021 – substantial

completion 01/04/2022.

 Sheep Street – 8 units – site start September 2021 – substantial

completion 01/12/22.

 45/46 Cliona Park – 2 units – construction commenced – substantial

completion 01/07/2021.

The type of properties these are (one, two, three, four etc. bed properties)

Each of the four areas have a different bed-type demand profile (based on

the approved housing waiting list) that the new build replacement housing

schemes meets.

On average, across the four areas, the profile for bed-types delivered and in

progress is as follows:

 1 bed: 15%

 2 bed: 43%

 3 bed: 38%

 4 bed: 3%

 5 bed: 1%

Quay respectively. Cycle connectivity between the two schemes is provided

Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan

**I will ask at the next meeting for an update on the Regeneration plans for Thomond Weir.**

**REPLY:**

BHP have completed vertical and horizontal testing of the concrete piers and

core results have been provided to Garland Consulting Engineers. Initial

assessment would suggest that the piers have capacity for select vehicular

movements.

However, a final conclusion cannot be made until such time as the foundation

of the individual piers is assessed by Dive and Marine Contractors. Such an

assessment has not been undertaken to date due to the high flow rates and

water levels in the Shannon.

Dive and Marine are scheduled to inspect flows at Thomond Weir on the week

commencing 5th July, 2021, and assess if flows are low enough to allow divers

undertake the assessment of the foundations. They are also to discuss same

with the ESB to check as to the frequency of any planned discharges.

Assuming river conditions are favourable, Dive and Marine intend to mobilise

in the coming weeks. It is envisaged that Dive and Marine will issue a report

on the foundations within four weeks of mobilising.

On receipt, Garlands will then finalise their structural assessment and will issue

their feasibility report within a further four-week period.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

**I will ask at the next Meeting, as part of the CFRAMS flood prevention measures, have**

**O’Dwyer’s Villas, Thomondgate, and New Road, Thomondgate, been included, given their**

**close proximity to the River Shannon and the likelihood of further flooding.**

**REPLY:**

O’Dwyer’s Villas, Thomondgate, and New Road, Thomondgate, are within the

Scheme Area for the Limerick City and Environs Flood Relief Scheme. RPS

Consulting Engineers have recently been appointed to progress this scheme.

RPS will be completing a full review of the initial CFRAM Preferred Options at

these locations. The Initial Preferred Option in the CFRAM Study included a

combination of walls and embankments to protect properties at these

locations, details as per attached drawing.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

**I will ask at the next Meeting what are the future** **plans for Sonny’s** **Corner, which was**

**designated for housing up until recently when work ceased due to the discovery of one of**

**the original Stone Gateways into the ancient City; and will the Council preserve this**

**important piece of local history given its location to the Medieval Quarter.**

**REPLY:**

The presence of the city defences at or near the site at Sonny’s Corner and

traversing the adjacent site at St. Ann’s Court was anticipated. Sections of the

city wall are upstanding further along the street towards Exchange Street, and

parallel to the Island Road beyond St. Ann’s Court. Historic mapping also

showed the outer line of the city defences crossing the former small housing

estate at St. Ann’s Court in a NNW/SSE direction, crossing the road

incorporating a gate known as Little Island Gate and returning SW/NE along

the northern boundary of the site at Sonny’s Corner. In addition, the mapping

shows an earlier line of defences extending along the western boundary of St.

Ann’s Court in line with Bishop Street. Sonny’s Corner was immediately outside

the city wall.

The chronology of the area of St Ann’s Court was that it lay immediately

outside the earlier city wall. In the last quarter of the 12th century St. Peter’s

Cell, a nunnery was founded and at the turn of the 13th century, the city

defences were expanded to the east to incorporate the precinct of same. By

1540 the nunnery buildings were ruinous and the area had become fallow. By

the 17th century, the site had been built on and in the mid-19th century, at least

half of the street was occupied by a leather tannery. The most recent

development was built in the 20th century.

Prior to acquisition, a preliminary archaeological assessment had flagged these

issues. The assessment recommended advance archaeological test trenching

and a final design that would bring the line of the wall back into the public

realm, with the layout reflecting its location. The most recent test trenching

took place when the 20th century houses in St Ann’s Court were demolished

and the site was secured. The city wall extends SSE across the site just below

ground level. It is up to 2m wide and there is a height of at least 2m surviving

below ground level. At the rear of the footpath on the northern side of the

road a faced break in the wall was identified. This is likely to be the northern

side of the opening for Little Island Gate. No testing was carried out in the

street. The outer face of the city wall was exposed at Sonny’s Corner returning

northward in line with the faced break.

There is tremendous potential in any future development to highlight and re-

establish the line of the wall and the location of the gate. City defences are

considered to be of national importance and are therefore designated as

National Monuments and protected under the National Monuments

(Amendments) Act 1930-2014. As a member of the Irish Walled Towns

Network Limerick City is very aware of the importance of its city defences.

Since their destruction in the 18th century they have become fragmented.

Redevelopment of this site has the potential to re-unite over 80m of the early

13th century defences.

The Limerick City and County Council team, working on the feasibility for

affordable and social homes on the site, will now use this detailed

archaeological investigation to inform and dictate the character, sense of place

and nature of the planned residential development possible in the area. The

exact location of the wall will inform the design process and there is

tremendous potential for any future development to highlight and re-establish

the line of the wall and the location of the gate in the public realm.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Keary

**I will move at the next Meeting that all resources and spending by the Limerick 2030**

**Company be equally divided between City and County in the interest of balanced economic**

**sustainability for both areas.**

In proposing the Motion, Cllr Keary stated that he was not aware of any projects being

developed by Limerick 2030 in the Municipal Districts and that he believed that it was not fair

that its efforts were directed primarily in the City Centre, and he believed the County was

being neglected as a result. This Motion therefore was an attempt at rebalancing the

resources and spending by the Limerick 2030 Company between City and County.

The Meetings Administrator explained that legal advice suggested that this Motion would

cause a difficulty for the directors of Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC under the Companies Act

2014.

**REPLY:**

Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC is a separate legal entity to the Council and in

relation to the notice of motion under consideration, our legal advice is what

is proposed in the motion would cause a difficulty for the directors of Limerick

Twenty Thirty DAC under the Companies Act 2014.

Directors of a company have fiduciary duties under Section 228 of the 2014

Act. The duties are stated in general law, rather than specific terms and as they

are derived from Common Law they are not intended to be exhaustive. The

duties under Section 228 are owed by the directors to the company and the

company alone. There are eight fiduciary duties and they include

 To act in accordance with the company’s constitution.

 Not to agree to restrict the director’s power to exercise an independent

judgement, unless this is expressly permitted by the company’s

constitution.

 Exercise the care, skill and diligence, which would be expected in the same

circumstances by a reasonable person.

It is essential that the rights and duties of directors of a separate legal entity

to the Council are not modified in such a way as to put them in apposition of a

potential breach of fiduciary duty and thus expose them to a potential personal

liability.

Therefore, I recommend that notice of motion does not proceed so that the

Directors of Limerick Twenty Thirty DAC are not put in a position where they

could be liable for a potential breach of fiduciary duty.

**the termination of pregnancy legislation, so that women can access healthcare in privacy,**

**dignity and with respect.**

Correspondence

The Correspondence circulated with the agenda was taken as read.

21. Pyrite Issue

With the permission of the Mayor, Councillor Keary referred to the issue of defective

concrete block products caused by pyrite, that had affected homes across the country in

recent years, leading to major problems for homeowners of these affected homes.

He confirmed that this was also an issue for homeowners in Co. Limerick and he referred to

a recent reply to a Dail Question by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and

Heritage, which referred to the Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks

in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020. The reply also stated

that the pyrite remediation scheme was recently extended to include the administrative

area of Limerick City and County Council, which will see homeowners of dwellings with

significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in Limerick, eligible to apply for remediation

works under the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.

The reply also stated that similar to what is happening in other counties seeking admittance

to the scheme, that the local authority would lead on the rigorous analysis required in

appropriate submission to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

Proposed by Cllr Keary, seconded by Councillor K. Sheahan.

**I will move that this Authority will commence the analysis required in accordance with the**

**IS 465 protocol and make the appropriate submission to the Department of Housing, Local**

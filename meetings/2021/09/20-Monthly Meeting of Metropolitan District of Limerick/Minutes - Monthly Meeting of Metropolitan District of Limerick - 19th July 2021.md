**QUESTIONS**

**5.Question submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for the numbers of***

***accommodation units located in the student villages on the Old Cratloe Road used by Limerick***

***City and County Council for housing allocations, including Thomond Student Village and Cratloe***

***Wood Village, with a breakdown per development and type of allocation (i.e.***

***emergency/temporary/permanent).***

**REPLY**: Currently, Limerick City and County Council has 13 long-term leased houses in the former

Section 50 Student Village (Thomond). The type of accommodation tenure is transitional

in nature with those tenants approved for a transfer in accordance with the Scheme of

Allocations. Previously, short-term lettings had been engaged in Cratloe Student Village

for emergency accommodation but this no longer happens as family numbers have fallen.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor A. Talukder**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many taxi licences***

***have been issued, and how many taxi rank spaces are in place, in the Metropolitan District and***

***if it is possible to direct existing CCTV cameras, or install new CCTV cameras, to monitor the taxi***

***ranks in the city area.***

**REPLY**: The number of current taxi rank spaces available under the provisions of Limerick City

and County Council appointed stands (Street Service Vehicles) Bye Laws 2006 and

Limerick City and County Council appointed stands (Street Service Vehicles) (Taxis)

Metropolitan District Draft Bye Laws 2018, is 87 spaces including 10 number proposed

at Saint Nessans Road adjacent to Limerick City University Hospital at Dooradoyle.

Currently 62 spaces operate 24/7hrs: 14 spaces operate 17:30hrs: to 06:30hrs: and 11

spaces operate 17:30hrs: to 04:00hrs:

The use of CCTV apparatus to monitor taxi ranks for the purpose of issuing Fixed Charge

Notices is prohibited under current G.D.P.R. regulations.

The estimated cost of providing CCTV apparatus at taxi ranks where CCTV is not currently---
4

available is €100k.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many Approved***

***Housing Bodies are actively involved in housing in the city area and of said amount how many***

***do not allow succession of tenancy.***

**REPLY**: At any one time, Limerick City and County Council is actively engaged with approximately

20 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBS) delivering a variety of services mixed between

homeless services with emergency accommodation and permanent social-rental housing.

Approved Housing Bodies do not allow succession tenancies as operated by Local

Authorities. However, occupants remaining in a property can apply to the AHB for

Succession Consideration. No automatic succession allows AHBs deal with areas such as

under occupancy, which allows for a more efficient housing management system of

returning houses to allocation teams.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many vacant Council***

***owned properties for sale have Limerick City and County Council advertised for an expression of***

***interest in the Metropolitan area and what are the properties advertised.***

**REPLY**: We currently have 9 vacant Council owned properties for sale in the Metropolitan

District. Three of these are For Sale by Expression of Interest and are listed below:

 Former Garda Station, Mary Street, Limerick.

 29 Nicholas Street, Limerick.

 35 Nicholas Street, Limerick.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when will the CCTV***

***camera on O’Dwyers Bridge, which will service Athlunkard Street, Sir Harry’s Mall, and par**ts of***

***Corbally, be complete and be fully operational given the amount of anti-social behaviour in the***

***area.***

**REPLY**: There are 3 cameras to be completed at a single location adjacent to the bridge.

The ESB have completed their works in bringing power to the location.

The final commissioning of the CCTV cameras can now be completed by the CCTV

contractor.

These works are scheduled to be completed by the 16th July and the cameras will be

activated shortly afterwards.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to Project Ivy***

***or any other circumstances where the Council are taking on long term leases from pension***

***funds, what checks are the Council putting in place to ensure that these pension funds have not***---
5

***competed with first time buyers when acquiring properties.***

**REPLY**: The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of

social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the leasing of houses

and apartments. Dwellings under the scheme come from a number of different sources

including private owners, commercial entities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and Part

V.

The leasing arrangements in place to date undertake a rigorous pre-assessment as

follows:

 A check against housing need in area for bed type proposed.

 An assessment of the level of social-rental in an area to avoid overconcentration of

one type of tenure.

 A check to ensure that there is vacant possession.

 A check to ensure no first time buyer is bidding. The Housing Directorate seek

confirmation that First Time Buyers are not engaging/bidding on the property. If it is

confirmed that First Time Buyers are bidding, the Housing Directorate will not support

the unit under Long Term Lease.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, how many long term***

***leases have the Council acquired through pension funds and how many properties have each***

***pension fund supplied to the Council? (e.g.: Company A has supplied x houses, company b has***

***supplied y houses. The Council have acquired y leases in total.)***

**REPLY**: Long-term lease arrangements, including the enhanced lease, of privately owned

dwellings can be entered into by either local authorities or AHBs. Under these

arrangements, the local authority or AHB acts as the landlord to the tenant. The terms of

these agreements are set out in standard template agreements provided by my

Department, which must be used, by all local authorities and AHBs. Agreements may

be entered into for periods of between 10 to 25 years in duration; availability agreements

under the CALF scheme can be up to 30 years in duration.

Since the leasing arrangements commenced with Limerick City and County Council in

2019, the following commercial entities have signed Long Term Lease Agreements with

the Limerick City and County Council:

**12.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, what is the average***

***monthly rent for a 1, 2 and 3-bed unit, for long-term leases already agreed under Project Ivy.***

**REPLY**: The table below sets the unit type, number of units and average monthly rent for

commercial entities availing of long-term leasing with Limerick City and County Council.

The rent paid to Lessors under the scheme is 80% of market rent for houses in a non-

managed development and 85% market rent where management fees apply for units in a

managed development. Rent reviews under standard long-term leasing occur on the third

anniversary of the commencement date and every third year thereafter. These reviews are

based on changes in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). With Limerick City

and County Council, leases with commercial entities commenced in 2019, in line with

Government policy to enable this social-rental supply stream. Data therefore has been

collated for 2019, 2020 and 2021.

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on a***

***meeting of Metropolitan Councillors and the NTA regarding the public bike scheme, and if there***

***is any update on when the King*** ***John’s / Limerick Castle station will be reopened.***

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**14.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we extend an***

***invitation to the Chief Executive of Clúid Housing to address the Elected Members of the District***

***with regard to the bulk purchase of homes in Laurelville, Mill Road, Corbally.***

Councillor O’Sullivan stated that she wished to withdraw this Notice of Motion.

**15.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Talukder (to be referred to the Community,**

**Leisure and Culture Strategic Policy Committee)**---
7

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that consideration be***

***given to the provision of a cricket ground within the Limerick Metropolitan District area.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Community, Leisure and Culture Strategic

Policy Committee.

**16.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor A. Talukder**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that railings and gate***

***access are provided at Mount Kenneth Skate Park on the Dock Road, and that opening and***

***closing times for this skate park are introduced which are similar to opening and closing times***

***of other public park areas in the Metropolitan District.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor Talukder and seconded by Councillor O’Dea.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Talukder highlighted issues of noise and anti-social behaviour

at the Skate Park, which were causing great difficulty for residents in the area.

In the course of the discussion, some Members stated that they were not in favour of providing

railings and gate access.

**REPLY**: The existing railing in Mount Kenneth Skate Park is 1.2m high and is designed to

assimilate with its urban setting and to match the treatment on Shannon Bridge. The park

is very popular and is well used most especially by young people. This is all the more so

with Summer weather. As with all Council owned and managed amenities, the Council

keeps the use of the park under review. It must be borne in mind that now we are in

Summer time, there is natural light available well into the evening and good weather and

the usage of the park is greatly increased at this time. This will, of course, reduce as the

evenings shorten and weather disimproves. As an immediate measure, the Council will

arrange for signage to be erected, alerting users of the nearby residential area and

requesting users to vacate the Skate Park by 9pm latest, in the interest of residential

amenity.

The Council can investigate the provision of new higher railings / gates. It is estimated

that this may cost up to €50,000 for which there is no budgetary provision.

**17.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that the record be***

***corrected to reflect the accuracy of the Regeneration building program regarding the recent***

***answer given to another Councillor which stated that Vizes Court, Wallers Well and Lord***

***Edward Street developments are included in the numbers of houses built under the***

***regeneration scheme which is not accurate.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor O'Sullivan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kiely expressed concern that funding for Regeneration

projects was used outside the Regeneration areas.---
8

Members requested that updated boundary maps for each Regeneration area would be

circulated to them.

**REPLY**: The housing developments of Vizes Court, Wallers Well and Lord Edward Street were

funded under the Limerick Regeneration Programme and allocations from the

regeneration areas were made to all the developments. I can confirm that these

developments are outside the red line of the regeneration area.

**18.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to Bus***

***Eireann and the NTA to ask why O’Malley Park, Southill is*** ***without a service after 6pm for 10***

***years now and insist that a service is restored as soon as possible.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M) and agreed.

In proposed the motion, Councillor Kiely expressed concern at the withdrawal of the bus service

to O’Malley Park and the difficulties and isolation this caused for the community.

**REPLY**: From the 3th of January 2021 the NTA restored the 303 bus service after 10 years to

O’Malley Park, Southill area beyond 6pm however as a result of persistent anti-social

behaviour the service has been withdrawn again due to health and safety concerns for

Bus Éireann staff and passengers. The matter is to be reviewed again in the coming weeks

by NTA/Bus Éireann.

Members supported the motion and agreed to also write to the Minister for Transport.

**19.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that in light of the***

***recent increase in dog ownership, Limerick City and County Council carry out an intensive***

***marketing campaign to promote the purchase of dog licences in Limerick City and County.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan and seconded by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Hartigan stated that there was a large dog population in

Limerick and income from dog licences could provide extra facilities.

Members referred to the application for funding for dog litterbins and requested a list of areas

where bins will be allocated. It was agreed that this would be provided at the next meeting.

**REPLY**: The total number of dog licences issued in 2020 was 8424. This is the highest number of

dog licences issued by Limerick City and County Council. In the last 4 years dog licence

numbers have increased by approx. 1000.

Indications so far for 2021 are that licences at year end will be approx. 200 ahead of the

2020 figure.---
9

The concentration in relation to information campaigns this year has been on dog fouling

and dog control but all literature includes information on licencing.

It is intended to run a social media campaign on licencing specifically, post summer to

drive licence uptake before the end of the year.

**20.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir (to be referred to the**

**Protocol Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council revive the twinning partnership with the City of Quimper in France and re-***

***establish the longstanding connection between the two cities.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Protocol Committee.

**21.Correspondence**

Correspondence was noted and taken as read.

This concluded the Meeting.

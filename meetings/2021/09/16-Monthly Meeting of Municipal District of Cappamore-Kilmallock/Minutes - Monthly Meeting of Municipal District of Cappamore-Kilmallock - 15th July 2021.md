Any Other Business

Councillor Michael Donegan thanked his elected colleagues for their support of his

submission to Iarnrod Eireann on Fanstown crossing and apologised for his omission of

Councillor Eddie Ryan and Councillor Martin Ryan in the report submitted.

Councillor Donegan raised the matter of the proposed directly elected major position saying

there was discussion in the media on the matter and it would appear that the powers of the

directly elected mayor do not reflect what was proposed in the initial government report on

the matter. Councillor Donegan said he had a fear that the proposed directly elected mayor

position could dilute the current powers of the elected members and proposed the matter

be paused until the 2024 local elections and further clarity be sought.

This motion was seconded by Councillor Mitchell.

Councillor Mitchell in supporting this motion said the Public had not been given the full facts

on the matter and the process should now be delayed indefinitely adding that the reserved

functions of the Councillors would appear to be diminishing year on year and the current

status quo should be left as it is.

Councillor Teefy concurred with these sentiments saying the Directly Elected Mayor will only

be a lobbyist and the position would add a very expensive extra layer to Council with no

additional powers and added the campaign surrounding the Directly Elected Mayor had

been rushed and not enough clarity provided on the subject.

Councillor Ryan (Eddie) agreed also with these sentiments saying he felt the matter had not

been thought through properly and proposed a special meeting be convened to discuss

Councillor Mitchell’s motion with the permission of the Chairman.

This proposal was seconded by Councillor Carey who added he could not see the Directly

Elected Mayor system working out.

Councillor Egan also supported the postponement of the Directly Elected Mayor positon

saying the full facts were not know at the time the position was originally proposed.

Councillor Mitchell concluded the discussion on the matter saying the process is flawed as

the full facts were not available at the time the process was initiated and called for the

publication of the draft legislation on the subject.

Councillor Carey asked the Council rethink the imminent eviction of a family in the

Kilmallock area and ask the Council instead to engage with the family involved and provide

assistance to make their home habitable.

Councillor Teefy requested that additional electric vehicle charging points be installed in the

District given the increase in the purchase of electric vehicles and asked for a progress

report on this matter for the September meeting.

Brian Kennedy (DOS) agreed to follow up on this item for the September meeting and added

that policy in relation to electric vehicles is currently with the Transport and Mobility SPC.

Brian Kennedy said an application has also been made to the National Transport Agency for

funding, however he added the grants only cover a fraction of the costs associated with the

installation of charging points and agreements have to be agreed with Electric Ireland on

location points.

Councillor Egan called for the Municipal District to convene a meeting with the Cuan Mhuire

Group in Bruree to allow all the elected members to see the great work carried out by them.

It was agreed the Meetings Administrator would make contact with Sister Agnes at Cuan

Mhuire after the summer recess with a view to making arrangements to convene a

Municipal District at the Centre.

Councillor Teefy requested a housing workshop to be held before the September Municipal

District meeting to discuss housing vacancies and repairs staffing etc.

previous Sunday to deal with a flooding incident.

Services Section, on the death of Dermot Whelan.

All members wished to be associated with these sentiments.

unit which will be a one-storey one-bedroom house, provided it meets necessary criteria.

The new houses will form an extension to the existing residential development of Radharc an
Ghleanna.

A design tem comprising of a Civil and Structural Engineer, a Mechanical and Electrical

Outturn costs for the air-to-air heating system accounted for 15% of the average cost of the
upgrade works, just under €7,000 ex VAT, per unit. Average out turn cost amounted to just

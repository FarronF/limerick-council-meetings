**QUESTIONS**

**4.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council how much funding has been applied and secured from***

***the Department of Transport to facilitate additional echarging stations and how many additional***

***stations are planned.***

**REPLY**: To date Limerick City and County Council has not made any applications for funding for

additional Electric Vehicle (EV) charging points. Under the Climate Action Plan 2019 the

Government has set an ambitious target of replacing 840,000 private internal combustion

engine (ICE) powered cars with electric vehicles. In order to do this, the CAP2019 recognises

that there will be a need to expand the charging offer available to the public, and as such

contains an action that by 2030 local authorities will provide 2,000 on-street charging

points. To incentivise this, SEAI has made available a grant of €5,000 per charging point (2

charging points per pillar).

EV car ownership remains relatively low in Ireland with less than 20,000 EV sold since 2010,

although sales of EV are doubling on average year on year. This is symptomatic of an

emerging market where cost of purchase of EVs, battery capacity, and re-charging

availability have all contributed to the slow uptake.

European and UK studies show that 80% of EVs are charged at home, with about 10%

charged at work, 5% on fast Motorway chargers (long distance journeys) and 5% on-street,

and emerging Irish trends would appear to largely replicate this. Central Government grants

are available via SEAI towards the cost of installation of an EV charging point at a private

residence (50% of the cost up to €600), and incentives on the cost of new EVs and reductions

in VRT on EVs remain at present. In the Irish context ESB eCars has introduced fees for EV

charging at its 1,100 on-street charging points in 2019 (fast chargers) and 2020 (slow

chargers) and this will push EV owners towards more home charging, where that is possible.

At a national policy level DCCAE/SEAI is currently finalising guidelines for local authorities

on the technical considerations of providing EV charging points, and the back office systems

which come with the service. Simultaneously, a working group of the City and County

Manager’s Association Environment sub-committee is formulating a guidance document on

the different business model options and the four Dublin authorities are finalising a study

on best practice in the location of EV charging points. All these documents will be finalised

in 2021 and will inform our approach to on-street EV charging.

**5.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council what progress is being made on strengthening***

***relationships between the Council and business community not represented by business***

***organisations to facilitate plans to increase footfall in our city.***

**REPLY:**

Since the creation of the post of City Centre Revitalisation Officer (CCRO) in March

2020 a focussed approach of engagement with the city centre business community

has taken place. A key objective of the CCRO is to work with the business community

to increase footfall in the city centre.

In June 2020 the Council launched its Shop Limerick Campaign to assist businesses

to trade on-line and to provide them with business supports (training, mentoring,

trading on line vouchers etc.) to cushion them against the impact of COVID

restrictions.

The Council worked in partnership with the business community, Limerick Chamber

of Commerce, Independent Traders, and the Local Enterprise Office to provide a

suite of business services to assist in preparing for businesses to re-open.

Direct contact was made with active businesses on each street and with Councillors

to encourage participation in the initiatives resulting in the formation of an

independent traders group. The Council now engages with over 200 businesses in

the city, represented by the Independent Traders Group and the Limerick Chamber

of Commerce.

The CCRO and relevant internal staff now meet with the City Centre Traders Steering

Group every 6 weeks to discuss issues of common interest. This group is made up of

representatives of the Independent Traders Group, Limerick Chamber of Commerce,

and the Gardaí. This group is instrumental in the co-ordinated approach to the

promotion of Limerick as a destination for the Christmas period.

The CCRO also meet with businesses on an individual basis to assist on local issues.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask Limerick Metropolitan Council to conduct an audit of all empty Georgian buildings in***

***the city and outline what level of engagement is or has taken place to encourage owners to***

***redevelop their properties.***

**REPLY**: The Forward Planning Department have carried out land use surveys of the city centre. The

most recent of which was carried out in November 2019. The survey identified use and

vacancy across floors in buildings. Separately, the Urban Innovation Department is currently

carrying out a building condition survey of buildings in the Georgian core. The survey will

be completed in early 2021.

The Council are actively working on encouraging and supporting the redevelopment of

historic buildings in the city centre through a number of programmes:

 The Urban Innovation Department (UID) manage the Living City Initiative – a tax

incentive scheme designed to support the refurbishment of historic (pre 1915)

properties. Since its relaunch in 2018 the UID have actively promoted the scheme

through the holding of events and seminars as well as the production of promotional

material and videos. Furthermore, the UID have liaised with the auctioneers within the

city to promote the scheme as part of the sales pack for properties within the qualifying

area.

 To support people wishing to refurbish historic properties the UID operate “one stop

shop” advice clinics for property owners and potential property owners which are

attended by the Conservation Officer, Fire Officer,  Area Planner as well as relevant staff

from the Urban Innovation Department. These are held every 2 weeks on an

appointment basis.
---

To date a total of 40 applications have been received for residential development under the

initiative. Commercial developments are managed directly by the Revenue Commissioners.

 The Urban Innovation Department is also working on developing solutions to some of

the specific challenges faced by people redeveloping these building.

 Funding has been secured under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund to

redevelop two existing Council properties for residential use. The projects are at

preliminary design stage.

 The +City xChange EU project is examining methods that enhance the energy

performance of historic buildings and potential financial mechanisms that could

support these works.

 In respect of fire safety, the Urban Innovation Department has secured funding from

Enterprise Ireland under the Small Business Innovation Research to develop

potential sensor based solutions to meet the requirements of the building

regulations.

In both of these projects the Urban Innovation Department are working directly with

property owners to develop solutions to these issues.

Other initiatives operated by the Council include:

 Conservation grants – The Planning Department through the Conservation Officer

administer a number of conservation grant schemes on behalf of the Department on an

annual basis. These schemes are advertised in the local press when the Council are

advised by the Department.

 Department administrating the Derelict Sites Act who are actively engaging with

property owners to bring derelict properties back into use.

 The Property and Community Facilities Department are responsible for operating the

Derelict Sites Act and are actively engaging with property owners to bring properties

out of dereliction and to compulsorily acquire them if necessary.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on when derelict houses in Kennedy Park and Hyde***

***Road that are in Council stock will be refurbished and allocated.***

**REPLY**: At present we have carried out clear-out works to a number of houses.

Our next step is to review the level of works required based on a detailed scope and

costings.

This information will then be submitted to the Department for approval.

As soon as the funding approval is received, the works can be procured and contracted out.

Within a set timeframe of the completion of works the allocations team review the Housing

Waiting List and begin the allocations process.

We will keep the area Councilor’s informed of progress in relation to the houses in this area.

At present, the detailed capital appraisal for the projects is being prepared for submission

to the Department.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting, following up from your response to my question in September 2020***

***in regards to flood defences for Mulcair Drive, Annacotty, Mountshannon Road, Castleconnell***

***and Montpellier, have tenders been returned and the successful consultant appointed.***

**REPLY:**Tenders for “Limerick City & Environs Flood Relief Scheme: Integrated Engineering and

Environmental Consultancy Services” were returned on 23rd October 2020. Tenders are

currently being assessed and, conditional on no appeals being submitted, it is expected that

consultants will be appointed in January 2021.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting if the noise action plan sent to Transport Infrastructure Ireland from***

***Limerick City and County Council in regards to noise pollution from the M7 and M20 has been***

***acknowledged.***

**REPLY:**The report on noise mitigation options prepared by Limerick City and County Council for the

M7 and M20 noise hotspots was submitted to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in

September 2020.

Representatives from Physical Development Directorate met with representatives of TII in

October 2020 where the Council’s findings were presented. TII undertook to consider the

content of the reports and provide feedback, including technical comments on the reports.

We are awaiting a response from TII.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for a list of the criteria the Council uses to consider the location of***

***parklets in the city.***

**REPLY*:*** Applications from businesses for parklets are considered on a case-by-case basis. Among

the criteria considered are:

 Health and Safety

 Traffic flow/pedestrian permeability

 Future development and road maintenance work

 Consultation with adjoining business

 Loading bays, click and collect and parking facilities

 If the premises serves food

 If the premises has no available outside space

 Hours of opening of premises

**11.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting the capacity for bike parking on the newly installed bike stands on***

***Parnell Street and the reason behind this number of bike stands on this street.***
---
7

**REPLY:**The location and number of cycle stands installed as part of the Parnell Street

Improvements Project was based on available space and balancing allocation to loading

bays/landscaping/footpaths/parking and cycle lanes. Each cycle stand can accommodate

two bicycles, one either side.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting for information on the risk assessments carried out to determine***

***the cycle safety equipment installed on Wickham Street could be removed without endangering***

***the public.***

**REPLY:**Where regulatory road markings known as continuous or solid white lines are provided (as

they are on Wickham Street) to delineate cycle facilities from the vehicular carriageway,

such road marking provide that motorists must not stop on, or cross, a solid white line,

except for the purposes of loading/unloading goods and picking up/ setting down

passengers.

In recent times we have (as have other roads authorities) installed ‘wands’ (collapsible light

sticks) and other delineating highlighters in such locations for various reasons including

enhancing delineation, discouraging parking and discouraging long duration set-down(in

particular where strict enforcement is a challenge). Councillors will be aware of many

successful installations such as those outside the nearby mainline railway and bus station

(Colbert Station) whereby the installation of delineators has resulted in issues associated

with blocking of the cycle lane being resolved at this location. It is important to clarify that

wands are primarily used as a temporary visual aid to assist an already highlighted cycle

lane and as such will not prevent errant drivers or deliberate driving across the solid white

line (an act which is a road traffic offence). As cycle lanes are becoming more commonplace

there is a need to increase awareness of the regulatory restrictions associated with them

and such awareness will assist in compliance and as the general public develops an

understanding of their status one hopes that the need for ‘wands’ and delineators will

reduce.

As with all locations, prior to the installation of such measures, the Roads Authority gives

careful consideration to ensuring that such measures do not inhibit unreasonably the

facility of traders/residents to load/unload goods and pick up/ set down passengers.

While I am satisfied that we had made or could make such provision, in this case some of

the traders did not accept our position and thus in the interests of good relations we agreed

to remove a section of the installed wands to allow for a further review of options and

regulatory provisions. This review will be advanced.

In summary it should be clear that the safety of the public is determined more through

common courtesy, respect for others, and the understanding of and adherence to, the rules

of the road than relying on the installation of flimsy delineators. The Installation of or

removal of such delineators are a very poor relation to safe driving and cycling, and

awareness and respect for others.

Notwithstanding this where (as is the case in most city centre facilities) full segregation of

cycle facilities is not required or practical we will continue to consider any measures that
---

assist in highlighting such facilities in particular where strict regulatory enforcement is

challenging.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

I will ask the Council to provide a costing spreadsheet for the €10m Active Travel fund, with a

project by project breakdown of funding allocated, funding spent to date, expected delivery date,

**16.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Council for a list of the number of people fined and***

***prosecutions issued for illegal dumping in 2019 and 2020.***

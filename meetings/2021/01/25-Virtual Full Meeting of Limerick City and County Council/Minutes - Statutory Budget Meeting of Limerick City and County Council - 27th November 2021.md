Chief Executive (Mr. P. Daly), then gave an address to Members to set the context for the

2021 Budget:

At the start of 2020 all indicators were showing that our local economy was growing and

performing well. Limerick’s internationalization was continuing with a new brand launched

to help win further indigenous and foreign investment and reflect our resurgence as a thriving

economic and visitor destination.

In March, everything changed as Covid-19 spread across the world and caused unprecedented

disruption. The pandemic has brought the fastest and deepest contraction in the national and

local economy since the financial crisis. At its peak, 45% of workers in the city and county

were reliant on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or Temporary Wage Subsidy

Scheme (TWSS).

In response to the pandemic, the Council implemented Covid Recovery Plans providing crucial

support to local businesses and communities. Our ‘Guiding Limerick thru Covid-19’

administered over €45M into local firms to aid their recovery. The ‘Shop Limerick’ online

platform supported over 230 retailers to trade online in addition to numerous mobility &

urban innovations that were deployed to assist in the reopening of the local economy.

Our Limerick COVID-19 Community Response Team– a strong network of over 1700

committed volunteers were mobilized to deal with calls and referrals and provide a wide

range of support to those in need. At the height of the restrictions, Limerick’s Community Call

was dealing with almost 1000 calls a week from older and vulnerable citizens.

In our economy, there are now signs of recovery. The number of workers accessing income

subsidies has fallen significantly from peak and economic activity is recovering. After a

projected contraction this year due to the impact from Covid-19, the economy should

rebound as global demand recovers. Fiscal stimulus and liquidity-boosting measures should

also support a rebound in domestic activity.

**Outturn 2020**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ended 31 December 2021 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

I have reviewed the up to date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to

break-even on the Revenue Account for 2020 despite challenges faced by the Council with

the Covid-19 global pandemic; however there is pressure on a number of income heads and

ongoing controls on expenditure are in place.

**Budget 2021**

This budget is framed against a prolonged health crisis and a potential no-deal Brexit. The

Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the overall
---
3

level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory, contractual,

legal and other obligations.

It incorporates the decisions made by the Council in relation to the Local Property Tax and

General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocations. The budget proposes no increase in the Annual

Rate of Valuation for commercial ratepayers. The proposed budget schemes such as the SME

Scheme, Tourism Scheme, Business and Retail Incentive Scheme, & Vacancy Refund Scheme

are retained to assist many key sectors of our economy.

Under the Local Government Act, 2001 as amended, the Draft Budget is required to set out

the expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the Council and the income estimated

to accrue to the Council. The budget is underpinned by our Corporate Plan that supports the

overall budget strategy

Despite Covid-19 and Brexit, The economic outlook for Limerick continues to be positive. Job

Creation and investments are continuing. Limerick continues to be one of the top performing

investment locations in Ireland. Since January 2020, Limerick has secured new investments

from Transact Campus Inc., Axiom SL and Bath Fitter Inc. New expansions were announced

for Regeneron, Northern Trust, Edwards Life Sciences and our existing Limerick FDI base are

recruiting on a constant basis.

The Limerick 2030 DAC investments are paying off- The recently completed, award-winning

Gardens International is fully let. The eagerly awaited development of Opera Project has

commenced and contracts are awarded for master-planning of the Cleeves Riverside Campus.

The announcement of the UL city centre campus development is a game-changer for Limerick

and it will prove in time to be a signature investment for Limerick and the mid-west Region.

In addition, the Bishops Quay project is on site continuing the development of our quayside

and wider Riverfront. We are working with The Land Development Agency on master planning

public lands around Colbert Station for a new mixed-use residential district that could

accommodate up to 5,000 people and other exciting developments are under discussion.

The Great Southern Greenway upgrade works commenced on site during 2020 and the

Development of a shared e-workspaces for County Limerick led by Innovate Limerick has seen

new projects announced for Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.

The budget also supports the continued implementation of Limerick’s new brand identity &

strategy to internationalise Limerick as an investment and tourism destination and it is

creating a new narrative & perspective for Limerick.

**Community**

Budget 2021 will actively allow for the further engagement with and support of our

communities. It will address enhancing quality of life for our citizens by supporting new public
---

realm projects & programmes across the City & County in our libraries, galleries, museums,

cultural and arts centres and across events. It also will continue a focus on dereliction/vacancy

and delivery of public realm improvements in our urban areas and villages that will animate

the public space and support place-making activities.

**Housing**

The budget will also help us deliver on targets set out re rebuilding Ireland. It will enable and

improve our own social housing stock and aid in tackling homelessness and support the

regeneration programme.

**Physical**

Provision in the budget is also made to progress key infrastructure projects such as the Foynes

to Limerick route, the Cork to Limerick Motorway, the O’Connell Street urban renewal project

and many others. The budget steps-up our commitment to Climate change 2020 targets,

addresses public lighting innovation and enables us to address the CFRAMS & Flood relief

schemes.

Operationally, the budget will allow us meet our commitments to continue the delivery of

essential and statutory services in housing maintenance, roads, libraries, fire services. It will

allow us to be efficient, effective and committed to providing services that will underpin a

growing and dynamic Limerick.

**Staffing**

Recruitment will continue to fill priority positions arising from retirements and promotions.

The Workforce Planning Programme will be progressed further during 2021 to further ensure

that the structures in place fully support effective service delivery. The professionalism,

commitment and determination of staff to react to unforeseen events was again

demonstrated in 2020 during the many storms and weather events we had to deal with.

The budget also makes clear our Capital Works Program for the next three years - 2021-2023,

which is included with Budget Documentation. This programme is wide-ranging over the 3

year period for a wide mix of key public projects for Limerick and is projected to cost €773M

which is funded from a number of sources, including own resources, national programmes,

grant schemes and debt financing.

In conclusion, the draft budget 2021, which has benefited from very significant feedback from

Members in the Budget process, has committed to further improve service delivery in the

face of severe socio-economic challenges and the member’s decision to vary the rate of LPT

has facilitated this commitment.
---

This budget builds on past budgets that consolidated our Council finances and allowed for the

innovative delivery of many services, programmes and projects that have set Limerick apart

as an enviable location to live in, invest in and visit.

Limerick City and County Council’s response throughout 2020 and as we face into 2021 is

aimed at building resilience & future-proofing Limerick.

Finally, Mayor, I would like to thank you and the Elected Members for all your assistance and

guidance in framing the budget.

I would like to thank my colleagues in the Management team and their senior teams for their

commitment and hard work in preparing this budget.

Special thanks goes to Sean Coughlan and all the finance team for the dedicated work and

support in drafting & presenting the budget, which I am sure you would agree, is exemplary.

I recommend the draft budget to members for adoption.

**It was unanimously agreed that the Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Budget 2021, as**

**circulated to Members, would be read into the Minutes of the Meeting as follows:**

**‘Introduction**

The Draft Budget for the financial year ending 31st December 2021 has been prepared,

circulated to Members and public notice of the Budget Meeting placed in the press, in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014.

Circular Fin 14/2020 refers to the prescribed period that applies for the holding of the 2021

Budget Meeting for Local Authorities as follows: 2nd November 2020 to 30th November 2020.

It was agreed by the Members at the September Council Meeting to hold the statutory Annual

Budget Meeting on Friday, 27th November, 2020, at 10am, at Limerick Racecourse,

Greenmount Park, Patrickswell, Co Limerick. Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001,

as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides that the Budget must be

adopted within a period of 14 days beginning on the day on which the Local Authority Budget

Meeting meets. The Budget therefore must be adopted by 10th December, 2020.

**Budget Process**

The budget process for the preparation, consideration and adoption of the Budget requires

statutory compliance with a number of steps, which can be summarised as follows:
---
6

***Step 1 - Decision by the Council on the adjustment factor to the Local Property Tax (LPT)***

***following a public consultation process.*** This decision was made at the Council Meeting on

28th September to leave the LPT adjustment factor at the 2020 levels.

***Step 2 - Allocation of the General Municipal/ Metropolitan Allocation (GMA).The Draft*

*Budgetary Plan was considered at the following meetings:*

Metropolitan District of Limerick

19th October

Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale

21st October

Municipal District of Cappamore-Kilmallock

15th October

Municipal District of Newcastle West

21st October

***Step 3 - Consultation with the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) and adoption of the Draft***

***Budget by Council.*** Budget Strategy presented to CPG Meeting held on 21st September with

further meetings held on 12th October and 16th November. The Statutory Budget Meeting is

scheduled for 27th November, with a Budget Workshop with Councillors to be held on 20th

November.

***Step 4 - Consideration and adoption of the schedule of Municipal Works by each of the***

***Metropolitan / Municipal Districts.*** These meetings will be convened in early 2021 following

the adoption of the Budget.

***Step 5 - Consideration and adoption of the Service Delivery Plan.*** The 2021 Service Delivery

Plan will be presented to Council at the January 2021 Council Meeting.

Through consultation with the Corporate Policy Group and consideration of the views of

Council as expressed through the different stages of the budgetary process, in particular as

expressed through the Meetings of the Municipal/ Metropolitan Districts, the budget as

presented considers this feedback in a reasoned and balanced manner.

At the Statutory Budget Meeting, the Members will be asked to make the following decisions:

 Adopt the Budget with or without amendment

 Determine the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV)

 Determine the proportion of Rates Refund applicable on vacant commercial premises.

**National Economic Outlook**

The Irish economy suffered a severe shock in the first half of this year, unique in origin and

unprecedented in both speed and scale. The containment measures necessary to limit the

transmission of COVID-19 had a dramatic impact on Irish economic activity in the second

Quarter and, notwithstanding the rebound evident in the third Quarter, recovery remains far
---
7

from complete. Indeed, the third Quarter bounce-back has by-passed some sectors

altogether. The positive impact of this bounce-back has been partially negated by the need

to reintroduce Level 5 COVID-19 restrictions nationally from midnight 21st October for 6

weeks.

For this year, the Department is projecting (on a COVID-adjusted basis) a fall in employment

of 320,000 (c.14 per cent), resulting in an average unemployment rate of just under 16 per

cent. For next year, the increase in employment is projected at 150,000 (7.6 per cent); much

of this is mechanical, in that it reflects the effects of the large fall in the second Quarter of

this year. An annual unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent is in prospect for next year.

For next year, Budget 2021 provides for voted expenditure of €87.8 billion, an increase of 17.4

per cent compared with that envisaged at the beginning of the year.

The main channel through which a disorderly UK exit is expected to impact on the Irish

economy next year is via trade, with tariff and non-tariff barriers weighing on exports, and

thereafter passing through to domestic demand with a lag. A disorderly exit also results in

lower activity in the UK and elsewhere, further reducing the demand for Irish exports. The

impact on the more traditional manufacturing sectors could be severe, especially if tariff and

non-tariff measures on their UK-sourced intermediate inputs led to production shortages. The

impact on exports from the multinational sector is assumed to be fairly modest, as these are

less reliant on the UK market and less responsive to short-term fluctuations in global demand

– the current very strong growth in exports of pharmaceuticals and computer services being

a case-in-point. In aggregate terms, export growth of 1 per cent is expected next year, around

4 percentage points below what would be expected under a deal scenario.

Against this exceptionally difficult backdrop, National Budget 2021 is designed to limit the

economic fall-out from the pandemic and from the severe bilateral trade disruption with the

UK. At an aggregate level, the shortfall in private demand will be partly offset by increased

public demand: public expenditure will exceed revenue by 5.7 per cent of GDP next year, with

the gap being financed by additional public sector borrowing. In monetary terms, this

amounts to a budget deficit of around €20½ billion next year.

More specifically, National Budget 2021 involves a (net) budgetary package of around €17¾

billion, the majority of which is being allocated to expenditure. Capital expenditure under the

National Development Plan will increase to over €10 billion, the largest amount that has ever

been allocated to public capital spending. COVID-related expenditure will amount to €8½

billion, while a ‘recovery fund’ – including for Brexit-contingency purposes – is being

established, as provided for in the *Programme for Government.*

**Local Outlook:**

At the start of 2020, all indicators were showing that our local economy was growing and

performing well. Limerick’s internationalisation was continuing with a new brand launched

to help win further indigenous and foreign investment and reflect our resurgence as a thriving

economic and visitor destination.

In March, everything changed as COVID-19 spread across the world and caused

unprecedented disruption. The pandemic has brought the fastest and deepest contraction in

the national and local economy since the financial crisis.

At its peak, 45% of workers in the City and County were reliant on the Pandemic

Unemployment Payment (PUP) or Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).

Reflecting the national lockdown, passenger numbers through Shannon Airport fell by 99%

with huge knock-on impacts for tourism and commerce across the Mid-West. Combined with
---
9

restrictions on mobility, footfall in Limerick City Centre collapsed by over 80% compared to

normal levels during the Lockdown in early Summer.

In response to the pandemic and its effects on the business community, the Council

implemented its COVID Recovery Plan providing crucial support to local businesses through

the Restart Grant and Restart Grant Plus with up to €25,000 in direct cash payments for those

impacted by COVID-19. Limerick Local Enterprise Office assisted local businesses with over

€3m in grant aid, business continuity grants worth €1.25m and over €0.5m in online trading

vouchers.

Through its digital platform Limerick.ie, the Local Authority launched a free virtual

marketplace called Limerick.ie/Shop to help retailers trade while their doors were closed, and

connect Limerick consumers with local suppliers for their shopping needs. Together with a

promotional ‘Shop Limerick, Save Livelihoods’ campaign, the initiative went live three weeks

after the decision to create the online platform was made. On Limerick.ie/Shop, the public

could browse and buy from home-grown Limerick businesses, buy a local business voucher,

find out about local neighbourhood food deliveries or where they can order a take-out from

a favourite restaurant.

More than 230 businesses across the City and County signed up and more are still joining,

with a Christmas 2020 marketing campaign imminent. The Council also ran a very successful

domestic tourism marketing campaign, including 50 reasons to visit Limerick City and County

in 2020 to encourage people living in other regions to staycation in Limerick during Summer

2020.

Limerick City and County Council established a COVID-19 Community Response Team - a

strong network of over 1,700 committed volunteers ready to deal with calls and referrals and

provide a wide range of support to those in need. An operations centre was set up with a

freephone “Community Call” number, open 8am–8pm, 7 days a week. At the height of the

restrictions, Limerick’s Community Call was dealing with almost 1,000 calls a week from older

and vulnerable citizens.

Addressing physical and mental health wellbeing continues to be a key focus for the Local

Authority, with the Library Services partnering with local mental health and community health

care services to provide books and other materials to patients in acute units at hospitals, and

to care facilities for vulnerable people to support positive mental health during isolation. In

addition to support for older people and medically vulnerable people, the Local Authority

introduced a series of measures to help encourage more cycling and walking, all adhering to

the public health guidelines as part of the COVID-19 mobility plan. Certain streets were closed

to vehicular traffic at certain times during the week to encourage active transport and provide

more space for outdoor activities, and traffic was reduced on other routes on a pilot basis.
---
10

Parklets were built, outdoor dining facilitated and new cycle lanes introduced to encourage

more sustainable modes of transport.

Limerick City and County Council’s response throughout 2020, and as we face into 2021, is

aimed at building future resilience and strengthening interagency linkages and partnerships

that will be maintained in the future. In our local economy, there are now signs of recovery.

The number of workers accessing income subsidies has fallen significantly from peak and

activity is recovering slowly in the retail sector. Pre the introduction of Level 5 restrictions in

October 2020, footfall in the City Centre was just 22% off its pre-pandemic levels. As remote

working becomes more attractive, a network of co-working spaces across the Mid-West will

launch in December 2020 as a response to this.

Consolidation rather than growth is a key focus as we prepare for 2021. After a projected

contraction this year due to the impact from COVID-19, the economy should rebound as

global demand recovers. Fiscal stimulus and liquidity-boosting measures should also support

a rebound in domestic activity. A prolonged health crisis and a potential no-deal Brexit cloud

the outlook, however.

We look forward to brighter days ahead in 2021 when we hope that public health measures

ease and Limerick can slowly get back to normal. Limerick City and County Council is spending

nearly €10m in the immediate term on sustainable transport projects, while the Limerick-

Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy provides a long-term roadmap for sustainable

mobility in the City and County. The COVID-19 crisis has brought great challenges but there

are also opportunities to re-imagine Limerick and its economy as we move into the recovery

phase. Limerick’s €180m Project Opera is set to finally get underway, master planning

commences for the Cleeves Site and the re-development of O’Connell Street is set to bring

significant improvements to the City Centre.

The creation and retention of employment and enterprise diversification in the Limerick

region continues to be a priority and the Council will continue to use its resources and

property assets to facilitate job creation next year. The Council is confident that overall

investment in Limerick will continue to grow during 2021.

**Budget Strategy and Objectives**

The Draft Budget has been prepared on the principle of a “balanced budget” based on the

overall level of resources available to the Council and the requirement to meet statutory,

contractual, legal and other obligations. It incorporates the decisions made by the Council in

relation to the Local Property Tax and General Municipal/Metropolitan Allocations. Under the

Local Government Act, 2001 as amended, the Draft Budget is required to set out the

expenditure necessary to carry out the functions of the Council and the income estimated to

accrue to the Council.

**Outturn 2020**

In presenting the Annual Budget for the year ending 31 December 2021 to Council, I wish to

take this opportunity to summarise the financial position of Limerick City and County Council.

The Annual Financial Statement of Limerick City and County Council for the year 2019 shows

the accumulated balance on the Revenue Account is in a credit position of €833,703. I have

reviewed the up-to-date position and I am satisfied that every effort will be made to break-

even on the Revenue Account for 2020 despite challenges faced by the Council with the

COVID-19 global pandemic; however there is pressure on a number of income heads and

ongoing controls on expenditure are in place. The impact of the windfarm appeals has been

highlighted to members during 2019 and this could impact adversely in achieving a balanced

outturn. The 2021 draft Budget reflects the need to continue a strong financial management

ethos while making every effort to meet the ever-increasing demands on the services of

Limerick City and County Council.

**Analysis of Expenditure Requirements 2021**

The total estimated expenditure included in the Draft Budget for 2021 amounts to €857.234

million, an increase of €31.83 million on the adopted figure for 2020. The growth in the HAP

transactional Shared Service Centre accounts for the majority of this increase. As this

expenditure is matched by an increase in corresponding income, it has no net effect on the

Budgetary Provisions. The following Table 2 depicts Revenue expenditure by Division.

**Chart 4: Analysis of Income: Draft Budget 2021 v’s Budget 2020**

**Goods and Services Income**

Good and Services income, excluding HAP income for Draft Budget 2021, is €53.57m and is

noted in Table D. This includes income headings such as income from single differential rent

scheme of €15.95m for Budget 2021 (increase of €950k on Budget 2020). Income from Irish

Water is also accounted for under this heading with Budget 2021 at €12.7m. Other income

sources noted under Goods and Services that are lower than Budget 2020 due to COVID-19

factors include:

 Planning Fees with income of €0.69m noted for Budget 2021 (compared to €0.89m in

Budget 2020).

 Parking Fines and Charges with income of €1.93m noted for Budget 2021 (compared to

€2.38m in 2020).

One key assumption noted in Budget 2021 is that compensation from Central Government

will be received in 2021 for loss of income in Goods and Services due to COVID-19 restrictions

(this compensation is noted under Grants and Subsidies for €1.05m).

**Grants and Subsidies Income**

Grants and Subsidies income, excluding HAP income for Draft Budget 2021, is €65.28m and is

noted in Table E. Some of the key income sources under this heading include:

 Road Grants are assumed to remain at 2020 levels.

 Assumption that compensation from Central Government will be received in 2021 for loss

of income in Goods and Services due to COVID-19 restrictions (Parking Fines and Charges,

Planning Fees): €1.05m.

 Compensation for increases in rates of pay and PSPR resulting from the unwinding of

FEMPI legislation and increases in pay and pensions relating to the Public Sector Stability

Agreement noted at €5.1m in Draft Budget 2021 (increase of €0.83m compared to 2020

due to pay increases in 2020).

It is important to acknowledge recent correspondence received from Minister Darragh

O’Brien TD and Minister Peter Burke TD outlining the Government’s support for the Local

Government Sector, both in terms of delivery of Government priorities and particularly in

respect of the exceptional leadership shown through the response to the COVID-19

pandemic. The correspondence further outlined that “in the context of the 2021 budget

process,” the Ministers “would ask that Elected Members be mindful of the significant

commitments made and fulfilled by Government in 2020 and to carry forward the

aforementioned constructive approach to your budget adoption process.” A full copy of this

correspondence is available in *Appendix 1* of this report.

**Local Property Tax Allocation 2021**

Local Property Tax (LPT) is now a key funding source for Local Government replacing the

General Purpose Grant funding allocation. The initial allocation under this funding heading

was confirmed as €17,554,464. The basis of this funding is an allocation of 80% of the LPT

collected from property owners in the City and County and retained by the Local Authority,

with the remaining 20% being paid into an equalisation fund from which payments are made

to Counties not achieving a level of funding equivalent to the 2013 General Purpose Grant

(GPG) through their own LPT receipts.

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 and associated Regulations permits the Members of

the Council to vary the Rate by a maximum increase or decrease of 15%. The Council decided

to adjust the LPT rate upwards by 15% in 2021 equating to an increase of €2,389,912.

The 2021 allocation from the Local Property Tax and the calculation provided by the DHPLG

on the basis of this allocation is set out in ***Table 4*** below:

**Commercial Rates**

Commercial Rates is a significant contributor to the total budgeted income for the Council

and it is vital to the level of service delivery that income from this source is maximised. In this

respect, it is critically important that the Valuation Office reverts promptly with new

valuations during 2021. Limerick City and County Council will continue to ensure that all

commercial properties in the City and County are included on the rates records and are

properly rated.

Due to COVID-19, 2020 has been a very challenging year for the Council’s Ratepayers. But

supports from Central Government (listed below) have aided businesses:

 **Restart Grant:** Equivalent to the Rates Bill for 2019 with a minimum payment of

€2,000 and maximum payment of €10,000.

 **Restart Grant Plus:** Equivalent to the Rates Bill for 2019 with a minimum payment of

€4,000 and maximum payment of €25,000.

 **30% Additional Top-Up Payment.**

 **9 Month Rates Waiver.**

 **Local Authority support schemes (SME and Tourism).**

The Valuation Office carried out a full revaluation of commercial properties in Limerick City

and County areas in 2014. The principal of the revaluation process exercise was that it is

revenue neutral ((i.e. no financial loss or gain to the Local Authority). Limerick City and County

Council has, however, experienced significant erosion of its commercial rates income as a

result of these appeals with a loss to date of €1.18m per annum. There are six outstanding

appeals from Windfarms to be adjudicated by the Valuation Tribunal which could result in

further financial losses from reduced Commercial Rates of €600k per annum (arrears of
---
20

€3.5m), bringing potential losses to €1.7m per annum. Limerick City and County Council is

the first Local Authority to object to a decision of the Valuation Tribunal.

This financial loss in Commercial Rates for 2021 due to the windfarms’ appeals has been partly

mitigated by the Council receiving some Rates buoyancy in Commercial Rates rather than as

compensation from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

**Vacant Property Scheme 2021**

Section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives the power to the Members of

Local Authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual Local Electoral Areas

within the overall administrative area of the Local Authority.

Article 29 of the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014

provides that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be decided at the statutory annual

Budget Meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant Local Electoral

Area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the Budget relates. The Budget has

been framed on the basis of the refund rates on vacant property noted in ***Table 6*** below.

The following amended vacant property scheme is proposed to continue in 2021:

**Band**

**% Refund**

Up to €2,856 Annual Rate Demand

100%

€2,857 to €11,376 Annual Rate Demand (with payment

of 50% required)

50%

€11,377 to €57,024 Annual Rate Demand (with

payment of 75% required)

25%

Over €57,025 Annual Rate Demand (with payment of

90% required)

10%

**Table 6: Proposed Vacant Property Scheme 2021**

**Small and Medium Business Support Scheme 2021 (SME Scheme)**

The proposed Small and Medium Business Support Scheme will pay a financial support to

occupiers of commercial properties with a total annual commercial rate bill of up to and

including €25,000 but not less than €1 in 2021. The proposed % support for 2021 rates is 9%,

subject to a maximum refund of €1,000 which will be subject to a number of terms and

conditions, including 25% of arrears must be paid in year 1 to qualify for the scheme with a

payment plan in place over years 2 to 4 for the remaining arrears.
---
21

**Tourism Sector Support Scheme 2021**

The Proposed Tourism Sector Support Scheme for 2021 will be a financial support/reduction

to occupiers of commercial properties directly linked to the Tourism Sector. In order to

qualify, the total annual Commercial Rates liability must be in excess of €25,000 (Businesses

with a Rate Demand less than €25,000 already qualify for the SME Scheme 2021) and is

subject to a number of terms and conditions. The support grant payment, which is aimed

specifically at the Tourism and Hospitality Sector, will be set at 4% of the total Rates, including

arrears, up to a maximum grant payment of €5,000 for 2021, subject to the Scheme being

approved by the Council.

**Business and Retail Incentive Scheme 2021**

The Proposed Business and Retail Incentive Scheme for 2021 will continue to be available for

businesses in all towns and villages across Limerick City and County Council. The scheme is

intended to address property vacancy rates, improve streetscapes and to support the

business community.

**Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Transactional Shared Service Centre**

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is the principal platform for underpinning the

provision of housing support in Ireland. HAP is a form of social housing support provided by

all Local Authorities under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. The availability

of HAP enables all Local Authorities to provide housing support to over 58,000 households

with a long-term housing need, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients.

The key business processes delivered on behalf of the Local Authorities by the HAPSSC are (1)

Tenancy Processing, (2) Weekly Tenant Rent Run, (3) Monthly Landlord Payment, (4) Tax

Clearance Certificate Compliance, (5) Tenancy Amendments, (6) Debt Management, (7)

Recoupment Management and (8) Stakeholder Reporting.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HAPSSC has continued to support over 58,000 active HAP

tenancies and minimised risks that could result in a disruption of the services offered by the

Scheme.

The HAPSSC will process circa 15,000 new tenancies in 2021 and process €659 million in

payments to HAP landlords and collect €156 million in differential rent from HAP tenants. The

HAP Shared Services Centre is ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System certified.

**General Municipal/Metropolitan Allocation 2021**

Circular Fin 08/2015 referred to the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)

(Amendment) Regulations (S.I.363 of 2015), which amends the Local Government (Financial

and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 by providing that the Meeting at which
---
22

Municipal/Metropolitan Members consider the draft budgetary plan must conclude no later

than 10 days prior to the Local Authority Budget Meeting.

Following the adoption of the Budget, a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and

repairs to be carried out during 2021 in each Municipal/Metropolitan District will be prepared

for consideration and adoption by the Municipal/Metropolitan District Members.

The draft Budget has included a general Municipal/Metropolitan allocation of €1.403m in

total for District Members, which will provide a focus and clarity as regards how the Elected

Members want to account for the expending of monies within their area.

**Workforce**

Recruitment of staff within the Organisation will continue and, in particular, will focus on the

replacement of staff following retirements, promotions and departures.

As a major employer in the region, it is important that we provide employment opportunities

to the communities we serve. The Graph below shows our overall numbers at present and

the number of retired staff, which will rise significantly towards the end of 2020.

**Chart 5: Analysis of staff numbers and number receiving pensions 2015-2020**

**Business Improvement Department**

Our Public Service 2020 provided a policy framework to build on previous reforms and

Limerick City and County Council has a dedicated Business Improvement Team to embed this

framework into our Organisation. The Business Improvement Department provides support

to the Organisation in the assessment of service delivery for efficiency and effectiveness. The

Team assists in mapping and standardising processes ensuring the Organisation is producing

value for money services that provide the best customer experience.

Involving the public in the design of their services is key in producing accessible services.

Customer engagement is sought online and during citizen feedback sessions and it is this

citizen participation that will continue to shape our services.

Data is also critical in informing our ability to make evidence-based decisions. Our internal

CRM system is connected to our Service Catalogue which allows the Council to assess the

demand for our services, see where there are gaps and allows the Council to be proactive in

deciding budgets and resource allocation that will meet our citizen demands.

The Human Resource Department, in partnership with Business Improvement Department,

launched an employee communications mobile app “Council Connect” in April of 2020. This

was undertaken as part of the Council’s communication strategy with colleagues during the

current pandemic. The app has provided all colleagues, both office-based and outdoor-based,

with access to diverse information such as COVID-19 policies, HR policies, weather alerts,

Sports and Social information etc.

**Irish Water**

The Budget provides for the ongoing Service Level Agreement (SLA) arrangements with Irish

Water as Limerick City and County Council provides water services on behalf of the national

Water Authority. The Budget includes provision for the expenditure associated with the

operation of the SLA and for the recoupment of these costs from Irish Water.

**Capital Budget 2021-2023**

In accordance with Section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local

Government Reform Act 2014, a report is included on the Programme of Capital Projects

proposed by Limerick City and County Council for the three years 2021 to 2023.

A key element of the Capital Programme over the coming years is delivering on the Limerick

2030 Plan. Council Members agreed to the raising of a working capital loan in 2014 of €32m

and in 2017 approved loans of €170m from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Council

of Europe Development Bank to help fund this programme. In 2020, with the commencement

of the Opera Project, the Council requested and received the first drawdown of €25m from

the EIB. Also, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Urban

Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) will provide funding opportunities for the

Council to develop strategic projects.

Given the fact that we are proposing allocations over three years, it would be unrealistic to

suggest that these allocations are definitive, and are subject to funding being available in

future years. Capital projects, by their very nature, are flexible rolling plans which involve an

annual review and possible adjustment. Below is a summary of potential spend and source

of funding for the three-year Capital Plan 2021 to 2023:

**COVID-19**

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Limerick City and County Council has

continued to deliver all essential services to the public.

In March, a COVID Crisis Management Team was established and this group has met regularly

and ensured that the Council’s strategic aims are met. These include following national advice

to contain spread of COVID-19, showing leadership to staff and the public, as well as

protection of the Health, Safety and Welfare of Staff, Councillors and Customers.

The COVID Community Response Team, supported by our Customer Services Department,

provided an invaluable support structure to local communities.

A range of COVID-19 safe work practices have been rolled out and adopted by staff to

minimise the risk of infection. In this regard, continuing to adhere to public health advice is

of utmost importance.

Council Meetings have also adapted to the circumstances with full Council Meetings moving

to Patrickswell Racecourse to ensure adequate social distancing and a safe environment for

staff and Elected Members, while many other Meetings have moved online.

**Directly Elected Mayor**

Mr. Peter Burke TD, Minister of State for Local Government and Planning, received the final

report of the Implementation Advisory Group (IAG) on 22nd October 2020 into the

establishment of the role of Directly Elected Mayor with executive functions for Limerick City

and County. In arriving at its report, the Group, which is representative of the main

stakeholders in Limerick and was chaired by Mr. Tim O’Connor, consulted widely with the

business community, academic institutions, public service providers, and community and

political representatives in Limerick.

The Minister has indicated that the report, along with legislative proposals, will be submitted

for consideration by Government in the coming weeks and to the Oireachtas shortly

thereafter, with a view to the holding of a Mayoral Election in Limerick in 2021. No budgetary

provision has been made in the 2021 budget for a Directly Elected Mayor on the basis that

the report recommended that any additional mandate must also have additional means to

deliver.

**Conclusion**

The Council, since its inception in 2014, has positioned itself as an ambitious, innovative

proactive and engaged Organisation to serve the people of Limerick. The transition to a

Directly Elected Mayor with executive powers is a fundamental change in Local Government

and will again require significant cultural change within the Organisation.

The proposed Draft Budget for 2021 will maintain existing services to a high standard and

ensure that Limerick City and County Council fulfils its statutory and regulatory obligations.

The demand for services across Limerick continues to grow and this is matched by an increase

in public expectation. Our Customer Service is connected to our service catalogue, which

allows us to access the demand for services, see where the gaps are and allow us to be

proactive in allocating budgets and staffing levels that align with our citizen demands.

Limerick City and County Council will also facilitate economic development by progressing key

capital projects, including Urban and Village Renewal, while also marketing Limerick as a great

place to live, visit and do business.

During 2020, the Council again had to react to unforeseen events such as the COVID-19 global

pandemic, which demonstrated the professionalism, commitment and determination of staff

to manage the impact of these events.

The crisis highlighted the true nature of public service in communities across Limerick. Faced

with the challenge of social distancing, and with many of our staff working from home, we

had to deliver support and bring novel solutions to complex problems posed by the new

realities of Lockdown.

With the strategic direction of our newly launched Limerick brand clear, it acted as a

springboard to unite Limerick and it became the impetus behind the highly successful local

initiatives we ran during Lockdown. Moreover, unity was vital as we sought to protect the

small businesses at the heart of our communities.

Again, it was a partnership approach and a clear vision that let us move quickly and an

engaged community has given us the clarity, focus and energy to move forward and make a

difference.

And, I believe, it is this united confidence, sense of identity and momentum that forecasts a

brighter future for Limerick as we plan for 2021.

The draft 2021 Budget has been prepared with no proposed increase in Commercial Rates

ARV (Annual Rate on Valuation), and reflects the decision by Elected Members to increase

rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) to keep at the 2020 level. This increase will enable the Council

to further improve service delivery.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and the Elected Members for their

assistance and support, particularly the Members of the Corporate Policy Group, in preparing

this Budget.

I also wish to express my appreciation to the Management Team and their own teams for

their commitment and hard work in preparing this document. The coming year will again be

challenging, but it will offer significant opportunities.

I look forward to the full support of the Members at the Statutory Budget Meeting to be held

Friday, 27th November, 2020.’

The Deputy Chief Executive then provided an overview of the Budget including an overview

of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the corresponding Capital programmes.
---
27

Following the Deputy Chief Executives overview of the Budget, the Mayor confirmed that this

concluded the review of all Divisions within the Revenue Account and the Members would be

afforded the opportunity for questions and answers in relation to each division. The Mayor

confirmed that this concluded the review of all Divisions within the Revenue Account. He then

asked for a Proposer for the draft Budget, as presented.

**Councillor Sheahan (J)**

Councillor Sheahan (J), speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Group, thanked and commended

Mr Coughlan and his team for the work that had gone in to the preparation of the Budget. He

commended the Executive of the Council for their work over the Covid pandemic and he

commended the people of Limerick, and in particular the elderly, for their resilience during

the worst health and economic crisis the modern world has experienced. He commended the

Elected Members for the work they have done on behalf of the people of Limerick as they are

the front line political workers of this nation. He stated that today a balanced budget was

presented by the Executive which has been made easier to balance by supports received in

the form of National Grants towards the waiving of the rates etc., the brave decision by

members on the Local Property Tax but a warning needs to be voiced that all the supports in

place by the Government for the pandemic cost the nation €30 billion, €23 billion of which is

borrowed in 2020 and, depending on bounce back rates, another €20billion of extra debt is

forecast for 2021.

Councillor Sheahan stated that the budget today has protected the Council’s service delivery

to the people and, while we have had to trim monies from the likes of the festival funds, we

have increased the allocation for housing maintenance/improvement - €744,000, estate

management - €170,000, own resources for the homeless - €170,000 and Maintained Housing

Adaption Grants. There is an increased Roads budget which is mainly funded by the

Exchequer. The Government has an increased capital budget of up to €10billion, the biggest

ever to date. Public lighting has also increased from €3.14m to €3.38m and rising which, in

his opinion, is an area that needs a rethink. He welcomed the increase in the budget for the

fire service by €600,000 and the maintenance of the bin waiver at €330,000.

Councillor Sheahan stated that areas that need to be addressed is the housing maintenance

budget, the regeneration budget and the NDP Review and City and County Development Plan.

He stated that Minister McGrath has called for a review of financing NDP and the lack of

finance has failed every NDP. He added that Covid 19 has changed work practices and the

anti-rural policies need to be reversed. On behalf of the Fine Gael Group, he formally

proposed the Draft Budget as presented.

**Councillor O’Hanlon**

Councillor O’Hanlon, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil party, welcomed the budget and

commended Sean Coughlan and his team for this highly commended budget. He welcomed

the fact that there has been no increase in rates which is supporting the business community

in the city and county and welcomed the non-increase in LPT. He stated that the Elected

Representatives have been elected by the public to make the right decisions on their behalf

in the provision of services. Some decisions are not popular and many difficult decisions had

to be made over the years.

Councillor O’Hanlon stated that every councillor is inundated with requests from people for

housing. The Council has embarked on a very ambitious housing programme which he is very

proud of. The investment on housing will provide an important stimulus to the local economy

through support for local suppliers and provision of employment. He welcomed the increase

in the budget for housing maintenance and the increased resources in the area of

homelessness but said he would have liked to have seen an increase in the Housing

Adaptation Grant of €630,000 which is the same as last year.

Councillor O’Hanlon referred to the very ambitious road projects which have been embarked

on and welcomed the increase in the roads budget by €4.89m year on year leading to a total

budget for 2021 of €49.14m.  He stated that he was delighted to see preparations for the

commencement of work on the Opera Centre Site with planned expenditure of €6.61m for

2021. He welcomed the continuation of the Leader Programme with planned expenditure of

€3.875m in 2021. He welcomed the planned expenditure of €1.757m on the Town and Village

Renewal Scheme and the University of Limerick to Montpelier greenway. He said he would

like to see a greenway being developed from the city out to Annacotty.

He noted that the main changes in the Revenue Budget 2021 for environment were increases

– an increase of €600,000 for the operation of the fire service and Waste Waiver Scheme that

remained the same as the budget for 2020 at €0.33m. He also noted some key capital projects

in the three-year capital budget for recreation and amenity including development of the

regional athletics hub – Newcastle West with €1.2m expenditure planned for 2021 and the

planned upgrade works to various library buildings.

Councillor O’Hanlon said that members of the public do not know about the huge array of

services which Limerick City and County Council provide and the Council should advertise

itself more. He referred to the GMA funds which are very important and gives the councillors

an opportunity to provide small amounts of funding to various community groups. On behalf

of the Fianna Fail Party, he formally seconded the proposal to adopt the Budget for 2021.

**Councillor Teefy**

On behalf of the Independent Group, Councillor Teefy thanked Sean Coughlan, his team and

all involved for the work they have done in presenting a balanced budget in the most difficult

of years and for Sean’s availability during the week. There were many challenges facing the

world this year with the worst pandemic in a hundred years yet, despite these unprecented

times, the Council managed to get through it very well and carry out the works Programme

and continue to provide all the necessary services. She commended management and all its

staff for their hard work and commitment. She also commended the voluntary organisations

and relevant individuals involved in Covid 19 Community Response led by Council staff and

she expressed her heartfelt thanks and appreciation to all front line staff.

She stated that Limerick is the second largest local authority spend and this is the second year

that the Council’s budget including revenue and capital exceed €1 billion to €1.11 billion.  She

welcomed the significant investment in housing and building projected in the three year

capital budget which will provide an important stimulus to the local economy. She welcomed

the continued provision for housing maintenance which has seen an increase of €744,000 for

2021 and the provision of Housing Adaption Grants maintained at 2020 levels at €630,000.

The appointment of Estate Management / Community Sustainment Officers during the year

is also welcome.

Councillor Teefy welcomed the continued investment in the Roads infrastructure in Limerick

city and county with key projects such as the N/M20 Cork to Limerick Scheme and the Foynes

to Limerick Road Improvement Scheme and many others. She welcomed the roads revenue

budget stating that local and regional roads are so important and it is essential that they are

maintained and also the continued resources made available from the Local Property Tax

which has allowed additional investment in roads/footpaths and new plant machinery of

€778,000 and additional provisions for street cleaning of €220,000.

Dealing with dereliction in many of our villages and towns is very essential and key capital

projects noted under economic development for 2021 includes Town and Village Renewal

Scheme. The €2.5m rural regeneration allocation of funding for the five towns and villages

will bring the derelict buildings back into reuse. She welcomed the continued investment in

tourism projects including the Greenway projects and Lough Gur improvement works and

welcomed the commencement of construction works on the Operate Site Development early

in 2021.

Councillor Teefy recognised the important role of the fire services with a sizeable budget of

€16.6m and the Munster Regional Control Centre with €2.5m planned expenditure for 2021.

She also referred to the Library service and the important role it plays in our community, the

maintenance of parks and open spaces and the different programmes in Arts and Culture.

She welcomed the fact that there was no increase in commercial rates in 2021 and stressed

the importance of continuing to support businesses during these uncertain times of Covid 19

and Brexit and would encourage similar Government supports and interventions in 2021

which are so important for the businesses impacted. She stated that the Independent Group

would be supporting the budget.

**Councillor Leddin**

Councillor Leddin, on behalf of the Labour Party, stated that the Labour Party would also be

supporting the Budget for 2021. He acknowledged the work done in the preparation of the

budget which is very readable and easy to understand and thanked Sean Coughlan and all

involved. He referred to the budget for HAP which several years ago was €10m and which is

now €659m. He said the amount of money spent on HAP is very concerning and this money

would be better spent on the provision of social and affordable housing. As a society HAP

numbers should be decreasing and housing stock should be increasing. He stated that 67%

of the Council’s budget is raised locally so is within the Elected Members control to decide

how it is spent. He said LPT is a key component of the Council’s budget. He said core public

services are being protected and added that the Labour Party never took a selective approach

to social housing. He welcomed the allocation for dealing with the homeless and said the

Council should adopt zero voids. He welcomed the additional housing grants and said the

Council were very progressive on Compulsory Purchase Orders and were utilising this

legislation and working with owners of sites in addressing dereliction.

**Councillor Benson**

Councillor Benson stated that it was an honour for her to speak on behalf of the Sinn Féin

Party at this budget meeting. She said that this has been a very challenging year for everybody

and added that this Council is only as strong as its staff and under such peculiar and

challenging circumstances, the staff have done an amazing job. She particularly referenced

the Council’s Finance team and thanked them for their patience, professionalism and

assistance they have offered over this past week.

She said, given the current economic climate, it was encouraging to see funding levels for

essential services maintained. She welcomed the resources that have been allocated for

housing maintenance, traveller accommodation and estate management, a focus in the area

of estate management was long overdue and the introduction of the tenancy sustainment

teamthis year has proved a successful innovation. She added that more needs to be done in

this area and expressed hope that the additional funding can be used to support their

important work.

Councillor Benson stated that the housing crisis in this county has not gone away. The list of

people who require housing assistance remains extremely high, whilst the Council’s housing

stock remains incredibly low. She stated there is a profound shortage of housing

across Limerick. She said the budget makes reference to delivering on targets as set out in

Rebuilding Ireland, however, Rebuilding Ireland has failed. The Country is five years into this

crisis and homelessness and the need for emergency shelters remains as high now as it did

then. This is a scar that cannot heal with the aid of a temporary plaster. She referred to the

budget of €2m which has been earmarked for the RAS Scheme and added that, while RAS has

its merits, additional funding should not be allocated to private landlords but rather it be

directed towards a sustainable public housing stock. The Council needs to progress I’s capital

projects so that they can be delivered in a timely fashion and pointed out that too many

housing projects have been delayed and referred particularly to the unfulfilled projects

in Moyross and Clonmacken.

Councillor Benson welcomed the additional funding for homeless services which remains a

huge problem for the city and county. Twenty-four hour homeless accommodation is needed

with nobody having to walk the streets or feel the need to decamp in a doorway. She said

that, while the Council is responsible for the accommodation, she repeated the calls for the

HSE to work in conjunction with the Council in providing wrap around supports that are vitally

needed.

Councillor Benson referred to the excellent work that has been done by the Limerick Council

Marketing Team and referred specifically to The Shop Local and the Limerick Online Directory

Projects which have been very successful and welcomed the additional funding allocated to

this work. She said the business owners themselves have demonstrated a high level of

innovation and flexibility over these last few months and without their efforts many of the

towns and villages would be much darker and lonelier places. She also commended the Local

Enterprise Office for the support they have offered SMEs during this time of hardship and

welcomed the increase in their funding.

She said the Kings Island Flood Relief Scheme must be treated as a priority in the coming year

and there can be no more repeats of flooding. She stressed the importance of the Coonagh

/ Knockalisheen Road project, without which the Northside will remain a cul de sac devoid of

economic enhancement.

Councillor Benson expressed extreme reservations in relation to the Bin Waiver Scheme.

Despite an increase of €70,000 for the Scheme less people were able to avail of the Scheme

in 2020 due to a closing date of 31st January. She pointed out that councillors have received

three difference figures regarding the no. of applications for bin waivers and asked for

clarification on this. She said while she had some reservations about aspects of the 2021

budget and that there are some important questions that need to be answered, the

Sinn Féin team on this Council would be voting in favour of this budget.

**Councillor Hartigan**

Councillor Hartigan, on his own behalf and on behalf of the Green Party, welcomed the budget

for 2021 and commended all involved in balancing the budget considering the restraints of

Covid 19. He thanked the Chief Executive, Directors and Management team for the work they

did in preparing the budget and for engaging with councillors during the process. He also

commended them for their work in supporting communities and businesses during the

pandemic. He said the Green Party were pleased to see continued and increased spending

on social and affordable housing, housing maintenance, infrastructure for sustainable travel

and environmental protection. He added that provision of social and affordable housing is

urgently required and stressed the importance of maintaining current stock. He said the

Green Party would like to see a future where there would be less reliance on HAP and RAS

and more emphasis placed on building social and affordable housing by the Council.

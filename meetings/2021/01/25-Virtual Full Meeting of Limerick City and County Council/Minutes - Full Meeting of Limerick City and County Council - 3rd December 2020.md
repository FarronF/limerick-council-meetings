Circulated, report of the Meetings Administrator dated 18th November, 2020,

The Council was being asked to consider amending Standing Orders to allow for

Supplementary Standing Orders regulating the proceedings in relation to remote meetings of

the Council’ and S.I. No. 445/2020 – ‘Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions)

Act 2020 (Section 29) (Local Authorities) (Designation) Order 2020.’

Proposed by Councillor Ryan (E);

Seconded by Councillor O’Brien;

And Resolved:

“That, Standing Orders of Limerick City and County Council be amended to allow for

remote meetings to be held, in accordance with Local Government Circular LG 07-2020

‘Guidelines for Supplementary Standing Orders regulating the proceedings in relation to

remote meetings of the Council’ and S.I. No. 445/2020 – ‘Civil Law and Criminal Law

(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 (Section 29) (Local Authorities) (Designation) Order

2020.”

In the discussion that followed, Councillor Sheahan (J) requested a sunset clause to

allow the ‘remote meetings’ section of Standing Orders to be reviewed in July 2021. The

Mayor agreed to this review.

Consideration of Amendment to Standing Orders – Monthly Meetings

Circulated, report of the A/Senior Executive Officer, Corporate Services, Governance

and Customer Serviced dated 27th November, 2020, in relation to proposal to amend Standing

Orders in light of Motion from Councillor Keary that Meetings of the Council would be held

monthly instead of bi-monthly:

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Keary expressed the opinion that bi-monthly

Meetings were not sufficient to deal with the business of the Full Council. He also questioned

the effectiveness of the Municipal Districts system. He further expressed concern at the delay

in Motions reverting to Full Council when they were referred to Strategic Policy Committees

and also the limit of one Motion per Councillor at Full Council Meetings.

Councillor Galvin seconded the Motion.

The Meetings Administrator then went through his report as circulated, outlining the

issues therein.
---

Members referred to the current workload and number of meetings that they were

attending and also the changes introduced by the Local Government Reform Act 2014

allowing certain statutory business to be discussed at the monthly Municipal and

Metropolitan District Meetings. In the discussion that followed, it was highlighted that should

the bi-monthly Meeting agenda not be completed within the current time restrictions, the

Meeting could be adjourned in order to complete the agenda; furthermore, a Special Meeting

of the Council could also be called for urgent business if required.

There was broad support across all Parties for the continuation of the system of

Council Meetings that was currently operating.

Based on the support for the current system of Meetings, Councillor Keary agreed to

withdraw his Motion.

(e)

Consideration of Amendment to Standing Orders – Live Streaming of

Meetings

Circulated, report of the A/Senior Executive Officer, Corporate Services, Governance

and Customer Services dated 27th November, 2020, in relation to proposal to amend Standing

Orders in light of Motion from Councillor O’Donovan to introduce live streaming of Meetings.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan referred to the other Local Authorities

that were currently live-streaming. She referred to the need for greater openness and citizen

engagement in Council business and that live streaming of Meetings would facilitate this, and

requested that her Motion be put to the floor for a vote.

The Mayor referred to Councillor O’Donovan’s comments on social media and clarified

that the Corporate Policy Group did not make a decision to reject the Motion, that no decision

had been made on the Motion and that he had agreed at the CPG meeting that,

notwithstanding the differing opinions, he was satisfied to allow it to go before the Members

for a decision. He then asked Councillor O’Donovan to remove her incorrect comments on

social media to the effect that the Corporate Policy Group, of which he was the Chair, had

rejected live-streaming.

Councillor O’Hanlon referred to previous comments about ‘old men’ on Social Media

by Councillor O’Donovan which he considered to be unacceptable and requested an apology

for the comments. Councillor O’Donovan explained that she had already apologised for these

comments.

Councillor Ryan (E) seconded the Motion.

The Meetings Administrator then read out the report that accompanied this agenda

item in which he highlighted the annual cost, the viewership figures from the four Local

Authorities that currently had a live-streaming service, and the defamation/litigation issues.
---
10

In the discussion that followed, it was broadly agreed that the matter of live-streaming

should be looked into further and that, as well as looking at the technological options, further

clarification was also needed in respect of defamation/qualified privilege for Members.

Councillor Sheahan (J) proposed that the recommendation in the report, as authored

by the Meetings Administrator, be amended to allow for legal clarification to be obtained on

the term ‘qualified privilege’ for the Members before making a decision on the Motion. This

was seconded by Councillor Leddin.

Following further discussion, the Mayor called for a vote.

The Meeting Administrator advised that the amended Motion, as proposed by

Councillor Sheahan (J) and seconded by Councillor Leddin, would be voted on first. The result

of the voting was as follows:

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

**I will ask at the next Meeting are housing maintenance schedules on track given the varying**

**levels of COVID-19 restrictions that have been in place since March.**

**REPLY:**

The Housing Maintenance Section has continued to deliver Response

Maintenance during COVID-19. The different level of restrictions imposed

nationally has impacted on the level of service that can be made available to

tenants. The current Level 5 status has resulted in essential repairs only being

undertaken similar to the level of service delivered during the Lockdown

period of COVID-19 in March/April. All other requests for Housing

Maintenance received from tenants are recorded in Sugar CRM for review

when COVID-19 restrictions are eased.
---
17

In the period from January to October 2020, Housing Maintenance has

received 11,161 requests, with 76% of cases resolved to date. No loss of

productivity occurred as direct labour staff were redirected to the work on

vacant units to return houses to stock. The co-operation and understanding

of tenants is greatly appreciated by Limerick City and County Council during

this Level 5 period.

Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe

**I will ask at the next Meeting how many stray horses has Limerick City and County Council**

**REPLY:**

In the period 1st January, 2020, to 23rd November, 2020, 118 horses have been

impounded.

11.

Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson

**I will ask at the next Meeting, in response to a parliamentary question submitted by Deputy**

**Eoin Ó Broin in relation to the average cost of Turnkey acquisitions versus local authority**

**builds, could I get a detailed breakdown of these figures by amount of units and unit size**

**and what is the ceiling cost per unit for Turnkeys in Limerick broken down by unit size.**

**REPLY:**

Due to the commercially sensitive nature of turnkey acquisitions, it is not possible to

comment further on a detailed breakdown of the construction costs tendered. However,

Limerick City and County Council is able to provide a breakdown of approved turnkeys and

verify whether the construction cost of turnkeys are within the Department of Housing, Local

Government and Heritage ceiling costs (Circular 13/2019) as follows:

NOTICES OF MOTION

13.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Brien

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Minister for Transport/National**

**Transport Authority for the phased re-introduction of a freight and passenger service along**

**the Limerick City to Foynes railway line in time for the 2027 Ryder Cup.**
---
19

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Brien emphasised that the railway line was not

being used and should be opened well in time for the 2027 Ryder Cup.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Novak proposed an amended wording as follows:

“That, this Council call on the Minister for Transport/National Transport Authority for

the phased re-introduction of a freight and passenger service along the Limerick City to

Foynes railway line in time for the 2027 Ryder Cup **such that rail can drive development in**

**our City and County**.’

Councillor O’Brien had no objection to this and accordingly the Motion, as amended,

was adopted.

A query was raised as to whether passenger rail would be included in the Limerick

Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (LSMATS) and if the railway line to Foynes

would connect with the Great Southern Greenway. The Director, Physical Development,

replied that discussions were ongoing with Irish Rail and that all possibilities would be

explored.

The cost of the phased re-introduction of a railway line to Foynes was raised and it

was considered that this should be explored before a decision was made.

14.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan (to be referred to the

Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment SPC)

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council assess the possibility**

**of providing a roadside tree maintenance grant scheme. This scheme would provide some**

**financial assistance to communities and groups that undertake roadside tree maintenance**

**and the cutting of overhanging trees to assist landowners in complying with their**

**responsibilities under Section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993.**

It was agreed to refer this Motion to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment

Strategic Policy Committee.

15.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale

(Councillors K. Sheahan, B. Collins, S. Keary, E. O’Brien, J. O’Donoghue, A.

Teskey)

**We will move at the next Meeting for the State to increase central funding for the Local**

**Improvement Schemes, Limerick City and County Council to expedite the list of applicants**

**currently waiting on this Scheme.**

In proposing the Motion, the Members for the Municipal District of Adare-Rathkeale

raised concerns regarding the administration of the scheme and their desire to see the waiting

list reduced to one year.

In seconding the Motion, Councillor Scanlan spoke of the right of landowners to secure

their properties and proposed an amendment to the wording of the Motion as follows:
---
20

*“**We will move at the next Meeting for the State to increase central funding for the*

*Local Improvement Schemes, Limerick City and County Council to expedite the list of*

*applicants currently waiting on the Scheme* ***and to allow those who restrict access to***

***qualify within the terms of the scheme.”***

Councillor Keary, in supporting the Motion, proposed a further amendment as follows:

***“**and that on satisfactory completion of a Local Improvement Project, consideration***

***be given for declaration to Public Road status, subject to the agreement of the***

***landowners concerned.**”***

Councillor Sheahan (J) referred to the City and County Managers’ Land Use and

Transportation Committee that was asked to review the Local Improvements Scheme from

which the Local Improvement Scheme Outline 2020/Revised Scheme was produced. This

document introduced, among other requirements, evidence of agricultural holdings, and a

requirement not to have a gate on an applicant’s road.

Following discussion, the proposed amendments were agreed, with the Motion to

read as follows:

**We will move at the next Meeting for the State to increase central funding for the Local**

**Improvement Schemes and to allow those who restrict access to qualify within the terms**

**of the scheme; and for Limerick City and County Council to expedite the list of applicants**

**currently waiting on this Scheme; and that on satisfactory completion of a Local**

**Improvement Project, consideration be given for declaration to Public Road status, subject**

**to the agreement of the landowners concerned.**

Members also requested that Limerick City and County Council expedite the list of

applicants currently waiting on this Scheme.

Members requested that a Workshop be held on the Community Involvement Scheme

and the Meetings Administrator advised that the relevant staff would be contacted.

16.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan

**I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council write to the Minister**

**for Health, University Hospital Limerick and the HSE requesting the urgent recruitment of a**

**specialist dietician in post for adults with diabetes.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor O’Donovan said she had been requested by her

constituents to write to the Minister to request the urgent recruitment of a specialist dietician

for adults with diabetes and that there was a five-year waiting list in UHL for people with this

condition.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Sheahan (J) and it was unanimously

supported by the Council.

17.

Notice of Motion submitted by the Municipal District of Cappamore-

Kilmallock (Councillors G. Mitchell, P.J. Carey, M. Donegan, J. Egan, E. Ryan,

M. Ryan and B. Teefy

**We will move at the next Meeting that this Council write to the Minister for Housing, Local**

**Government and Heritage requesting that the election of the Directly Elected Mayor of**

**Limerick City and County should coincide with the new term of the incoming Council in**

**2024.**

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Mitchell stated that the plebiscite on the Directly

Elected Mayor carried by a narrow margin and that if Limerick City and County Council wanted

to attract a good candidate, the term for the Directly Elected Mayor should be five years, and

so the first Directly Elected Mayor should coincide with the 2024 Local Elections.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Donegan.

Following discussion and a difference of opinion where it was said that the

understanding was that the Directly Elected Mayor would be in place in 2021, it was agreed

to take a vote on the Motion.

The result of the voting was as follows:

**For**

Councillor Carey, Donegan, Egan, Kilcoyne, Mitchell, O’Dea, O’Donoghue, O’Donovan,

O’Hanlon, Ruddle, Ryan (E), Ryan (M), Scanlan, Sheahan (K), Talukder, Teefy **(16)**

Councillors Benson, Butler, Collins (B), Collins (J), Collins (M), Costelloe, Galvin, Hartigan,

Keary, Kiely, McSweeney, Murphy, Novak, O’Sullivan, Sheahan (J), Sheahan (M). **(16)**

There were no abstentions.

As the vote resulted in a tie, the Mayor exercised his casting vote and voted against

the Motion. Accordingly, the Motion was declared as defeated.

*necessary excavation works to recover the remains of Joe Brady, Daniel Curley, Michael Fagan,*

*Thomas Caffrey and Tim Kelly, in what is commonly known as the Invincibles Yard at*

*Kilmainham Gaol. The bodies of these five members of the Irish National Invincibles lie*

*beneath the paving slabs of the yard where they were executed in 1883 for their part in the*

*Phoenix Park assassinations. The families of the five men are represented by the National*

*Graves Association and the wish of the families is for their relatives to be exhumed from*

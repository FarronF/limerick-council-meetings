We request a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council to discuss the following:

“That, in light of the recent Government announcement on the Rural Development Policy
2021-2025 entitled “Our Rural Future,” and the lack of infrastructure such as sewerage in our
local towns and villages, Limerick City and County Council call on the Minister for Housing,
Local Government and Heritage to maintain the status quo with regard to policy on one-off
rural housing in our County and City Development Plan and that the phrase "social and
economic need" not be included.

We will also call on Irish Water to produce a S-year sewerage treatment plan for County
Limerick.

In addition, we request that this Council consider and draft a policy in relation to cluster
development in rural Limerick.

Clir. Liam Galvin.
Cllr. Tom Ruddle.

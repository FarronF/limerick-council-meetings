the presentation.

**Item 1: Presentation on draft LSMATS following Public Consultation - the National**

**Transport Authority (NTA):**

Mr. Clements gave an outline of the Public Consultation process and confirmed that 112

submissions were received. He went through the issues raised and the action responses

from the NTA, grouped into 11 categories as follows:

**Issues raised:**

**Action Responses:**

out and addressing issues around COVID-19.

-LSMATS will be retested using 2 future demand

scenarios and validated to function in both.

**Consultation and Engagement**

Face to face consultation had to be cancelled

due to Covid-19 restrictions. A second round of

targets. Target for Walking and Cycling for the

LSMA and Limerick City and Suburbs to be put in

LSMATS – Practical and Realistic.

**Delivery**

-The Strategy is a long-term framework, and not

a delivery plan.

-The Final LSMATS will inform the NDP funding

requirements currently under review.

**The Modelling Process**

-Confirmed that NTA modelling was appropriate,

and model is peer reviewed and updated

regularly.

-Further functionality and updates to the model

are now available.

-Additional modelling to be undertaken on Rail,

Covid-19 and a full re-run of LSMATS modelling.

**Vision and Ambition**

There was a vision set out in the LSMATS, which

will be updated with more information drawn

from the MASP.

Highlight some schemes in regeneration area

that are of strategic importance.

improvements – frequency of the 303-bus

service from Moyross to Southill has been

doubled.

11

**City Centre Consolidation**

Clarification required and a more explicit

support for the city centre will form part of a

revised LSMATS.

In conclusion, Mr. Clements confirmed that there has been a lot of strong feedback on the

LSMATS and the NTA has identified a significant mandate in Limerick city and Shannon for a

change in transport culture, which is very positive. He advised that the next steps are for

the NTA to undertake the additional modelling, and that the draft Strategy would go out to

Public Consultation in April/May, with a view to finalising the document in September/

October.

The Chair thanked Mr. Clements for the presentation and opened the floor to questions.

Cllr. Mitchell welcomed the fact that the NTA is consulting with Tipperary County Council and

added that the most important thing facing us in the future is dealing with freight following

Brexit. He will be engaging with Tipperary County Council in relation to the N24 in the context

of getting freight out direct to Europe. He added that this connectivity and connectivity to

Shannon light rail should be added to the presentation as exports are very important for the

economy.

Mr. Bruce Harper asked if the strategy will meet the carbon emission reduction targets to

net-zero by 2050, and also if the new consultation will list the baseline emissions and annual

reduction resulting from the strategy.

Ms. Drake queried if the bus route on O’Connell Street will be reviewed as part of the revised

strategy.

In response to Cllr. Mitchell, Mr. Creegan advised that he was happy to confirm the

engagement with Tipperary County Council. He acknowledged Cllr. Mitchell’s comments on

the importance of dealing with freight for economic growth and this will be considered in the

strategy.

Referring to Mr. Harper’s question, Mr. Creegan confirmed that the strategy will be compliant

with the 2030/2050 emission reduction. It is not clear as yet how the overall emissions targets

are going to be distributed however, confirmed that they will be met in the strategy.

In response to Ms. Drake’s question on the bus route on O’Connell Street, Mr. Clements

advised that the Part VIII was agreed. Mr. Creegan added that he can commit to members

that a more detailed Bus Connects network redesign will be completed, similar to Dublin and

Cork. All bus routes will be re-examined as part of this redesign. Ms. Drake asked if this

commitment can be written into the strategy. Mr. Creegan responded that he would give this

consideration. Ms. Drake added that this is a very important issue for the city in terms of

Limerick being a destination and O’Connell Street is Limerick’s premier street.

Cllr. Leddin echoed Ms. Drake’s sentiments and added that he has concerns regarding the

quantity and frequency of buses going through the main thoroughfare.

Cllr. O’Donovan welcomed the new section in relation to COVID as it is important to

acknowledge changing circumstances. She also welcomed the fact that there will be targets

for walking and cycling as they are important measures to see how the strategy is progressing.

The important thing will be the actual implementation of the plan, as this will show results.

Both Cllr. O’Donovan and Cllr. Butler wished to know who makes up the Limerick Transport

Forum.

Cllr. Collins (J) welcomed the review of the draft LSMATS and wished to add his voice to the

Limerick Pedestrian Network in regard to the bus route on O’Connell Street. He outlined that

Members were advised to vote for Part VIII when it came before them, as it was included in

the LSMATS. He disagreed that a main street in a Georgian city would be used for a bus route,

when there are better alternatives that could be used.

In relation to using existing rail network, Cllr. Collins (J) stated that focusing future

development around stations would be a good thing, and asked what other locations were

considered for stations besides Corbally and Moyross. He also asked if any consideration had

been given to linking the substantial rail infrastructure in the county into the metropolitan

area and to Shannon.

In relation to Cllr. O’Donovan’s comments, Mr. Creegan agreed that this strategy needs to

translate into investment and into projects on the ground.

In response to Cllr. Collins (J) Mr. Creegan stated that the O’Connell St. route was identified

as it is the preferred bus corridor by the NTA. He confirmed that as part of the

implementation process, a more granular examination of the whole network would be

completed as part of the Bus Connects project. He added that it is not unusual in a city that

public transport does go through part of the central areas, as that is where people want to

get to. He acknowledged the different viewpoints.

On the heavy rail system, Mr. Creegan confirmed that 11 different stations in the region

were tested in the first strategy preparation. He confirmed that different scenarios need to

be examined in more detail.

In response to the makeup of the Limerick Transport Forum, Dr. Cahill stated that it is

facilitated by the Chamber to encourage discussion, debate around the LSMATS and is made

up of the following groups:

 Limerick Cycling Campaign

 Georgian Society

 Limerick and Clare Education Training Board

 Shannon Chamber

 The City Centre Trader’s Group

 UL Hospitals Group

She added that the Forum itself did not make a submission, but the individual representatives

would have made submissions through their own organisations.

Cllr. Michael Sheahan referred to the articulated buses in Limerick and stated that they are

tremendously disadvantageous in that they take up the space of two buses, are

uncomfortable to travel in and are dangerous to pedestrians in negotiating bends. Mr.

Creegan stated that a solution is outside the scope of the NTA, as this is a private operator

who is fully licenced and has the appropriate certification for road worthiness. He assured

Cllr. Sheahan that no further carriages can be added due to the regulated maximum length of

18.5-metres approx.

At the request of the Chair Mr. Creegan gave an overview of the public consultation process

in view of COVID-19 and the regulations. He advised that it is anticipated to go to public

consultation around April/May. The NTA will ensure a robust consultation process where

people have the maximum opportunity to contribute however, due to restrictions it is not

possible to define the process at this stage.

Mr. Kennedy thanked all for attending the meeting and for their input into the discussion, and

thanked the NTA representatives individually for the presentation. He added that the NTA has

identified the issues raised, and given a commitment to consider these issues in the revised

document. The Council will work very closely with the NTA over the coming months to

prepare the revised strategy.

**Item 2: Minutes:**

The Minutes of the Meeting of the Travel and Transportation Strategic Policy Committee

held on the 15th December 2020 were proposed by Cllr. O’Donovan, seconded by Cllr. Secas

and adopted.

**Item 3: Question submitted by Ms. Ailish Drake**

“A 25KPH advisory speed limit was introduced in the core city centre and county

towns as part of the Guiding Limerick through Covid Plan. It was proposed that this

would be monitored with a view to a permanent speed limit reduction.

How has it been monitored and what are the outcomes of same?

How will the new limit be voted upon and is there a proposed time frame?”

A response to Question was circulated to all members prior to meeting as follows:

“Limerick City and County Council introduced a 25kph advisory speed limit as part of the

Guiding Limerick through COVID Plan, in the summer of 2020. As the name indicates, this is

not an enforceable speed limit, but has the purpose of encouraging compliance.

It appears to have been successful in achieving its aims to some extent, but it should be noted

that traffic patterns have been significantly impacted by the pandemic restrictions.

It is the Council’s intention to introduce a permanent 30kph speed limit in the core city area

subject to compliance with relevant departmental guidelines and the relevant

procedures/consultation will take place later this year with a view to introducing the new limit

on successful completion of these procedures.

As regards our county towns, the process of introducing amended speed limits is complicated

by the presence of national and regional roads running through or close to the core of some

of the towns, for example Adare, Newcastle West, Abbeyfeale and Kilmallock. It may be more

appropriate that these centres be considered as part of the next countywide review of speed

limits, at which point it is hoped that the learnings from the city could inform the process in

the county towns.”

**A.O.B.**

Cllr. Butler wished to raise the issue of the video conference platform for meetings going

forward, stating the Webex Cisco does not work well for members and drains broadband

quite heavily. The executive agreed that MS Teams video conference platform will be used

for future meetings.

The Chair reminded all members that the next Travel and Transportation SPC meeting is

scheduled for Tuesday, the 20th April 2021. He thanked all for attending and thanked the NTA

representatives individually for their presentation and declared the meeting closed.

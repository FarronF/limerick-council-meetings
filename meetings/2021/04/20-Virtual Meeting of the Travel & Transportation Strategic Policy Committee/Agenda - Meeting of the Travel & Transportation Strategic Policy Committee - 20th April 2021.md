**6.Question submitted by Ms. Ailish Drake**

“The impact of Covid-19 is being strongly felt by city residents, performers, traders

and hospitality services. Recent funding announcements by Failte Ireland and The

Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media could have a

significant positive impact on the city and towns across the county in the short and

long term. In order to benefit from these schemes this summer Local Authorities must

prioritise Covid Mobility Plans. Last week Cork announced that they will permanently

pedestrianise 17 streets for outdoor dining.

In order to encourage people to use outdoor space in urban areas, changes to traffic

and movement of vehicles will be required. Pedestrian safety, noise pollution, air

pollution all have a significant negative impact on outdoor spaces.

What plans, if any, are in progress for Limerick City Centre and county town centres

for covid mobilty, walking and cycling and pedestrianisation of streets for outdoor---

dining, performance and urban animation? How are LCCC engaging with business

owners, stakeholders in the arts and culture sector and the public on plans at pre-

draft stage, so that barriers to delivery are identified and resolved prior to plans

being announced? Has a committee of community, arts, cultural, active travel and

business representatives been set up to facilitate open discussion and if so, are

representatives of Limerick PPN included”

**Question submitted by Ms. Ailish Drake**

“The Three Bridges Walking Route has provided residents with much needed outdoor

space  during lockdown. As we move toward summer this beautiful route will become

even more

popular. Improvements to include the addition of the Shannon Bridge

cycle lane last year have been very successful. However, there are still improvements

that can be made, such as widening the route at Howleys Quay which proved a popular

addition last summer.

The Limerick Pedestrian Network carried out a walkability audit of the route last

summer and submitted it to the Director of Physical Development in July 2020. Has

the report been reviewed and if so, are their plans proposed to further enhance the

route?”

**Item 1**

**National Water Resources Plan (NWRP) Draft Framework Consultation 2** **–** **To consider submission**

**from Limerick City and County Council**

Ms. Sonja Reidy, SEO Water Services, gave a presentation on the National Water Resources Plan to

members of both the Economic Development, Enterprise & Planning SPC and the Climate Action,

Biodiversity & Environment(CABE) SPC at meetings on the 8th and 9th February respectively.

Phase 1 of the NWRP includes the Draft Framework Plan which is currently under public

consultation and submissions can be made up to 1st March, 2021 and

Phase 2 of the NWRP requires that a Water Resource Plan be prepared for Limerick City and

County Council to identify plans to provide a security of supply for towns, villages and settlements

in Limerick, with accompanying timeframe and budget. This Plan is essential to enable Limerick

City & County Council to achieve the objectives of the National Planning Framework NPF and the

RSES through its own City & County Development Plan.

Ms. Reidy outlined the recommendations arising from each SPC, which she stated were very similar

to the executive considerations as outlined below:

 No Finance model identified

 Not time specific---
 Not aligned with National Development Plan

 Not aligned with National Planning Framework

 Not aligned with Regional Economic and Spatial Strategy

 Not aligned with City and County Development Plans

 No opportunity to achieve network improvements as part of transport route provision

/upgrades

 Need to achieve security of supply for Limerick

 Need to achieve opportunities for growth in line with national, regional and local plans and

strategies requires water supply capacity.

Many members also highlighted their objection to the extraction of water from the River Shannon

to service water supply issues in Dublin and that the efforts of Irish Water should be concentrated

in relation to repairing leaks in the existing networks in Dublin and Limerick, which was agreed at

(CABE) SPC meeting held on 9th February.

While members expressed concern over the lack of water and sewerage facilities in towns and

villages in Limerick, they asked that Irish Water be requested to prepare a detailed Progamme of

Works for Limerick City and County.

Ms. Reidy stated that the NWRP only relates to water supply, but she could highlight the lack of

sewage treatment facilities in County Limerick in the submission to Irish Water.

Members highlighted a number of Road Schemes which had commenced (N21 Newcastle West

and N21 Abbeyfeale Road Schemes) and requested that Irish Water supply investment programme

should be aligned with these developments.

They also requested that a plan showing the existing grid for water supply in Limerick City and

County be prepared, identifying areas with less than adequate water supply.

As members felt that staff of Limerick City and County Council were most experienced in the area

of water infrastructure, they requested that sufficient resources be made available to the Water

Services Section to enable such projects be undertaken by the Local Authority staff and not

outsourced to Irish Water.

Replying to members, Ms. Reidy stated that substantial works had recently been carried out to the

Croom Water Supply Scheme and a work proposal had been put to Irish Water re other locations,

but due to a limited budget in Irish Water, the majority of water works being carried out in the

Limerick area included repairs to the existing network.

She also confirmed that she would raise the issue regarding the replacement of asbestos pipes in

the submission to Irish Water, even though they had no targeted plan for dealing with it.

On the proposal of Cllr. Galvin, seconded by Cllr. K Sheahan, it was unanimously agreed to call on

the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to provide funding for the necessary

sewerage treatment plants for the County and City of Limerick and also the provision of an

adequate water supply.

It was also agreed that this Notice of Motion be circulated to all TD’s in Limerick---
Ms. Reidy informed members that a submission was being prepared in response to review of the

National Development Plan and one of the major issues raised was the lack of investment in Irish

Water to provide water /sewerage infrastructure in Limerick.

She also informed members of a workshop being organised by Irish Water for Councillors on 22nd

March and encouraged members to attend and express their views.

M. Hayes queried if the invitation can be extended to include both PPN and Sectoral Interest

Representatives also.

In reply to members requesting a meeting with Irish Water, D. McGuigan stated that with

agreement of both Chairpersons of the SPC’s, a meeting can be arranged with Irish Water to

discuss this matter further.

Ms. Reidy informed members that she would finalise the submission and circulate to

administrators of both SPC’s for circulation to members, prior to submission to Irish Water before

the deadline of 1st March, 2021.

Members requested that the submission, once agreed, be circulated to all members of Council and

that Ms. Reidy be requested to give a detailed presentation to the Full Council meeting.

All members of Climate Action, Biodiversity & Environment SPC vacated the meeting at this point.

**Any Other Business**

The Chairman informed members that the Government’s SME Task Force had published its report

entitled the National SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan, which Limerick City & County

Council had made a submission through the Economic Development, Enterprise & Planning SPC.

He expressed concern that there was no follow up with SME’s following the publication of this

report and encouraged both the executive and members to review the Plan and proceed with the

recommendations outlined.

While members welcomed the publication of the Plan, they expressed concern that the

recommendations were geared towards high performance SME’s and did not reflect the severe

pressure that sole traders were experiencing during Level 5, Covid-19 restrictions.

It was agreed that a meeting to discuss the SME Report would take place in the coming weeks.

P. Fitzgerald informed members that the April SPC Meeting will focus on job creation and

maintenance. Representatives from the IDA, Limerick Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise

Ireland will be invited to attend to hear their proposals for supporting businesses in the Mid-West.

That concluded the business of the meeting.

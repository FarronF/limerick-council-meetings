Members thanked M. Cantwell for the comprehensive presentation and welcomed the new

initiatives by Innovate, which will encourage job creation in Limerick city and county.

He assured members that all parts of Limerick city and county were being considered for the

location of E-hubs and that a feasibility study was being carried out at the former Convent in

Cappamore for proposed use as an E-hub.

While welcoming the level of investment by LEO in SME’s in Limerick, members expressed concern

that a lot of small businesses and sole traders, who were a vital part of the community, did not

qualify for such supports and also had difficulty in accessing finance.

M. Cantwell informed members that loans of up to €25,000 were available from Microfinance

Ireland and SME’s were also eligible for various training courses and mentoring provided by LEO.

Supports were also available for SME’s from the Leader Companies, Ballyhoura and West Limerick

Resources, with grants of up to 75% funding.

Supporting members, J. Moran stated that government supports for businesses needed to be

addressed and a clearly defined governance was required to cover all SME’s.

He pointed out that the level of jobs lost during the pandemic could take up to 3 years to be

replaced and he suggested the following:

 An analysis be carried out of SME’s in Limerick prior and post Covid-19, showing the level

of job displacement.

 Supporting apprenticeships for manual trades that will be required under the Housing

Building Programme

 Build on home-grown sectors - similar to the Film / Food sector initiatives

 A case be made for SME’s who export out of Limerick to be considered eligible for LEO

funding.

V. Murray stated that ongoing monitoring of Companies was being carried out by the Rates

Department and an up-to-date report will be prepared in the near future.

Replying to members regarding the setting up of a Local Taskforce to support SME’s, the Chairman

stated that the following item would be discussed at a Special Meeting of the Council on 8th April.

That a local SME Task Force be established as a sub-committee of Innovate Limerick. That the

membership of the committee would include the Mayor; 2 representatives of the Economic

Development, Enterprise and Planning SPC and 2 representatives from the Business community;

and a member of the Education/Training/Skills community. The committee will have a dual
---
reporting relationship with the Board of Innovate Limerick and the Economic Development,

Enterprise and Planning SPC.

The Chairperson confirmed that membership of the Taskforce was open to all members of the SPC.

That concluded the business of the meeting.

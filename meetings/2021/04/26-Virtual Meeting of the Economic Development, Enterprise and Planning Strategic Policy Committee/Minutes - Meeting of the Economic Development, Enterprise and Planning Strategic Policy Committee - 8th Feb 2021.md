***I will move at the next Metropolitan Meeting of the Council that the Council develop a policy for***

***the taking in charge of estates to ensure that all estates are taken in charge within a defined***

***period of 7 years post completion.***

Stephane Duclot, Senior Planner gave a brief presentation on Taking in Charge of housing estates.

He stated that a request for taking in charge can be made by the developer or by the majority of

residents in the housing estate to the Local Authority, but in many cases requests are not received

for a number of years after the estate has been completed. He stated that in Limerick, there is

currently 100 housing estates waiting to be taken in charge and 80 housing estates have been

taken in charge over the last 5 years.

The cost of maintaining estates once taken in charge was centrally funded.

Members expressed concern over the delay in taking in charge of housing estates, the insufficient

value of Bonds and the use of Development Fund monies in completing estates and requested a

review of the Taking in Charge process.

other Regional Plans.

Members thanked Gordon for the comprehensive presentation and complemented the staff on

the excellent work carried out to tackle dereliction in Limerick.

referred to the Housing Department to avail of various schemes.

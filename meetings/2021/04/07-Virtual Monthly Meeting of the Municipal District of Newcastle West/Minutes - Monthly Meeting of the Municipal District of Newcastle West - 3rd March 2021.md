The Executive Engineer, gave a presentation to the Members on the proposed works on the
N21 Coolanoran Road Improvement Scheme. The proposed works are in the vicinity of the
Applegreen Service Station,

He stated that the Coolanoran site was identified as a high collision location by the TIl as a
number of accidents had taken place there including a fatality. He stated that the cluster of
collisions in this area had been attributed to two main factors which included a high number
of turning movements accessing the service station and the lack of visibility of oncoming
traffic.

The Executive Engineer stated that the purpose of the safety scheme was to address the
haphazard parking and to slow down N21 traffic in this area. He outlined to the Members the
key features in the scheme which included the proposal to close the existing north eastern
diverge taper and to install kerbed islands with bollards. The provision of a cycle track also
forms part of the proposed works. He also stated that the 3.5m lane widths, the right turn
lane and the existing ghost island are to remain unchanged.

He noted that pavement overlay works are due to be completed in Q4 2021 in this area and
it is proposed to combine this Safety Scheme with these overlay works in order to reduce
costs, resources and traffic disruption. He stated that a Part 8 public consultation process is
to take place along with further consultation on the project with the service station owner
and the adjoining homeowners during the detailed design phase.

The Members welcomed the proposals and a discussion followed on a number of matters
including the cost of the project and the location of the cycle lanes.

The Members thanked the Executive Engineer for the presentation.

by Councillor Sheahan and seconded by Councillor Galvin that a pilot scheme for Affordable
Housing be considered for these properties. The need for an Affordable Housing Scheme for

8. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

approach road to the bridge.

9. Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

| will ask at the next Meeting for detailed updates on Wards Cross and Devon Road Cross to
include (a) programme of works (b) start date (c) cost of works.

REPLY:

(i) N21 Ward’s Cross

Since the previous update on the scheme, we have had two meetings with the Til Safety
Engineer at which we requested an update on our submitted request for formal TIl approval
to proceed to preparation of tender documents and the allocation of funding. This has been
followed up with emails and phone calls but despite our best efforts we do not have Til
approval or funding to proceed.

Completion of the tender process is dependent on the Tl approval and the completion of
discussions with Irish Water and subsequent design of the necessary water main diversion.

We cannot include the information you requested in items a, b, and c as we do not have TIl
approval to proceed with preparation of tender documents.

(ii) N21 Devon Cross

Similar to Ward’s Cross, we are endeavouring to secure TIl approval of the recommendation
to create a staggered junction and for allocation of the necessary funding to allow Barry
Transportation to proceed with the detail design process and preparation of tender
documents.

As an interim measure, until such time that funding is available to construct the
recommended option, funding has been secured to install signage on the R515, approaching
the N21, to improve the visibility of the N21/R515 junction and the installation of signs will
be undertaken by the area office.

Again, we cannot provide the specific information requested as this scheme has not received
funding to proceed with the detailed design process.

10. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

1 will ask at the next Meeting (a) how much was spent on refurbishing 22 Cluain Arra,
Newcastle West (b) was it part of a bundling works process (c) what standard checks were
in place prior to it being handed over to the family that it was allocated to.

REPLY: In relation to 22 Cluain Arra, the contract was €33,655 (€38,198). An extra
€300 was spent on the rear garden. It was tendered as part of five properties
(Tender 4 Lot 1). Prior to handover to housing allocations, D & D complete an
inspection of the works carried out. If issues are found, a list of these issues
are sent to the contractor who rectifies the items.

11. Question submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan

| will ask at the next Meeting when and if a contract was entered upon for delivery of AHB
units at Woodfield through Cluid and (b) if a valid contract remains in place given the most
recent grant of planning.

REPLY: A contract was entered upon between the developer and Cluid for the turnkey
acquisition of units at Woodfield in August 2020.

It is Limerick City and County Council’s understanding that the contract is
pursuant to the delivery of housing under the granted planning application
reference 17375 and therefore remains valid. The matter is being reviewed at
present in consultation with planning colleagues.

A discussion took place with regard to housing issues in the District and following a request
from the Members, it was proposed by Councillor Scanlan and seconded by Councillor Ruddle
that a meeting be held to discuss these matters with the Housing Directorate. It was further
agreed that representatives from Water Services would also be invited to attend the Meeting.
The Meetings Administrator agreed to arrange the meeting.

12. Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddle

| will ask at the next Meeting that the Council consider speed reduction ramps for the Glebe
estate Monagea. The residents have signed a petition with over two thirds looking for a
ramp to slow cars down coming into this estate. It is particularly dangerous with the number
of small children playing in the estate. Could this be looked at as a priority as itis an accident
waiting to happen.

REPLY: A Speed Survey was carried out in this Estate over a one week period at end
of October 2020.

The recorded speeds do not justify installation of Traffic Calming in accordance
with Limerick City & County Council's Traffic Calming Policy.

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
While there is a very low number of speed violations, the 85%ile recorded
speed is 23km/hr, significantly lower than the 30km/hr speed limit within this
estate.

A further speed survey can be arranged to see if this situation has altered.

carried out. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that the installation of traffic
calming measures needs to be justified and agreed to have another speed survey carried out
at this location,

REPLY: A site assessment will be carried out on this location with regard to the need
for a speed reduction ramp. Following this, any works required will be in
accordance with the Council's Traffic Calming Policy.

14. Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddie
| will ask at the next Meeting that the Council consider replacing the footpath from Heaphy’s

*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  
The allocations are directed at footpath widening, pedestrian crossings and
reducing road widths at crossing points.

Traffic Calming as referenced is funded generally from a different source i.e.
Low Cost Safety.

Nevertheless, a Pedestrian Crossing can be considered provided a suitable
location is identified.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Collins referred to the speed of traffic at Main Street,
Ardagh and requested that traffic calming measures and a pedestrian crossing be carried

out at this location. In replying, the Executive Engineer stated that a site inspection was
carried out and a number of traffic calming measures can be considered.

16. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L Galvin

1 will move at the next Meeting that the road connecting the N21 and Lots Road be taken in
charge by the Council.

The Motion was seconded by Councillor Foley.

Y: In order to declare this a public road, it is necessary to go through a Public
Consultation process in accordance with Section 11 of 1993 Roads Act.

This involves newspaper notification, public display of map of road for a 1
month period and a further 2 weeks for submissions.

The declaration of a Road to be a public road is a Reserved Function.
This process will commence shortly.
17. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Scanlan
1 will move at the next Meeting that that the hand over process for refurbished Council
properties by Design and Delivery be reviewed in the interest of improved efficiency and
customer service levels for new tenants.

taking possession of the building. The Defects Liability Period commences
when the building is certified as being “substantially complete” in accordance
with the building contract and is typically 12 months in duration.

The contractor is responsible for remedying defects that arise during this
period which are his responsibility under the contract. The contractor is not
responsible for normal wear and tear,etc., during this period. Once a tenant is
selected, a demonstration takes place on the operation of equipment etc., e.g.
heating systems. During the Covid-19 period instructions have been left with
each property providing contact details of the contractor should an issue arise.
The majority of issues are addressed over the phone.

Air to water heating systems are now standard in new build local authority
houses as a means of ensuring compliance with Part L of the Building
Regulations and are also being used in refurbishment projects. A greater level
of instruction and engagement is typically required with the tenant on the
operation of this system.

Housing Support Services provide support to tenants post occupancy
addressing any issues that may arise. Limerick City and County Council is open
to exploring any suggestions on improvements that could be made to the
handover process.

In proposing the Motion, Councillor Scanlan highlighted the need for the
handover process for refurbished houses to be improved upon and requested
that the name of a dedicated contact person at local level be made available
to the tenants of newly allocated houses.
The following items were also raised.
The accident history on Dore’s Cross, Templeglantine, on the N21 next to the Devon Hotel.
An update on the provision of safety measures along the R522 between Tiermeana Bridge
and Ardnacrohy Height was requested. In replying, the Senior Executive Engineer stated that

a speed survey was undertaken and the results of the survey have been forwarded to An
Garda Siochana.

It was agreed to hold the April Meeting of the District on Wednesday, 7°" April, 2021, at 10.00
a.m.

This concluded the Meeting.

***down by year), for the purpose of managing the tenancy and -***

***a.**Who is the landlord in these cases for the purpose of tenancy legislation?***

***c.**Are tenants made aware that the Council are the owners of the property?***

***d.**Have any of these houses been sold to AHB’s?***

**REPLY**: The following is a breakdown of the figures requested.

From time to time the Local Authority licensed some of our own Council stock to

Approved Housing Bodies to support vulnerable tenancy integration.

Over the last 4 years the following licences have been put in place;

2017 - 23

2018 - 40

2019 - 31

2020 - 46

a. Approved Housing Bodies manage all aspects of the Tenancy (legislation) and work

closely with the Housing Support Department in relation to all tenancy issues.

b. The period that covers a licensing arrangement is 11 months. Typically the tenancy

support service is funded by Homeless Action Team. Rents all collected by the AHB with a

weekly charge of € 3.80 paid to the Council. The Council provide maintenance services to

the property.

with the AHB and many transfer to full Council Tenancies after 11 months.

d. To date no properties have been transferred to Approved Housing Bodies. The disposal

of Council owned property is by way of Section 183 procedure which must be approved

by full Council.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, how much Limerick City***

***and County Council paid for all of the land acquired in Dromdarrig, Mungret and any adjoining***

***sites, including the year of purchase.***

**REPLY**: The Council paid €2,398,225 million for the lands acquired at Dromdarrig, Mungret. The

year of purchase was 2014.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what projects have been***

***delivered and achieved under the economic pillar of the LRFIP to date and (a) how is the success***

***of these projects measured. (b) how many jobs have been created under these projects to date,***

***broken down by part time, full time, temporary and permanent and if these jobs were filled by***

***persons living within the Regeneration areas, (c)has the Council set specific targets regarding***

***permanent employment for the remainder of the Regeneration Project and if so how will they be***

***achieved.***

**REPLY**: Financial supports are provided to community groups annually to support the Economic

Pillar of the LRFIP. €1m of the annual SIF allocation is ear-marked for projects that

demonstrate an economic dividend for the Regeneration areas. It is important to note

that the majority of applications received focus on projects that meet social objectives.

The applications received are reviewed by an independent assessment panel, who assess

each application based on the merits of the project proposed and its impacts in the

Regeneration areas in terms of employment, training opportunities etc.

As the process is designed to support projects from within the Regeneration areas and or

benefit the Regeneration communities directly a number of Organisations have chosen to

focus on delivery under the Economic pillar across the four Regeneration Areas.

a. The success of projects are measured on a number of levels - firstly the draw down of

approved funding is based on the organisations providing clear evidence of delivery of

the objectives contained in the project proposal. Vouched expenses for review of

related expenditure is also required as back-up evidence to delivery of the project as

outlined in the funding application.

A review of the programme by way of detailed statistical analysis is also carried out.

b. See number of jobs created in Table A and B below.

Table A: Number of jobs created
---
5

Table B: Number of Projects

c. A proportion of the SIF funding for economic objectives is used to support a number of

Social Enterprise Organisations in the Regeneration areas. The Organisations receive SIF

funding to facilitate programmes that bring training and job opportunities across the

Regeneration areas. Based on an analysis of information provided by the Organisations

who are in receipt of SIF funding, the majority of people who engage with the services

provided, e.g. training programmes etc. are from Regeneration areas.

d. During 2020 the Regeneration programme put in place a Jobs Co-Ordinator, through

Innovate Limerick, to work on a number of initiatives that will focus on the following

key themes relating to job creation in particular;

• Sourcing appropriate training programmes for Regeneration residents to ensure

they are ‘work-place’ ready.

• Working on placing individuals on those training schemes.

• Expanding training opportunities for Regeneration residents.

• Liaising with employers to provide placement opportunities for experience but to

move to permanent employment opportunities also.

• Facilitating the implementation of a ‘Social Clause’ to bring with it employment

opportunities in Limerick, as key sites are developed in the coming years.

The work of the Jobs Co-Ordinator is one of collaboration, working proactively with social

and community enterprises, public and private sector employers. Targets, and how the

delivery of same are reported are being reviewed at present. A briefing on this matter will

be provided to all Members in the coming weeks.

**10.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to the Bin Waiver***

***Scheme 2021, can the Council confirm how this scheme was advertised and on what date and***

***also the closing date of the scheme. A lot of elderly people are cocooning and missed the***

***deadline. Can this scheme be reopened in light of this fact.***

**REPLY**: Bin Waiver Application forms for 2021 were posted out in early December to all 2700

persons who received a waiver in 2020.

In addition, the Bin Waiver Scheme 2021 was advertised on all of Limerick City and County

Council’s online platforms and applications forms were made available online and at our

Customer Services Offices.

The original closing date for the Bin Waiver Scheme was 31st January, 2021. In light of Level

5 Covid 19 restrictions, a decision was taken to extend the closing date for applications for

the Bin Waiver Scheme 2021 by a further two weeks to Monday 15th February, 2021. This

allowed a total period of 10 weeks for applicants to apply for the Scheme.

In relation to 2021 Bin Waiver Scheme there has been no decline in the number of

applicants approved for the Scheme. To date Limerick CIty and County Council have

approved approximately 3100 applicants for the 2021 Bin Waiver Scheme, an increase of

400 on the 2020 Bin Waiver Scheme.

In view of the above it is not intended to reopen the scheme.

**11.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, in relation to the thermal***

***upgrade / refurbishment of properties in the Carew Park area, can the Council confirm when***

***properties that have not been completed or properties that have not been started will be***

***contacted for works to begin.***

**REPLY**: Aspects of the Regeneration Thermal Upgrade Programme are currently being delayed

due to the ongoing pandemic restrictions prohibiting access to occupied properties.

Once current health restrictions are lifted to a level appropriate to permit access to

occupied properties, residents within the remaining houses will be contacted, initially to

arrange access for the advance inspections necessary to inform the development of a

property-specific thermal upgrade scope of works.

Thereafter, the works will be scoped and an estimate of ancillary costs will be prepared for

review and approval by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Upon

approval of the ancillary works and costs by the Department, the works will then be

tendered to an established contractor framework panel. A tender report will be prepared

for further Department review following approval of which, the Local Authority will be in a

position to award a contract for the completion of the respective works.

There are number of thermal upgrade contracts (2 / 3 no.) yet to be commenced in the

Carew Park area. These will be progressed on a lagged sequential basis. It is not possible to
---
7

give accurate dates for the commencement of the works on each contract given the

uncertainty surrounding when the scoping process can be resumed. However, from

previous experience, the process, from scope preparation to contract award as described

above, can be expected to take a minimum of 6 months.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if the Council would consider***

***identifying suitable locations for secure bin storage for businesses in the city centre, that***

***currently store bins in laneways, to comply with presentation of waste byelaws**.***

**REPLY**: As part of the Living Georgian Quarter Project, lanes have been identified for potential

upgrade works including housing or storage units for bins. This is still at concept stage and

will be developed in conjunction with the various stakeholders.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***ownerships and future use of the old tourist office building in Arthur’s Quay Park.***

**REPLY**: The Council is in final stage negotiations with Shannon Group Properties on the purchase

of the former Tourist Office. It is hoped that negotiations will be concluded by the end of

March with contracts signed in April.

Once the building is in Council ownership the future use of the building will be reviewed in

consultation with the relevant stakeholders.

**14.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council provide the***

***data collected from the traffic counters on Shannon Bridge (from their installation until now).***

**REPLY**: Automated traffic data has been collected for the Shannon Bridge since 8th November,

2020. Counter data for the period 8th November, 2020 to 14th March, 2021 inclusive is

set out in the appended document.

In addition, Physical Development Directorate is working with our colleagues in Digital

Strategy to feed the output of the traffic counter on Shannon Bridge into the Data

Dashboard which Digital Strategy is developing. The dashboard will be trialled in the coming

weeks and all data on the dashboard will be available to the public.

Counter data for Shannon Bridge for the period 8th November, 2020 to 14th March, 2021 was

circulated as part of the reply.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor S. Novak Uí Chonchúir**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council provide a***

***detailed plan with time frames for removing walls around Moyross to increase permeability and***

***improve social inclusion.***
---
8

**REPLY**: The Regeneration Team are working with the relevant stakeholders with a view to

delivering on projects that will result in increased permeability and foster greater levels of

connectivity among communities on the north side of the City.

A number of housing developments are linked to some of the projects, and will be on site

in 2021.

Other boundaries are being considered as part of wider developments for Moyross and will

form part of discussions with relevant stakeholders as those projects are brought forward

for delivery.

It is recognised that continued engagement with the existing community is critical so that

all parties are clear on the detail of the plan and timelines around delivery. An action plan

based on identified priorities will be agreed with the community, through the monthly

Regeneration meeting structure and in consultation with the wider community as

necessary. Detailed updates will also be provided through various communications

including Housing Workshops as appropriate.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how can Limerick City and***

***County Council dispose of public owed lands to a private developer where land is purchased for***

***housing.***

**REPLY**: The disposal of land is a reserved function of the Elected Members of the Local Authority

under Section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001, so a decision to dispose of any land

owned by the Local Authority is a matter ultimately for the Elected Members.

**17.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick are Limerick City and County***

***Council now buying lands and using 2030 as their agent who then sells it to whatever developer***

***they like without going to market.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council are not buying lands and using Limerick 2030 as our

agents to sell it onward to developers.

Limerick 2030 Dedicated Activities Company (DAC) is a 100% Council owned Company that

was established as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to lead on the re-development of a

number of strategic sites in Limerick. To date, Limerick 2030 has delivered International

Gardens and Troy Studios and are currently working on Project Opera, the Old Cleeves

Factory Site, a housing development in Mungret and are assisting Limerick City and County

Council to develop a number of small developments in Georgian Limerick, via a service level

agreement.

The disposal of property by Limerick City and County Council to an external organisation,

including Limerick 2030, is a reserved function of the Members, as set out in Section 183 of

the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many prosecutions for***

***littering and dumping have there been in relation to the use of CCTV cameras since February 2020***

***up to February 2021.***

**REPLY**: In the 12-month period in question, the Council had four successful prosecutions

under the Waste Management Act 1996 as amended.

There is no provision under the Litter Pollution Act 1997 for the use of CCTV as evidence.

Utilising CCTV footage as evidence under the Waste Management Act is now impacted by

the new Data Protection Regulations and requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment

(DPIA) to be prepared and approved prior to using CCTV. It is not possible, for example, for

the Council to utilise CCTV cameras installed under the Garda Siochána Act 2005 to gather

evidence and initiate prosecutions in waste related cases.

**19.Question submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how much advertising***

***monies have been spent by Limerick City and County Council with Iconic Newspaper in the***

***previous twelve months.***

**REPLY**: The total spend on advertising to Iconic Newspapers between 1st January, 2020 and

31st December, 2020 was €92,180.50.

This spend included festival and event advertising, statutory adverts in relation to Capital

Schemes, Temporary Road Closures Intentions, Decisions and Extensions. Also included was

advertising on Road Improvement Schemes, Planning and Development Part 8’s, Taking in

Charge, Public Consultation Processes, Flood Relief Schemes as well as the day to day

statutory adverts like Commencement of Audit, Hedge Cutting Notice, Register of Electors,

Supplementary Contribution Scheme and Christmas opening hours.

**20.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council outline the***

***appraisal process for the expressions of interest for the provision of mixed-tenure housing on***

***Council lands in relation to the Coonagh site. Who appraised the application? Who was on the***

***assessment panel?***

**REPLY**: The Housing Development Directorate of Limerick City and County Council issued an

Expression of Interest on e-tenders on the 4th November 2020 for the activation of

Council lands at:

1. New Road, Thomondgate, Limerick city

2. Speaker’s Corner, Limerick city

3. Coonagh lands, Limerick city

The Expression of Interest deadline was extended to 4pm on the 18th December 2020.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**22.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, considering the €17***

***million increased funding for cycling and walking infrastructure secured for Limerick, I am calling***

***on Limerick City and County Council to purchase suitable equipment for gritting and treating of***

***cycle lanes / footpaths and to prioritise treatment of footpaths / cycle lanes in the Winter***

***maintenance plan.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Hartigan, seconded by Councillor Novak Uí Chonchúir and

agreed.

**REPLY**: Consideration for inclusion of additional routes and facilities are addressed in advance of

every Winter Maintenance Plan.

With approximately 4,000kms of roadway in County Limerick, it would be unrealistic to

expect that every road and pedestrian area in the county can be treated. Therefore priority

has to be given to National Route system and strategic Regional Routes (Priority 1), which

carries the most intensive volumes of commuter traffic. Note: not all regional roads are

strategic and therefore not all regional roads are included as priority 1 routes. Every effort

is made to ensure that this network is maintained open for traffic at all times. In extreme

weather conditions i.e. a continuous spell of sub-zero temperatures, attention is also given

to regional and local road networks on the basis of needs and the availability of resources

treating up to 20% of the road network at such times.

Where there is a prolonged exceptional cold spell, measures may be taken at District level

to address some additional areas within the resources and budgets available and having

given priority to the approved plan. In such periods salt stocks must be managed to ensure
---
12

strategic routes are prioritised in accordance with the published plan.

**23.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the**Metropolitan***

***District of Limerick calls on the Minister for Education to approve as a matter of urgency the ETB’s***

***Stage 2(a) submission which was submitted in November last year for the extension in one phase***

***to Monaleen N.S. in Castletroy.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Secas, seconded by Councillor Sheehan (C) and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Secas stated that Castletroy was a rapidly growing area and

highlighted the importance of the proposed extension to cater for the demand for school places in

the area. She also asked that the Department of Education engage with stakeholders and the local

community if possible when preparing plans. The Members agreed that this extension needed to

be provided as soon as possible.

**24.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson (to be referred to the Joint Policing**

**Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, that this Council write to***

***the Garda Commissioner, requesting additional Garda resources to police the Northside of***

***Limerick city, as a matter of urgency, in response to the continuous decline of resources in***

***Mayorstone Garda Station and to tackle the increase in anti-social behaviour and crime. Also, to***

***take note of the recommendations set out by the Fitzgerald report 2007 regarding Garda***

***resources in Limerick City.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice to Motion to the Joint Policing Committee.

**25.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council pledges***

***to support workers at Iconic News, by writing to management, requesting that they negotiate***

***with the NUJ and respect collective bargaining and industrial relations procedures.***

Councillor Benson expressed her ongoing support for the workers at Iconic News but withdrew her

Notice of Motion as a Special Meeting of Limerick City and County Council had taken place on this

issue, since her Notice of Motion had been submitted.

**26.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council***

***implement and enforce existing byelaws to prevent the placement of wheelie bins on laneways***

***and advise offending businesses to consider alternative waste management options.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin and seconded by Councillor O’Donovan.

**REPLY**: It is an offence under the byelaws to store refuse on a public road, footway or pathway,

bar during designated times to allow for waste collection.

However, under Section 4 of the bylaws, permission may be given to store bins on the lanes.

In a recent survey of seven City Centre lanes, the following was recorded:

There was on average 17 bins per lane, including an average of 5 large commercial bins. An

average of six businesses and two apartments were storing their bins on each lane. These

long established City Centre businesses have operated in this way for many years*.* The

apartments in question were above business apartments in Georgian buildings.

Food businesses make up the largest single business sector of those storing bins on

laneways. It should be noted that food businesses are precluded on health grounds from

storing their bins internally within their businesses. Most do not have outdoor space within

the curtilage of their premises. To proceed with this proposal would have grave

consequences for these businesses and their ability to reopen once restrictions have lifted.

This would go against Government policy aimed at encouraging the hospitality sector to

reopen successfully and would severely impact job creation and the livelihoods of business

owners and their staff. Limerick is heavily reliant on the food sector to both drive footfall

and attract customers into the City centre. The recovery of Limericks domestic economy,

the reopening of the City centre and the success of the food sector are inextricably linked.

There are 25 lanes in total in the City centre area. This would lead to 150 businesses and 50

apartments being affected.

It should also be noted, that there is currently a plan being developed for revitalise Limericks

City Centre lanes and that as part of this initiative design solutions for the storage of refuse

containers will be considered.

**27.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Leddin**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council divert***

***unused funding from St. Patrick’s Festival and Riverfest into measures to enable outdoor dining***

***in our pedestrian streets in collaboration with traders.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Leddin, seconded by Councillor O’Donovan and agreed.

**REPLY**: As part of the 2021 Budget process the funding for St. Patrick’s Festival and Riverfest was

reduced significantly due to the anticipated impact of Covid 19 and the budget that was

allocated is being used for the delivery of the planned digital content for these events.
---

Limerick City and County Council are currently working with Fáilte Ireland in relation to

the roll out of the Outdoor Dining Scheme, which was recently announced.

**28.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Hartigan (to be referred to the Environment**

**Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council install on**-**street compost bins for people to dispose of compostable cups and***

***green waste.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Environment Strategic Policy Committee.

**29.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor O. O’Sullivan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council adopts the recommendations for local authorities in the 'More Women –***

***Changing the Face of Politics' report by Dr. Fiona Buckley and Dr. Lisa Keenan published this***

***month.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor O’Sullivan, seconded by Councillor Kiely and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor O’Sullivan welcomed the launch of the report ‘More Women –

Changing the Face of Politics’ in conjunction with International Women’s Day. She highlighted the

three recommendations in the report that were relevant to Local Authorities and the importance

of making the role of Councillor more transparent.

**REPLY**: This report states that local authorities need to work to demystify the role of the

Councillor and the three recommendations in this report applicable to local authorities

are:

1. Run campaigns highlighting and explaining the role and impact of local Councillors;

2. Provide post-election training on Council structures and their functions;

3. Provide equality, diversity and inclusion training for staff and elected representatives.

While some aspects of these three recommendations have been carried out by the local

authority, other aspects of the recommendations can be explored in conjunction with the

Women’s Caucus within Limerick City and County Council, with a view to delivering these

measures for all Elected Members, as well as local authority staff.

Members supported the motion but also agreed that speed ramps were not the only solution and

that other traffic calming measures and design, along with enforcement measures, should be

considered when addressing issues of traffic speed in residential settings.

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council’s Traffic Calming Policy was approved by the Council

following a recommendation of the Travel and Transportation SPC in March 2018. The

policy applies specifically to Local Collector Roads and Access Roads that carry

primarily residential, limited commercial and social traffic (schools etc.) and may also

have significant pedestrian and cyclist traffic.

The need for traffic calming measures may be brought to the attention of Council

Officials either directly through a Council District office, the Customer Services

Department etc. or via an Elected Member of the Municipal District. The need for

a review may also be instigated by the local area engineer.

Details of how a scheme is assessed for suitability (by the District Engineers) are outlined in

the Policy as summarised in Appendix A of the policy. Proposals are then reviewed for

approval by the Senior Engineer, Roads and Traffic and may then proceed subject to funding

being available.

Considerations include road geometry, existing traffic speeds measured, support of the local

residents and where other than minor works are proposed the measures should be

advanced with full public consultation provided for under:-

**Section 38– subsection (1) oftheRoad Traffic Act 1994**, (No. 7 of 1994)

These reserved functions were conferred on Municipal District Members under the **Local**

**Government ReformAct 2014** (Part 1 of Schedule 14A Ref. No. 28).

With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, it was agreed to take Item 34 next.

**34. Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Council opposes***

***the closure of the Rehab Logistics Plant, calls on the Rehab group to engage with the Workplace***

***Relations Commission and calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to***

***intervene to prevent the job losses.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C), seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Sheehan (C) expressed concern at the job losses at Rehab and

that the workers would get a fair redundancy package. The Members, in supporting the Motion,

also noted that it would affect some of the most vulnerable and weakest in society, which was

unacceptable.

**31.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we engage with the***

***UL Governing Authority and the Gardai on a proposal to install cameras in the community***

***adjoining the estates near the UL campus.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Sheahan (M) and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Kiely referred to recent media reports of issues involving street

parties and students in the Castletroy area and highlighted the benefits, for students and residents,

of installing CCTV cameras in the housing estates near the University of Limerick.

The Director, Service Operations confirmed that Limerick City and County Council was responsible

for a large number of CCTV cameras across the local authority area, which were quite expensive to

provide and maintain on an ongoing basis. He also confirmed that an audit of the use of CCTV

cameras was being carried out at present by the Data Protection Commissioner and that no further

CCTV Cameras could be installed pending the outcome of this audit.

**32.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Kiely**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that we write to the TII***

***to request the inclusion of the opening of the Carew Park link road in the context of the M20***

***project.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Kiely, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

Members supported the motion and highlighted the potential economic and social benefits for the

Southside of the city with the opening of the link road and that it would provide increased access

to the City Centre as well.

**33.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council writes***

***to the Minister for Education and to keep the current levels of staff in St. Marys School, which has***

***been recognised as, Deis school. The loss of staff would have a detrimental effect on the children’s***

***education and wellbeing and would be against the ethos of providing a proper education to them***

***in their very important early years.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Costelloe, seconded by Councillor Benson and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Costelloe expressed concern at the loss of staff in St. Mary’s

School and highlighted the importance of retaining the current levels of staff in the school.

**Best Wishes**

The Members extended their appreciation to John Sheehan, Senior Executive Engineer for his work

in the roads related functions in the Metropolitan District and welcomed Aidan Finn, Senior

Executive Engineer as his replacement in the Metropolitan District.

This concluded the Meeting.

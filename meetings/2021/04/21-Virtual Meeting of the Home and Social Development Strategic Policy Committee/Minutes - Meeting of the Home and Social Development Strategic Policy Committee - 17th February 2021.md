**Item 1: Confirm minutes from meeting held on December 16th** **2020**

**Proposed:** Cllr. Sarah Kiely

**Seconded:** Cllr. Eddie Ryan
---
**Item 2: Matters arising from the Minutes**

Cllr. Eddie Ryan thanked the Housing team and Allocations team for their help with the seven units

in Galbally which have been occupied by families since last Friday.

**Item 3: 2021 Pipeline Update** **–** **Sarah Newell**

Ms. Sarah Newell shared a document, which gives an overview of the 2021 Pipeline Delivery.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage circulated the 2021 targets to LCCC on

the 16th December 2020.

The Build target is 441, Acquisition target is 10 and the Lease target is 84 homes. Total target for

2021 is 535.

Ms. Newell noted that what she was sharing on the screen was only one component, which was the

Build target. This gave an overview of where we are for potential completions for end of 2021 and

the number of schemes, which are underway. Ms. Newell noted that as of today we are on track to

deliver the 441 units.

Ms. Newell will circulate a breakdown of all the schemes under the streams, all unit delivery, bed

types etc… after SPC meeting.

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. John Costelloe asked were the numbers for Moyross and Cosgrave Park included in the

overall figures that Ms. Newell presented. Cllr. Costelloe noted that 441 does not seem like a

large amount of units to be delivered in 2021 due to demand for housing in Limerick. Ms.

Newell clarified that this is the output for the Build stream for 2021 – Acquisitions and

Leasing which are the other streams, are generating their own numbers and are demand led.

Ms. Newell noted that what we can control now with our own landbanks and involving

Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and Turnkey programme means that we will be at that

final figure for 2021. There will be more schemes coming down the line in 2022 and 2023,

which will include the Moyross schemes.



Ms. Anne Cronin asked is it two units of housing for members of the Travelling community

for the whole year. Ms. Newell clarified that there are two units up in Clonlong which are

under construction at the minute that are due for completion at the end of year. Ms. Cronin

asked is that considered a small number of units. Ms. Newell outlined that there is a

Traveller Accommodation Programme that goes beyond the two units mentioned. Ms.

Newell noted that she can get the delivery pipeline for Ms. Cronin for the Traveller

Accommodation Programme. Mr. Lowth noted that those two houses in Clonlong are

probably one of the first specific Traveller units constructed over the last 10 – 12 years. Mr.

Lowth went on to say that the overall allocation to Travellers in general Housing has been

significantly high.



Cllr. Sarah Kiely noted that there are a number of families who have recently been housed in

her area by Ms. Patricia Phillip’s team and it was very successful. Cllr. Kiely stated that it is

important not to focus solely on the two units in Clonlong as they have to be considered in

the grand scale of allocations. Cllr. Kiely noted with praise, the work of the allocations team.

**Item 4: Mortgage to Rent Update** **–** **Jennifer Ahern**
---
Ms. Jennifer Ahern gave overview on MTR scheme and shared presentation.

The main points of the presentation were:

The MTR scheme was introduced in 2012 and reviewed in 2017. The scheme enables AHB’s or a

private company (Home for Life) to purchase the property were homeowner’s are at risk of

losing their home due to mortgage arrears.

There are 1,240 active MTR cases across the country. The homeowner can approach their lender

to ask to be considered for the MTR scheme. If the lender agrees with the homeowner, they can

then apply for the scheme to LCCC, which includes a letter to say that their mortgage is not

sustainable.

The homeowner then applies through LCCC before the application is submitted to the Housing

Agency. The homeowner voluntarily surrenders ownership of their home to the mortgage lender

and will continue to live there as tenant to the Local Authority or the AHB. They pay an

affordable rent, which is based on their income.

Ms. Ahern went through some FAQs on MTR and went on to outline the role that the Housing

Development Department plays with the MTR scheme.

Ms. Ahern gives overview of applications to LCCC have received from 2018 - 2020. In 2018, LCCC

received 34 MTR applications and 30 were approved. In 2019, there were 16 applications and

they were all approved. In 2020, there were 6 applications and these were also, all approved.

Ms. Ahern noted that to date, in 2021 we have received no applications.

In 2018, there were 5 cases completed – these units were purchased by AHBs. In 2019, there

were 9 cases completed, all 9 were purchased by AHBs. In 2020, there were 17 cases completed

(due to Home for Life coming on stream). In 2021, there are 33 applications to progress.

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Sean Hartigan asked what happens to the difference between the house value and

what is owed on the property. Ms. Ahern noted that it is written off, as the mortgage is

no longer sustainable. Mr. Lowth clarified that the homeowner has the option to sell the

house privately themselves, they have no obligation to engage with Home for Life. The

solution is to allow the homeowner to remain in the property and that is the key part of

the scheme. Cllr. Hartigan also asked have we any figures on how many people have

applied to mortgage lenders for this scheme and who have been refused. Ms. Ahern

clarified that we would not be privy to this information but MABS may be able to

provide. Ms. Ahern said she will contact MABS to get this information for Cllr. Hartigan.



Cllr. Sharon Benson noted that once the house is sold, if there is a surplus of more than

€15,000.00 you don’t qualify for the scheme. Cllr. Benson went on to say that she has a

constituent that is not much over the €15,000.00 and cannot qualify for the scheme but

there is a large amount of works to be done in the house to bring it up to standard and

Cllr. Benson asked, is LCCC carrying out those surveys if there are works to be done to

the house. Ms. Ahern noted that the surveys are carried out by an independent person

appointed by either Home for Life or the AHB and they would send it to LCCC for review.

Ms. Ahern asked Cllr. Benson to contact her about the constituent.
---


Cllr. Tom Ruddle asked are the figures nationwide or just for Limerick. Ms. Ahern

clarified that they are just for Limerick. Cllr. Ruddle asked is there an income threshold.

Ms. Ahern stated that the homeowner would have to qualify for social housing as part of

the MTR scheme. Cllr. Ruddle asked, how long would the process take. Ms. Ahern

clarified that once a homeowner has the letter from the bank, many of the cases can be

closed in 12 months. Cllr. Ruddle asked do Home for Life get the property at a reduced

cost. Ms. Ahern noted it is market value.



Cllr. Joe Leddin asked was this the same scheme that has been around for a couple of

years as he had experience with a few constituents who have fallen into mortgage

arrears, have applied for the MTR scheme and in one case, the bank would not give the

letter to the homeowners. He noted that it went on for around three years with the

arrears building up. Ms. Ahern noted that if the bank are not satisfied and will not give

the letter the homeowner cannot qualify for scheme. Cllr. Leddin sought clarity around

another issue and that is if a person has not lost their job but is in arrears through other

personal issues and they are earning above a certain amount, can they qualify. Ms.

Ahern noted that they couldn’t. Cllr. Leddin sought clarity on the 2021 figures. Ms.

Ahern clarified that the first table was for applications that Housing Support Services

would have received from 2018 – 2021 and the bottom table was for active MTR cases

that have been progressing. Cllr. Leddin also asked who makes the final call on whether

it is an AHB or Home for Life. Ms. Ahern noted that it is up to the homeowner to choose

and the bank do not have a say in this. Ms. Ahern went on to say that the majority of

homeowners over the last year are going with Home for Life.



Cllr. Ryan asked about the succession rights for family remaining on in a MTR situation.

Ms. Ahern has just sought clarification around this from the Housing Agency and will

revert to Cllr. Ryan.



Ms. Cronin thanked Ms. Ahern for presenting on the figures. Ms. Cronin asked is it worth

putting down the stumbling blocks around MTR due to the number of homeowners in

mortgage arrears. Ms. Ahern advised that she recently attended an online MTR forum

where the issues were raised but will raise them again with the HA. Ms. Ahern feels that

the issue is with the banks not getting the letter from their bank. Ms. Ahern also asked

members that if they have any other issues with MTR to send on to her.



Mr. Mike McNamara asked is the house sold at the market value. Ms. Ahern confirmed

this. Mr. McNamara asked what would happen if the homeowner had put significant

money into the property before the mortgage became unsustainable and if the house

was sold back, would this be taken into consideration? Ms. Ahern clarified that this

would be considered as part of an assessment if the homeowner was to buy back the

property. Mr. McNamara asked would there be an agreement drawn up beforehand to

make sure the provision is there after the five years – Ms. Ahern confirmed this is the

case.



Ms. Ahern will circulate presentation after the SPC.

**Item 5: Regen Structure Update** **–Elaine O’Connor**

Ms. Elaine O’Connor (Regeneration Programme Manager/acting SEO) gave a brief update on the

new staffing structure for Regeneration and shared a presentation of structure for both Northside

and Southside.

Some of the main points of the presentation were:

A new introduction in the team is having technical staff as part of the Regeneration team.
---
Ms. O’Connor noted that for the Social Intervention Fund 2021, there were over 200 applications

submitted and deadline was extended due to request from December SPC.

The team are now half technical and half administration. Ms. O’Connor noted the presence of new

staff and stressed the importance of the new staff being a presence among the communities in

Regen.

There are weekly staff briefings with regard to the context of the LRFIP and where Regen is going

over the next three years.

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Leddin asked is it possible to get an update for the physical side of Regen – particularly

for the Ballinacurra Weston side as there was a road previously planned and also looking at

what is happening to the plan for the Olympic/Galvone Arms bar demolishment and road

planned for area. Ms. O’Connor advised that Mr. Declan White is dealing with the road

connection projects and they both still on the plan. The price for demolishing pub has been

received recently and it’s with the Dept. for approval however, it has gone over estimated

cost. Ms. O’Connor noted it should be actioned very shortly in terms of demolishing. Ms.

O’Connor went on to say that in terms of the road at Byrne Avenue, she does not have a

timeframe currently. Cllr. Leddin asked for an indicative timeframe for this project.

**Item 6: Scheme of Priorities** **–** **Private Downsizing (Rightsizing) Scheme** **–** **Sarah Newell**

Ms. Newell noted that this is an update since September workshop – keen to bring this policy in as

soon as possible.

The financial contribution and age band was endorsed by SPC members on the 22nd September. It

was agreed as part of the financial contribution for the scheme as one flat band contribution for the

age (55 – 80+) and that the contribution would be agreed at a quarter of the net proceeds of the sale

of the private dwelling to become a tenant.

Ms. Newell noted that the next step is to legally embed this financial contribution scheme into the

current LCCC allocation scheme to enable us to operate legally with the scheme and to do an

Expression of Interest. There is a legal basis for this – section 22.9 of the Housing Act 2009 which

allows for the review of the allocation scheme by the elected members of the LA for its amendment

or for a new scheme.

Ms. Newell advised that what we are proposing is to insert a new paragraph into the allocations

scheme that was adopted in 2017 to describe the financial contribution element which is a quarter

of the net proceeds of the sale and the applicable age band which will be primarily for over 55’s.

Ms. Newell noted that the cover note will be circulated after SPC.

Ms. Newell advised the next step is for this to be brought to full council for the elected members to

adopt, consider and review the new allocation scheme. Ms. Newell advised that we need an

endorsement at this stage on the text for the private downsizing (rightsizing) scheme element.

Ms. Newell showed members paragraph of text that is being proposed to be brought in to the

allocation scheme. Ms. Newell gave brief overview of background of 2017 adopted allocation

scheme and noted that we are proposing a draft revision. Ms. Newell went on to say that we are
---
doing is we are proposing to input the scheme to allow us to operate the private downsizing

(rightsizing) scheme.

Ms. Newell read out the parameters to members and she noted that we have limits in terms of our

funding from the Dept. in that we are subject to caps. Ms. Newell advised that it an indication of the

text are is being proposed to go to the next full Council meeting in March.

*Ms. Newell is seeking endorsement from SPC members to proceed with the indicated text to Full*

*Council for adoption for the Private Downsizing (rightsizing) Scheme.*

**Proposed:** Cllr. Catherine Slattery

**Seconded:** Cllr. Eddie Ryan

*The Home and Social Development SPC noted the contents of the attached revision to the*

*Limerick City and County Council Allocation Scheme to embed the financial contribution*

*element of the Private Downsizing (Rightsizing) Scheme and endorsed the contents therein.*

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Slattery asked Ms. Newell for clarification around the financial contribution particularly

if, for example, a person had a four bedroomed house. Ms. Newell advised that it is a

quarter of the market value of the house, for example if it is valued at €200,000 then you are

paying €50,000 to become a council tenant. Ms. Newell went on to explain that the

€150,000 is given to the now tenant for the sale of their house and LCCC takes the €50,000.

Ms. Newell reiterated the point that it was agreed that the workshop that this would be a

one year pilot and if it’s felt that the contribution or age band needs reviewing this can be

done after the year. Cllr. Slattery sought clarification on the price limit of the property,

which is stated in the text. Ms. Newell clarified that LCCC has different bands for different

bedroom types and a difference between Limerick City and Limerick County. Typically, for an

acquisition is it a €303,000 cap for a four bed and then the caps go down for 3 or a 2 bed.

The Dept. are updating these caps.

**Item 7: Orchard Site** **–** **Housing Development Directorate Update**

Ms. Duke gave brief update but will come back with formal presentation as progress is made on the

project.

Ms. Duke noted that the Orchard Site is a 27-unit development; it has 18 two-bed units and 8 one

bed units.

A Part 8 application was voted through in October 2019. The detailed design process for the project

is completed and a pre-tender estimate has been prepared to support a Stage III application to the

Dept.

Ms. Duke advised the next step is after the Stage III approval comes back that we go to tender with

the project. It’s classed as an elderly project (55+) in a managed type complex. Ms. Duke noted that

by our April SPC we should have progressed through the Stage III approval with the Dept. and will

come back with an update.

**St.** **Anne’s Court Update**:
---
Ms. Newell noted that we have funding for five sites in the City under the Serviced Sites Fund – one

of those sites is Sonny’s Corner. We have received approval from the Dept. to progess that site for

affordable housing which will include St. Anne’s Court which is currently under LCCC ownership. Ms.

Newell noted that we are looking to progress an affordable housing scheme on the landbank.

Ms. Newell gave background on the Service Sites Fund to members – it is a grant of €1,000.000 from

the Dept. to pay for the infrastructure on the condition that we deliver Affordable Housing. St.

Anne’s Court is progressing under Seamus Hanrahan’s team in Design & Delivery. Ms. Newell also

noted that we can come back with an update to the next SPC on the Service Sites Fund.

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. John Costelloe asked are we handing over LCCC land to a private developer. Ms. Newell

clarified that we are progressing the site to design the site for affordable housing and then

we look at the delivery of the site – through LCCC or an AHB.

**Item 8: Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor L. Galvin (to be referred to the Home and Social**

**Development Strategic Policy Committee)**

**I will move at the next Meeting that this Council call on the Minister for Housing to include derelict**

**houses in the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme.**

Cllr. Liam Galvin gave background on scheme – it is a scheme used for people who do not qualify for

mortgages from financial institutions but it does not allow for derelict properties.

Cllr. Galvin feels there is an opportunity here to purchase derelict properties at a reasonable price

and feels this would benefit the LA as well. He notes it would give people a good start to getting on

the property ladder and may help to take them off the HWL.

*Cllr. Galvin sought* *support to write to Minister Darragh O’Brien* *to seek clarification on the current*

*legislation under the scheme and to amend the legislation to allow for derelict properties to be*

*included in the RIHL scheme. Also, to ask, what delegated authority and discretion can LCCC staff*

*exercise in relation to this scheme.*

**Proposed:** Cllr. Liam Galvin

**Seconded:** Cllr. Eddie Ryan

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Ryan believes that if this was implemented, it would be a boost to small villages and

towns as couples would want to stay. He also notes that what Cllr. Galvin has proposed is

important and supports the motion.



Cllr. Ryan, Cllr. Teefy, Cllr. Foley, Cllr. Kilcoyne, Cllr Donegan, and Cllr. Keary support

the motion.



Cllr. Keary also supports the motion and noted that over the last couple of months when a

constituent has come to him regarding the RIHL, he has advised to stay away from it. He

notes that there a number of constituents who have failed to procure a mortgage under the

scheme despite being eligible. Cllr. Keary voiced his frustration with the LCCC staff running

the scheme but it is a fantastic scheme if administered correctly. Ms. Duke is aware of the

case that Cllr. Keary was referring to and notec that the set of rules around the loan system
---
are very black and white. Ms. Duke advised that we help people as much as possible but we

have to adhere to the rules of the RIHL.



Mr. Lowth noted that the motion is fully supported as LCCC officials and that he agreed that

the Derelict buildings should fall under this scheme.



Cllr. Galvin noted that he did not have the same experience that Cllr. Keary had with LCCC

staff and is aware of the restrictive parameters that the staff work with. Cllr. Galvin asked for

Ms. Duke and Mr. Lowth to send a letter to Minister Darragh O’Brien with valid reasons

behind why Derelict buildings should be included in scheme. Cllr. Galvin noted that if derelict

buildings are included, that it should still only include First Time Buyers and not be opened

up further.



Mr. McNamara asked Cllr. Keary to withdraw his remarks regarding LCCC staff as he noted

that staff are working within the legal parameters of the scheme.



Cllr. Donegan supported motion and asked Cllr. Keary to withdraw remarks about LCCC staff

also. Cllr. Leddin agrees with Cllr. Donegan in relation to Cllr. Keary withdrawing remarks.



Cllr. Keary acknowledged the scheme is well devised and on a number of occasions he

sought clarification from the Dept. on the administration of scheme and noted the problems

around self builds and their size. Cllr. Keary was made aware from the Dept. that these

issues were at the discretion of the LA but he experienced no discretion or help. Cllr. Keary

noted he was not withdrawing remarks but stated that it is not the case with the majority of

LCCC staff.



Mr. McNamara noted that the staff who Cllr. Keary were dealing with may have not had the

right to make a decision or exercise authority and felt his comments were targeted to all

LCCC staff.



Mr. McNamara also asked to include when writing to Minister O’Brien to ask what delegated

authority and discretion can LCCC staff exercise in relation to this scheme.

**Item 9: General Updates**

a. Area of Choice – Rob Lowth

Mr. Lowth noted that they are in the process of updating the Housing Application and the SSHA

information. There is a mismatch currently between the choices on the SSHA and on the Housing

Application and are currently trying to implement the new adopted areas (specifically for the

Metropolitan Area, which is the largest effected area).

Mr. Lowth said that he is hoping to have that implemented within the next four weeks providing the

Housing Agency gives their approval. No date yet for 2021 SSHA – completion date approximately

around the Summer.

Mr. Lowth advised that a presentation could be given on the comprehensive breakdown of the

different areas for members at the next SPC.

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Benson asked for clarification about the newly adopted areas of choice. Mr. Lowth

noted it is more aligned to the electoral areas. Ms. Newell clarified that at an earlier SPC a

couple of years ago the members were involved in a workshop to define new areas of choice

in the Metro area and the county areas. The idea is to make the areas broader and to give

more choice to applicants. Cllr. Benson queried the roll out of the choice based letting. Ms.

Newell clarified this is ongoing and there is a pilot in NCW. Ms. Newell noted that we have

had recent discussions with Mr. Lowth and Ms. Phillips regarding the areas in the City. Ms.

Newell also noted that we could give an update on that at the next SPC.
---
b. Minister Darragh O’Brien Reply to HAP Letter – Rob Lowth

Mr. Lowth noted that the letter reiterates the discussions up to that point and the situation remains

in terms of the design of the HAP scheme. Mr. Lowth advised there are time constraints around

vetting applicants at that point. There is a lead in time with LA social housing but with HAP it is

market led between the landlord and the tenant. Mr. Lowth clarified the risk is such that if there is a

delay the potential if there for that person to lose the property.

Mr. Lowth advised that if any members have concerns about HAP tenants to let Housing Support

Services know as they have the power to remove the HAP payment if there is proven anti-social

behavior. Mr. Lowth noted that they are looking at a number of cases around the county now in

relation to that and working with the Gardaí.

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Keary noted that the letter is quite clear for HAP and is similar to that of LA social

housing. Cllr. Keary felt that if HAP tenants could be vetted, it would lead to a better

outcome of tenancies. Cllr. Keary asked Ms. Duke is she satisfied that we are following the

letter when it comes to a HAP tenant being allocated a property.



Cllr. Ryan noted that Cllr. Keary had a fair point and that there is potential to be subsidising

criminality if the checks are not done but Cllr, Ryan appreciates the volume of work HSS is

doing.



Ms. Duke reiterated the point Mr. Lowth made in relation to the work being done across the

county with the Gardaí. Ms. Duke noted that our powers of removing HAP payments for

proven anti-social behaviour is a good course of action and she is more than happy to listen

any issues on HAP tenants from members.



Cllr. Benson was concerned when this came up initially about people losing out on HAP

tenancies while the Garda vetting was being done but Cllr. Benson is delighted that Mr.

Lowth is working with the Gardaí on the test cases.

**Item 10: AOB**

**Notice of Motion from Cllr. Eddie Ryan**

**I will move at the next meeting of the Home and Social Development Strategic Policy Committee**

**that each member of the public be limited to one rep per elected representative in relation to**

**requests for housing support services and housing maintenance.**

Cllr. Ryan noted the reason he is bringing this to the SPC is that there are approx. 35,000 reps that

come in to Customer Services annually.

Cllr. Ryan was involved recently at the Cappamore-Killmallock MD meeting in relation to housing

reps and housing maintenance and it was found that 86% of reps are from elected members from

Dáil Eireann and only 14% are from Councillors. Cllr. Ryan believes that if we look at Planning, where

it is one rep per person and thus eliminates the multiple reps, that he would like to see this

implemented in housing maintenance and housing support services. Cllr. Ryan noted the volume of

e-mails that had been sent out to members of Cappamore-Killmallock MD and TD’s in relation to a

property in Galbally that was allocated and since then, was not taken up.
---
*Cllr. Ryan sought support to limit reps to one rep for one person per elected representative.*

**Proposed:** Cllr. Eddie Ryan

**Seconded:** Cllr. Conor Sheehan

A discussion took place around this and the main points were:



Cllr. Sheehan noted that there is a significant amount of housing reps received by public

representatives and there is a lot of doubling up which creates a lot of work for everyone

involved. Cllr. Sheehan suggested that a person picks a representative who they stick with

and if they want to move to another representative that they inform LCCC. Cllr. Sheehan

noted that is extremely hard for Councillors to get a system for making reps other than going

to through Customer Services so Cllr. Sheehan would welcome anything that would reduce

the amount of doubling up. Cllr. Sheehan also thanked Ms. Duke and team for stopping the

issues with housing clinics. Cllr. Sheehan commended Cllr. Ryan for bringing it forward.



Cllr. Kiely noted that she understands Cllr. Ryan’s sentiment but believes the percentage of

reps from TD’s is staggering and she feels it is cause for concern when it comes to housing

reps. Cllr. Kiely believes Councillors should be given priority when it comes to local issues like

housing reps. Cllr. Kiely noted that this has validated her concern regarding TD’s putting in a

large volume of housing reps and that the figures are skewed.



Cllr. Ryan noted he agrees with Cllr. Kiely’s point but that we need to focus on the numbers

of reps that come in and the low percentage of reps that have come in from Councillors. Cllr.

Ryan notedthat we need to think of staff workload.



Cllr. Kiely queried the logistics of this motion and how it will work within the election cycle

and she notes that she does not see it as workable but agrees with sentiment.



Mr. Lowth noted that this motion would make it easy for LCCC officials and supports the

motion on the basis that the one person who will benefit is the person making the reps as

their expectation is contained at the source. Mr. Lowth noted that he takes Cllr. Kiely’s point

at the change between the Oireachtas and the LA but there is always a solution and he

suggested a substitute nomination in terms of reps.



Cllr. Benson asked Cllr. Ryan to re-read the motion out to members. Cllr. Ryan also asked for

motion to be circulated to members if it passed. Cllr. Benson asked for clarification around

the motion and Cllr. Ryan elaborated on the context. Cllr. Ryan feels one rep is enough and

feels that the constituent would get a better service.



Cllr. Keary supports Cllr. Ryan’s motion and noted that the rep system is working well in

Planning. Cllr. Keary went on to say that it focuses the elected member’s attention on the

one rep. Cllr. Keary notes that he feels that one rep will make it fair on LCCC staff.



Cllr. Sheehan noted that he supports Cllr. Kiely’s points and he went on to say that elected

members cannot get housing clinics due to volume of queries coming in and then you have a

situation whereby constituents are hopping from one TD to another with the same reps. Cllr.

Sheehan feels the doubling up is impacting Councillors time and LCCC staff’s time and it

needs to be streamlined.



Cllr. Benson noted that she agrees with the sentiment of Cllr. Ryan’s motion but noted that

she believes the notification e-mails should still go out to inform all. Cllr. Benson said that

the one-person rep is fine but in relation to housing appointments, Cllr. Benson wanted to

note that not all Councillor’s having housing appointments and if it is the situation then we

need a level playing field.



Cllr. Kiely agreed with Cllr. Benson and Cllr. Sheehan, we need a level playing field. Cllr. Kiely

noted that she would like to make an amendment to the motion if Cllr. Ryan would allow it,

that Councillors get priority over TD’s. Cllr. Ryan agrees with Cllr. Kiely’s point but noted that

he is not sure how that would work, and he went on to note that TDs are as entitled to make

a rep for someone as Councillors are but only rep. Cllr. Kiely advised that anyone with a

Limerick.ie address could be identified as Councillor and anyone with an Oireachtas.ie e-mail

is identifiable as a TD and that way the Councillor reps could be weighted over a TD. Cllr.

Ryan agreed with Cllr. Kiely’s sentiment.



Cllr. Donegan supported Cllr. Ryan’s motion but his fear is that they might be boxing

themselves into a corner if the existing survey show that Councillors are only putting in 14%

representations but Cllr. Donegan is supportive of motion and he advised members that

they had a good discussion at the Cappamore-Killmallock MD meeting.



Ms. Duke asked the question are members happy how the current representations are being

implemented in Planning and asked about the logistics of it. Cllr. Ryan noted that if a person

selects a Councillor for their Planning application that they must stick with that Councillor

however, this makes more sense as the applicant cannot go from one Councillor to another.

Cllr. Ryan noted that he would like to see how this works for Housing reps.



Mr. Lowth note that he supports the sentiment of the motion but if forty Councillors held

forty Housing clinics this will increase workload. Mr. Lowth advised that we would welcome

an adopted approach across the board and for the Councillors to design the approach. Mr.

Lowth went on to say that the motion is good, and it is to be supported but he advised

members to look at the approach to take on the motion and to come back to officials on the

guidelines.



An Cathaoirleach Cllr. Murphy asked is there a review of the rep system being done

currently through the review of the SugarCRM system. Mr. Lowth notes that there is work

going on in Customer Services, but it is focusing on the responses and how LCCC staff close

the rep. They are trying to come up with the right system for Housing.



Cllr. Kiely responded to Mr. Lowth and advised that one or two other Councillors raised the

issue that TDs get Housing clinics and that does not make the field level. Cllr. Kiely went on

to say that it is becoming a big issue for some Councillors that we cannot get the same work

done as TDs and Councillors are the ones who are running the local authority. Mr. Lowth

agreed with Cllr. Kiely’s point.



Cllr. Keary noted that if we were to replicate the system in the Planning department there

are exceptions there where there can be more than one rep and he asked Ms. Duke to get a

template on how they work their system and what they allow or do not allow then we could

look at it for the next SPC, but he supports the single rep motion.



Cllr. Ryan noted that he would like to see this go to the Full Council meeting for their opinion

and if full Council support then we can take it forward. An Cathaoirleach Cllr. Murphy noted

that is conscious of having guidelines around it before taking it forward. Cllr. Ryan believes

that what he had heard today there is a consensus of support, but he noted that if there is a

better of doing it than what he has proposed today then Cllr. Ryan would be for it but he

would like it brought to full Council first and see their reaction.



Cllr. Donegan asked for motion to be circulated.

a. PJ O’Grady asked is the Energy Efficiency programme going to be extended into the current

year. Ms. Duke noted that we had completed the 120 houses in 2020 and the intention is to

do the same type of programme this year and will come back with numbers to the next SPC.

Ms. Duke also noted that the engineer who was working on the project last year is working

on the project for this year. Mr. Cathal Quaid that the Circular relating to this is yet to be

circulated from the Dept. and they are waiting for that first and they are finishing snagging

for the 2020 scheme.

b. Cllr. Costelloe welcomed the new teams in Regeneration and paid tribute to the former

officials in the Council who worked in St. Mary’s Park. Cllr. Costelloe thanked Mr. Declan

White and Ms. Elaine O’Connor for taking the time to go on a walk around St. Mary’s Park

the previous week. Cllr. Costelloe noted the massive challenges in St. Mary’s Park and he will
---
talk to LCCC officials on that. Cllr. Costelloe stated that we need to work on the problems in

St. Mary’s Park.

c. Ms. Una Byrnes asked for the number of units that were brought back into occupancy under

the Repair and Lease scheme. Ms. Byrnes noted that recently at a joint-Oireachtas

committee a Senator from Waterford said that 44% of all one and two-bed properties in the

city have come from Repair and Lease and Ms. Byrnes looked for our Repair & Lease figures

for comparison. Ms. Duke noted that we would be more than happy to come back with a

Repair & Lease presentation for the next SPC.

d. Ms. Cronin noted that at the last SPC Ms. Duke spoke about the five sites under the Service

Sites Fund and the 740 units of affordable housing. Ms. Cronin asked is there any chance to

that number since the announcement of the new plan for the Coonagh Site. Ms. Duke

advised that the five sites under the Service Sites Fund are separate to the three sites that

were announced last week. Ms. Duke advised that we would give an update for an update

on the Service Sites at the June SPC.

e. Cllr. Donegan would like an update on the seven houses allocated in Galbally to see if they

were all allocated and if there was a delay in allocation. Ms. Ahern noted that it was a Repair

& Lease project and at Christmas, Electric Ireland were delayed in connecting the electricity.

Ms. Ahern also noted that due to COVID there were delays with works in the properties. Ms.

Ahern went on to say that on Friday last LCCC carried out the final inspection and the

properties passed with only a few minor issues; the tenants started moving in Friday

evening. Cllr. Ryan noted that two people will be given their keys this evening.

f. Cllr. Keary noted that at the December SPC meeting he asked about the 16 units in

Pallaskenry and he had indicated that he would prefer to see a 50/50 split (for sale and

allocation). Cllr. Keary advised that Ms. Duke indicated that five would be available under

the affordable scheme and he noted the indexation of the site and asked how that would be

dealt with if the purchasers wanted to sell in the future. Cllr. Keary had been advised that

there would be an update at the February SPC. Cllr. Keary would like an update on the

current situation on the affordable sites’ development in Adare. Cllr. Keary noted there are

Council lands in Adare village that are earmarked for social housing and he would like an

update on those. Cllr. Keary requested an update sooner rather than waiting until the next

SPC. Ms. Duke noted that there is no problem giving updates between meetings to members

and there are usually workshops throughout the year to members. Ms. Newell advised that

Helen Creed is the liaison person for the Pallaskenry Incremental Purchase. Ms. Newell

noted that there is discussion around an Expression of Interest to make sure that there is

good communication coverage. Ms. Newell advised that there will be an update over the

next four to six weeks. Ms. Newell advised in terms of the indexation it works the same as a

normal Tenant Purchase Scheme, that there is a claw back mechanism. Ms. Newell noted

that we could give a presentation on the New Build Incremental Scheme either at the next

SPC or the next workshop. Cllr. Keary had asked about the landbank in Pallaskenry that is

being apportioned out for community use but he also noted that some of it is being retained

and he wanted to know if Housing Development have an update on that. Ms. Duke noted

there is not update on that currently other than what has already been discussed regarding

shared use of the site.

END OF MEETING

The Chair thanked everyone for logging in, for their presentations and everyone’s valuable

contributions.

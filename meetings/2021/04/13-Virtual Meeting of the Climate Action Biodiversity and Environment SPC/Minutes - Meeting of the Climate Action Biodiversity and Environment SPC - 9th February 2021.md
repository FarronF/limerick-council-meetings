The NWRP is Irish Water’s plan to identify how they will provide a safe, sustainable, secure

and reliable water supply to their customers now and into the future, whilst safeguarding the

environment. The NWRP will set out how Irish Water will balance the supply and demand for

drinking water over the short, medium and long term. It will be a 25-year strategy. The

development of the NWRP is to take place in two phases. Phase one - the draft Framework

Plan - identifies how IW will assess needs across all water supplies, and the process they will

use to find solutions to address those needs. The NWRP will be based on three principles:

Lose less (water conservation); Use less (education and awareness); and Supply smarter.

Irish Water is now inviting feedback on the NWRP draft Framework Plan and submissions have

to be sent by Monday 1 March 2021.

Ms. Reidy concluded that LCCC will be making a submission to IW, and invited the members

to make contributions as a committee or as individuals.

The members discussed the presentation and expressed their concerns around being grouped

in with Dublin and the pipe line to pump water from Lough Derg to the greater Dublin area.

The lack of timelines around the NWRP, and the lack of alignment with regional and national

Development Plans was of huge concern to the members.

Ms. Reidy agreed that a public utility should take account to government plans and she will

certainly be raising this concern in her submission.

At this point Cllr Collins (M) proposed a motion that this Committee shows its objection to

the abstraction of water from the River Shannon to service water supply issues in Dublin. This

motion was seconded by Cllr Secas, and supported by Ms Hayes.

Ms Reidy advised that inclusion of the motion in the submission could be premature in as

much as the proposed abstraction of water from the Shannon was a separate process which

would have to go through its own assessment processes. Cllr Sheahan (M) made a counter

motion that this item not be included in the submission. This motion was seconded by Cllr

Sheahan (J).

Cllr Sheahan (K) suggested that Cllr Collins (M) motion could be added to include a provision

that “the Council’s opposition would remain until the leaks in the Dublin system were dealt

with.”

A detailed discussion ensued regarding how to progress Cllr Collins’ (M) motion Members

strongly advocated that (i) the submission would argue that Limerick would not be included

in Group 4 region which included Dublin; (ii) that Limerick would argue that no water should

be taken from the Shannon until such time as the leakage issues in Dublin were addressed.

Cllr B Collins advised that the presentation had been made to the Economic Development SPC

on Monday last, and that Ms. Reidy was to revert to the Economic Development SPC on

Monday next. A request was made of the SPC meeting to hold a joint SPC meeting with the

Economic Development SPC on the NWRP Draft Framework Plan.

The Chair, Cllr Scanlan, agreed to discuss the possibility of a joint meeting of the two SPCs

with his counterpart on the Economic Development SPC, Cllr Eddie Ryan, and to bring the

request to the meeting of the Economic Development SPC on Monday next for

consideration. Subject to a positive outcome of that discussion, a joint meeting of the Climate

Action, Biodiversity and Environment SPC and Economic Development SPC could be arranged

to review the submission document prior to its submission to Irish Water.

Ms Reidy agreed to include in her submission, Cllr M Collins' proposal that this Committee

shows its objection to the extraction of water from the River Shannon to service water supply

issues in Dublin and that efforts of IW should be concentrated in relation to repairing leaks in

the existing networks in Dublin and Limerick. And the removal of Limerick from Group 4.

Mr. Kennedy agreed the submission document would be circulated to all the SPC members

prior to its submission to Irish Water. He noted that documents are being finalised as part of

a review of the National Development Plan and a major factor being raised is the lack of

investment in IW to our sewage treatment plants.

In conclusion Ms Reidy proposed to include the following as part of the submission from the

Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment SPC:

• This Committee shows its objection to the extraction of water from the River Shannon

to service water supply issues in Dublin and that the efforts of Irish Water should be

concentrated in relation to repairing leaks in the existing networks in Dublin and

Limerick.

• Regional Water Resource Plans should be aligned with the Regional Spatial and

Economic Strategies.

• Aim to provide a guaranteed supply of water to the towns and villages in the County

of Limerick having regard to the drought conditions experienced in 2018 in East

Limerick.

• Identify funding and timeframe for water supply projects noting impact on Limerick

City & County Development Plan.

The members concurred with this proposal.

**Item 3. Notice of Motion submitted by by Councillor S. Hartigan** (Referred from the

Metropolitan District Meeting held on Monday 21st December, 2020)

I will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council introduce an “Ancient

Tree” scheme to encourage the planting or retention of a single community tree in all new
---

housing developments and suitable existing communities with the Council and community

pledging to care for this individual tree until it reaches the Ancient tree category age of 400

years +.

The proposal was seconded by Cllr O’Brien.

Ms. Gabbett, supported the motion but wanted to focus on retaining trees we already have,

Cllr Hartigan would also like a focus on new planning developments where the planting of

trees can be identified in the planning process.

Cllr Sheahan (K) endorses the motion and added every parish in the county should have 1 acre

to plant native trees and avail of professional advice. Furthermore there should be a bye law

in planning to prevent planting of evergreens within 10 metres of a private dwelling house.

Cllr Hartigan later confirmed the Forestry Manual indicates the planting of trees at least 30 to

60 metres distance from a private dwelling house, but there is no regulation to how close you

build a private dwelling house to the forestry.

Cllr. Secas asked if there was a register of trees, Cllr Hartigan noted this could be part of the

proposed Tree Strategy.

Cllr Collins (B) spoke as chair of Tidy Towns in Adare, and confirmed that work is being carried

out on a survey of trees in the area and suggested that every Tidy Towns committee could do

this survey with the backing of LCCC.

Mr. Kennedy read out the reply to the Notice of Motion:

“We are currently in the process of developing a Tree Management Strategy for Limerick City

and County. It is intended that the Strategy would include guidance on tree planting in

new/existing developments, and consideration on the most suitable trees to plant in a

particular location.

The concept of adopting a tree in a public space does not appear to be as widespread in

Ireland as in other countries, for example the UK. The Tree Council in England, working

through local councils and community organisations operates a tree champions and tree

wardens’ scheme, which engage communities in the planting and preservation of trees in

their localities.

This concept is something we can explore further in the context of the development of our

Tree Management Strategy.”

Mr. Kennedy advised of a pilot scheme ‘Woodland Creation Scheme’ which had gone out to

tender. A pilot Scheme on LCCC owned land, planting of trees in woodland areas of Newcastle

West and Kilmallock and we are looking for other options also.

Cllr Sheahan (K) welcomed this and added he knows of an area in Askeaton that would be

suitable. It was agreed that Ms Anne Goggin would follow up with Cllr Sheahan (K) in this

regard.

Cllr Hartigan welcomed the response.

**Any Other Buisness**

The Chair raised the matter of an e-mail circulated to all SPC members regarding the

forthcoming Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European

Union and Canada. Mr. Hedderman proposed writing to Minister Eamon Ryan and the

Tánaiste Leo Varadker requesting that the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA)

be discussed fully in the Oireachtas.

This motion was seconded by Cllr Sheahan (K), and supported by Ms. Gabbutt.

Mr. Kennedy noted that this will need to go before the March full Council meeting for

approval.

Cllr Collins (B) advised that she had attended a biodiversity webinar on the Queen Bumble

Bee. Queen Bumble Bees come out of their hives at this time of year and their main source

of food is the Dandelion and Willow blossom. On a walk of the Adare river bank recently she

saw Willow being trimmed back. She asked that the trimming back of the Willow Blossom be

delayed until later in the year. Cllr Hartigan supported this.

Mr. Kennedy undertook to liaise with Waterways Ireland/OPW regarding this practice.

The Chair concluded the meeting.

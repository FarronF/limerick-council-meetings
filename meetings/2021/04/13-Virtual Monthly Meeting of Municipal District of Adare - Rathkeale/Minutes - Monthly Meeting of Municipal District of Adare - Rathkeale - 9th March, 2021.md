**QUESTION**
---

**8.**

**Question submitted by Councillor B. Collins**

**I will ask at the next Meeting for an update on the roll out of the National Broadband**

**Plan in the Adare-Rathkeale Electoral Area.**

**Reply:**

Approximately 21,231 premises have been identified in Limerick by the

DECC (Department of Environment, Climate and Communications) as not

being serviced with adequate broadband services, and these comprise the

National Broadband rollout area in Limerick.

The first stage in this rollout by NBI (National Broadband Ireland) is a

surveying of every individual premises covered by the National Broadband

Plan, to ensure a detailed delivery plan for each. This involves analysis for

the fibre route, design of required infrastructure and detailed assessment

of the delivery method to connect each individual premises.

Surveying commenced in the following areas in the Adare/Rathkeale

Municipal District in November and December 2020, and is still ongoing:

 Pallaskenry

 Toreen

 Old Kildimo

 Askeaton

 Adare

 Croagh

 Rathkeale

 Kilfinny

 Croom

 Crecora

 Granagh

 Lees Cross

As an alternative while this surveying and the subsequent network build

phase is completed, the Limerick Broadband Officer in Digital Services has

had 6 BCPs (Broadband Connection Points) approved for delivery in the

Adare/Rathkeale Municipal District, specifically in Loughill, Coolcappa,

Askeaton, Kildimo, Shanagolden and Rathkeale. The DRCD (Department of

Rural and Community Development) and NBI have indicated that they

expect to have the majority if not all 6 of these BCPs connected by the end

of Q2 2021.

In addition, Digital Services are coordinating the delivery of public WiFi

networks in Adare, Askeaton, Croom, Foynes and Rathkeale, under the

WiFi4EU initiative. The delivery of these networks has been delayed by the
---

current Covid Level 5 restrictions, but if public health advice permits we

also hope to have these networks in place before the end of Q2 2021.

Finally, TJ Malone, Chief Executive Officer of NBI Deployment, has been

added to the draft agenda for the Council meeting on 22nd March, where

he will present an update on progress made to date on the rollout of the

National Broadband Plan in Limerick.

**NOTICE OF MOTION**

**9.**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor B. Collins**

**I will move at the next Meeting that (a) Limerick City and County Council uses the**

**powers given to it under the Control of Dogs Act to address the issue of dog fouling on**

**paths and walkways and also the issue of dog attacks on farms and wildlife and (b)**

**that Limerick City and County Council adopts a Green Dog Walker Initiative as part of**

**their response to the above issues.**

The motion was proposed by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Sheahan and

agreed.

In proposing the motion Councillor Collins highlighted that this is a nationwide issue and

would like to see a campaign in conjunction with Limerick City and County Council, Team

Limerick Clean Up and An Post. It was further agreed to bring the motion to Full Council

to get maximum media exposure and also the support of Limerick City and County

Council behind the campaign.

**REPLY:**

Dog fouling is an offence under Section 22 of the Litter Pollution Acts and

dog owners have an obligation to remove their pet’s waste from public

places, footpaths, school/sports ground, the immediate area surrounding

another person’s home etc. Dog faeces is not only unsightly but can also

pose a health risk.

For its part, Limerick City & Council have run a number of “Dog Litter

Campaigns” including local radio advertisements on Live 95FM.  Bins for

the disposal of dog waste have been provided at various locations and dog

waste can be placed in any bin. Pooper-scoopers have been distributed

to dog walkers during a promotional campaign and “No Dog Fouling” signs

have been placed in numerous areas in both the City and County. All

Environmental Inspectors have these signs and they can be installed on

request. Furthermore, stencils have also been placed on footpaths.

Stencils are available to all Area Engineers.

The issuing of fines for dog fouling can be difficult to enforce and the

Council requires details in writing from the complainant with details of the

owner(s) of the pet etc. or the offense has to be witnessed by our Litter

Wardens. The Environmental Inspectors regularly approach walkers of

dogs to ask if they are carrying bags for dog litter. If they are not carrying

bags, our inspectors give them bags and explain the dangers of leaving

dog foul in public areas. This has worked well and people have engaged

positively with our inspectors.

It is planned over the Course of this year to leaflet registered dog owners

in Limerick in relation to owner’s responsibilities relating to dog fouling

and dog control. There are approximately 8500 licenced dogs in Limerick.

Dog ownership has increased in recent years. Consequently, more dog

fouling incidents have been reported and this trend has continued since

the onset of the pandemic in February / March 2020.

Information on Dog Litter including where to purchase bags is available on

Limerick.ie and is regularly shared on Social Media including a video on

Dog Fouling.

A new campaign on Dog Fouling is being created with a number of other

local authorities and this is due to be launched in April/May 2021.

It is also planned that after Level 5 restrictions lift that a number of

planned inspections of popular public places would take place involving

out Environmental Inspectors, Dog Wardens, Park Supervisors and

Community Gardaí to specifically target the issues of Dog Fouling and Dog

Control.

In relation to the issue of dog attacks on farms and wildlife the Council

received only 6 cases of livestock worrying over the last year.

Under the Dog Control act our Dog wardens have the following powers as

set out in Section 16.

Powers of

dog

wardens.

16.—(1) A dog warden may—

(a) where he has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is

committing, or has committed, an offence under this Act or under

any regulation or bye-law made thereunder, request of the

person his name and address and may request that any

information given be verified;
---

(b) seize any dog and detain it in order to ascertain whether an

offence under this Act is being or has been committed and may

enter any premises (other than a dwelling) for the purposes of

such seizure and detention;

(c) enter any premises (other than a dwelling) for the purpose of

preventing or ending—

(i) an attack by a dog on any person, or

(ii) the worrying of livestock;

(d) enter any premises (other than a dwelling)—

(i) which are registered in accordance with regulations made

under section 19 of this Act, or

(ii) where he has reasonable grounds for believing that more than

five dogs which are aged over four months are kept,

and therein examine such dogs as he may find there and the

kennels or part of the premises in which the dogs are kept;

(e) request any person who owns, is in charge of, or is in possession

of a dog to produce, as the case may be, a dog licence or a

general dog licence, within ten days of the date of the request,

for examination by the dog warden.

We would like to reiterate how important it is that the public report

incidents relating to livestock worrying and would encourage all

Councillors and members of the public to report such incidents for

investigation by our Dog Wardens.

**Housing Development Directorate**

The Director, Housing Development gave Members a brief update in relation to the

proposed social housing development in Pallaskenry. The proposal at present is that

Limerick City and County Council will retain road front land for Housing and the

remaining land would be given to the local community to develop a carpark at the front

and an all weather pitch at the back. It was also agreed any proposed social housing

development would be deferred until 2026.

Discussion ensued and Members all agreed they would not agree to any further social

housing development projects for Pallaskenry in the future. The Director, Housing
---

Development informed Members their approval would have to be sought if further

social housing was required in Pallaskenry in the future.

Councillor O’Brien proposed 35.8 hectares of lands be given to the Community to

progress with their plans to develop an all weather playing pitch and associated works.

Councillor Sheahan told the meeting that until such time as suitably qualified people can

certify the lands as being suitable for what it was listed for there was no merit in

discussing the matter any further. The Director, National and Regional Shared Services,

advised Members a professional Architect approved by the Department of the

Environment Heritage and Local Government had indicated houses could be built on the

proposed site.

Following further discussion Councillor Teskey proposed a Special Meeting be convened

with Members of the Pallaskenry Community Development Association to discuss the

matter further before any decision was made on the proposed disposal. This was

seconded by Councillor Collins and it was agreed to convene the Meeting within two

week.

This concluded the Meeting.

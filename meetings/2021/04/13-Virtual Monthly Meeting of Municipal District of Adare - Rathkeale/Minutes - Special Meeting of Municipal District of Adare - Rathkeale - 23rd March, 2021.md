**Housing Development Directorate**

The Cathaoirleach welcomed Gerard O’Sullivan, Committee Member, Chris Kelly,

Chairman and Michael Burke, Liaison Officer of Pallaskenry Community Development

Association.

Gerard O’Sullivan briefed Members and advised that their intention was to acquire all

the land indicated on the location map for a walkway, sports pitch and biodiversity park.

He also advised they were opposed to the Council’s proposal to build 16 social housing

units in Pallaskenry, however, he added the Group was anxious to secure the remaining

lands to fulfil their project. Following discussions with the Director, Housing

Development prior to the Meeting the Pallaskenry Community Development Association

proposed the lands reserved for housing units would be moved to the left of the site so

the proposed pitch could be reconfigured.

The Director, Housing Development then gave a presentation showing Members the

new proposal put forward by the Pallaskenry Community Council. The Community

Developments proposal was agreed in principal, however, final mapping layout to be

agreed in due course.

This concluded the Meeting.

Taskforce on behalf of Mid-West SMEs who were preparing a report ‘The National SME and

Entrepreneurship Plan’ during 2020 and again in 2021 to review the recommendations in

the completed report of the Taskforce.

At our most recent Strategic Policy Committee meeting to consider this matter, the SPC

members have approved *that a local SME Committee be established as a sub-committee of*

*Innovate Limerick and that the membership of the committee should include:*

• *The Mayor of the City and County of Limerick.*

• *Representatives of the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning SPC x 2.*

• *Representatives of the business community x 3.*

*The committee will have a dual reporting relationship with the Board of Innovate Limerick*

*and the Economic Development, Enterprise and Planning Strategic Policy Committee and will*

*be supported by staff members from Innovate and Economic Development.*

On the proposal of Councillor Sheahan (J), seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon, it was agreed

to defer this item to allow for further discussion among the respective political parties.

This concluded the Meeting.

QUESTIONS

The Replies to the following Questions on the Agenda were circulated to all Members

prior to the Meeting and the Questions were therefore considered as having been dealt with:

8.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will ask at the next Meeting for clarification on the phrase “social and economic need” and**

**the following:**

**Will the sample applicants outlined below qualify for rural housing in Limerick under the**

**new proposals in the Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028:**

**(a) Son or daughter of a farmer who is not actively farming.**

**(b) Relative of a landowner (son, daughter, brother, sister) returning from abroad.**

**(c) Son or daughter of a farmer working locally but not farming.**

**(d) Son or daughter of a farmer living in another part of Ireland wishing to move home.**

**(e) Son or daughter who, for care-giving reasons, must live close to their aging parents.**

**(f) A person who grew up in rural Co. Limerick not owning land (born in a cottage acre).**

**(g) A person / couple / family living in a town or village in Co. Limerick who wish to move**

**to the country for whatever reason e.g. medical issues, children with special needs requiring**

**space etc.**

**(h) A person who has or will inherit either land or a site.**

**(i) A person not owning land returning from abroad.**

**(j) A person who will inherit a farm already owning a house.**

**(k) A person who buys a farm already owning a house.**

**(l) A person who has secured employment locally but is not from the area who wishes to**

**buy a site and build a house in the countryside.**

**(m) In the event of the break-up of a marriage / divorce where the home has to be sold and**

**further houses are required to be built.**

**I accept that the proper planning criteria will be applied to all of the above.**

**REPLY:**

It is difficult to respond to the specific scenarios raised above, as each planning

application would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. National Policy

Objective 19 advises that it is reasonable that the determination of

applications for housing in rural areas should be informed by considerations

beyond the siting and design criteria for rural housing. In particular, account

should be taken of whether or not there is a demonstrable functional

requirement for such housing in social, economic or occupational terms and

whether or not such development, of itself or in combination with existing and

permitted development, would lead to detrimental, uncoordinated

development.

The Forward/Strategic Planning Section will organise a Workshop on rural

housing and the proposed Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 within the

next few weeks to discuss these issues in more detail.

9.

Question submitted by Councillor L. Galvin

**I will ask at the next Meeting, in the context of the preparation of the proposed Limerick**

**Development Plan 2022-2028: (a) what defines a farm; (b) what defines a farmer; and (c)**

**what defines ‘actively farming.’**

**REPLY:**

The Planning Authority has not defined a farm, farmer or what defines actively

farming. However, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine

defines a “Farmer” as a natural or legal person, or a group of natural or legal

persons, who exercise agricultural activity as follows: (a) the production,

rearing or growing of agricultural products, including harvesting, milking,

breeding animals and keeping animals for farming purposes; and (b)

maintaining an agricultural area in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation

without preparatory action going beyond usual agricultural methods and

machineries.

10.

The Single Point of Contact (SPOC) system is being used to record, inspect and

track the return of vacant houses owned by Limerick City and County Council.

When houses become vacant, they are immediately inspected and assigned to

one of four categories based on their condition and the level of works required.

**Categories 1 and 2 - these are small-scale works generally**

All such houses are automatically assigned to Operations and Maintenance

and are completed as part of the Teams works programme and budgets across

each Municipal District. In some instances, such houses receive Voids funding.

**Categories 3 and 4** **–** **these require more detailed work and a larger budget**

We are working with the Finance Director and Department of Housing

colleagues to put in place a more sustainable source of funding for such

properties and also working to put in place a team in Design and Delivery to

manage the return of these houses.

A number of the current batch of three and four houses are with Design and

Delivery, with the remainder to transfer in when the full team is in place.

In 2020, we returned over 100 properties from vacancy. A high proportion of

these were managed through Operations and Maintenance.

Going forward, the SPOC tracking process will be maintained to ensure that

properties are inspected and assigned and then form part of a priority work

programme within Operations and Maintenance or Design and Delivery.

Notice of Motion submitted by Councillors J. Leddin, E. Secas, C. Sheehan

**We will move at the next Meeting that Limerick City and County Council, recognising the**

**scale of the Housing crisis, reaffirm its commitment to work with Government and all**

**relevant agencies towards delivering new housing units and, in particular, ensuring that**

**sufficient Social and Affordable housing is built for those in need of same.**

**Recognising, however, its duty to use Limerick City and County Council property in the best**

**interests of society, this Council reject the provisions contained in the Land Development**

**of Local Authorities in approving the transfer or sale of lands to the Land Development**

**Agency.**

**The Council further agrees to write to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and**

severely watered down. Councillor C. Sheehan, in seconding the Motion, said that this

legislation would denigrate the role of the Councillor even further and he called on the Fianna

Fáil/Fine Gael/Green Party Councillors to address this matter with their respective TDs.

The Motion received widespread support from the Members present.

Executive to be united on this matter.

The Motion received widespread support from the Members present.

**QUESTIONS**

**5.Question submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will ask the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the audit of***

***Community and Arts facilities in Limerick City and County and the expected publication date.***

**REPLY:** The final reports on the audit of Community Facilities and Arts and Cultural Facilities are

currently being finalised. The actual audit of facilities in the city and the county is

completed following an extensive data gathering exercise and a survey of organisations

undertaken in co-operation with the three Limerick Local Development Companies. Draft

reports have been prepared for Limerick Urban Area, West Limerick and East Limerick. A

presentation on the high-level findings is being presented to the members of the

Community, Leisure and Culture Strategic Policy Committee on 19th April, 2021. Following

this, a presentation will be provided to each of the Municipal Districts in May / June 2021.

When this process is complete, it is envisaged the final reports will be published.

**6.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick how many road sweepers***

***Limerick City and County Council has, where they are normally kept and will Limerick City and***

***County Council allocate a permanent sweeper to the Limerick City East area.***

**REPLY**: Limerick City and County Council operates a combination of owned and hired, large and

compact road sweepers based at multiple locations. In total, four large and four compact

sweepers operate all year round with an additional two large road sweepers used

seasonally.

From the Street Cleaning Depot on Park Road, three large and three compact sweepers

operate in the Metropolitan area.

From the Roads Depot in Park Road, one large sweeper operates seasonally cleaning

gulley’s.

From the Machinery Depot in Newcastle West, one large road sweeper operates on a full

time rota in the NCW and CA / KM Municipal Districts. A second sweeper is hired in

Autumn to facilitate the removal of leaves.

From the Rathkeale Roads Depot, a compact sweeper operates in the RK / AD Municipal

District on a full time basis.

The street cleaning service in the Metropolitan area is currently under review with a view

to providing a consistent frequency of service across the District on the main routes and

secondary routes. The review will also take into consideration the possibility of providing

a service to housing estates in the District.

**7.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the Noise***

***Action Plan 2018-2023 and if TII have given Limerick City and County Council a response***

***regarding the implementation of noise mitigation measures for the M7, following the Council’s***

***meeting with TII in October last year.***

**REPLY**: A cost benefit assessment was undertaken for the Monaleen hotspot (M7) comparing

the monetised cost in terms of benefit to health by the implementation of mitigation

measures against the cost of implementing them.

A report for that hotspot was submitted to TII and the Council met with their

representatives in October last year. Comments on the report were received at the end of

December 2020, which are currently being examined.

TII also committed to establishing the cost of implementing the mitigation measures,

using an external consultant. The Council has been informed that their cost review is due

shortly, in the coming weeks.

The Council is awaiting TII’s costings in order to finalise the report.

**8.Question submitted by Councillor E. Secas**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick when the Burial Ground***

***Strategy will be presented to the Elected Members for approval and if the Metropolitan District***

***of Limerick City and County Council have made any progress in identifying a suitable site for a***

***new burial ground in Castletroy.***

**REPLY**: The Draft Burial Ground Strategy is on the agenda for consideration at the April Meeting

of the Community, Culture and Leisure SPC. If the draft strategy is recommended by the

SPC, it is anticipated that it will be on the agenda for the Full Meeting of Limerick City and

County Council in May. The Strategy will address the needs for a new burial ground in the

Castletroy area.

**9.Question submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what is the unit cost for***

***reconnection of utilities due to long term vacancy and what was the total cost to Limerick City***

***and County Council for 2020.***

**REPLY**: ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland are the providers of connections/reconnections

of housing related utilities.

The costs of such works are set by both companies with information on the fees related

available on their websites.

The costs are on a case by case depending on a number of factors (in the case of ESB

Networks the length of time of vacancy and certification costs, whereas natural gas

connection costs vary due to the availability of supply, length of connection, trenching

etc.).
---

**11.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***County Council advise what are the plans for the railway line running behind Rathbane and***

***Janesboro. This unused railway line is causing anti-social behaviour and rubbish dumping***
---
7

***which is leading to rat infestation. Can the Council liaise with Irish Rail to get this problem***

***sorted out.***

**REPLY**: The railway line running behind areas of Rathbane and Janesboro is in the ownership

of Iarnrod Eireann, rather than Limerick City and County Council, so Iarnrod Eireann as the

legal owners are responsible for the management of it. Limerick City and County Council

will arrange to write to Iarnrod Eireann to highlight the issues raised by the Elected

Members of the Metropolitan District.

**12.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and***

***County Council advise what plans they have in regard to the land bank between the wet green***

***in Monaleen Park and the Motorway. Can the existing fence be extended the full length of the***

***border and a gate fitted to be opened during the day so people can go walking. Also it would***

***be a great idea to plant trees along the border.***

**REPLY**: The land in question is located at the rear of Monaleen Park and is adjacent to

the Limerick

Southern Ring Road. These lands were

acquired

under

the

Adare

to Annacotty Compulsory Purchase Order, with monies provided by the then, National

Roads Authority, now Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). While these lands

are registered in Limerick City and County Council’s folio, plans for its future use are at the

discretion of TII. The Council is not aware of any plans TII currently have for these

lands.

**13.Question submitted by Councillor C. Slattery**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick can Limerick City and***

***County Council advise if they have received an update from the TII on the mitigation remedies***

***recommended by the Council in regards to noise from the M7.***

**REPLY**: A cost benefit assessment was undertaken for the Monaleen hotspot (M7) comparing

the monetised cost in terms of benefit to health by the implementation of mitigation

measures against the cost of implementing them.

A report for that hotspot was submitted to TII and the Council met with their

representatives in October last year. Comments on the report were received at the end of

December 2020, which are currently being examined.

TII also committed to establishing the cost of implementing the mitigation measures,

using an external consultant. The Council has been informed that their cost review is due

shortly, in the coming weeks.

The Council is awaiting TII’s costings in order to finalise the report.

**14.Question submitted by** **Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick if temporary public toilets***

***could be installed over the Summer months to support people accessing the city.***
---
8

**REPLY**: There are no plans to provide temporary public toilets in the city centre during

the Summer months, as there is no budget provided to facilitate this proposal. There

would also be possible issues in relation to the ongoing supervision, maintenance and

cleaning of temporary toilets, especially having regard to current Covid concerns.

**15.Question submitted by Councillor E. O’Donovan**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for an update on the***

***“Guiding Limerick through Covid**-**19” plans and if the*** ***mobility plans will be reinstated for***

***Summer 2021.***

**REPLY**: The Council gained valuable experience from the implementation of the various plans in

the Metropolitan area in the Summer of 2020. It should be noted that these plans

provided for a mix of responses to circumstances pertaining due to the Covid 19

pandemic at that time. Some of these initiatives provided for the temporary/part-time

closure of certain streets. Business interests represented to the Council of the adverse

consequences of some of these closures.

Under proposals now being rolled out by the Government, the principal emphasis in 2021

will be providing support and stimulus to business to assist in economic recovery and the

re-opening of businesses that have been closed for many months. This is possible due to

the mass vaccination programme now underway that will ramp-up significantly in the

coming months.

The Council recognises the very significant challenges that businesses face and endorses

the Government’s approach.

In this matter, the Council will be guided by a number of initiatives that are being led and

funded by Government Departments and agencies and will seek to maximise funding to

the benefit of businesses. This will be the first priority for the Council.

Any proposals for street closures submitted to the Council will be assessed in the context

of the urgent need to allow the economy re-open and support businesses to re-open

successfully and quickly.

**16.Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick, regarding the Failte***

***outdoor dining capital expenditure funding:***

***How will locations be decided for outdoor dining investment.***

***What criteria will be used to assess proposed locations.***

***Will there be a formal application process to propose locations.***

**REPLY**: The aim of the Weatherproofing and Outdoor Dining Infrastructure Scheme to support

Local Authorities, to upgrade and enhance streets and public spaces and implement

weatherproofing solutions, which will facilitate year-round outdoor dining in key tourism

centres whilst meeting the needs of all citizens. It will be focusing on the city and town

centres that have the biggest tourism impact and subsequently the street or area within

these city and town centres that will facilitate the optimum number of year-round
---

outdoor dining spaces.

Limerick City and County Council will make an application to Fáilte Ireland to avail of

funding for Weatherproofing and Outdoor Dining Infrastructure Scheme. The closing date

for applications is 31st May, 2021. The area considered is Bedford Row and Lower Thomas

Street. This area is best suited to the guidelines laid down by Fáilte Ireland, which are as

follows:

• Be in a permanently pedestrianised or partially pedestrianised street;

• Contain a variety of businesses e.g. restaurants, pubs and cafes offering outdoor dining

with a broad appeal to local and tourists;

• Offer dining opportunities for both lunchtime and evenings;

• Be in close proximity to visitor attractions, museums, galleries, hotels;

• Minimum of four separate individual hospitality businesses should be covered by the

proposed solution.

**18.Question submitted by Councillor J. Collins**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick for a progress update on***

***proposed locations for dog parks.***

**REPLY**: A pilot dog park will be developed in Mungret Park this year to trial this type of initiative

and to identify any potential issues. A review of the pilot will be carried out after 6

***enforcement notices have the Council issued since March 2020 up until March 2021 on the***

***Northside of the city.***

**REPLY**: 8 Enforcement Notices were issued in Limerick City North in the period March 2020 up

**20.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what are the results of the***

***extensive structural examination of the concrete structures on the Weir Bridge, which is***

***situated in O’Dwyers Villas.***

**REPLY**: BHP have completed vertical and horizontal testing of the concrete piers and core results

have been provided to Garland Consulting Engineers. Initial assessment would suggest

that the piers have capacity for select vehicular movements. However, a final conclusion

cannot be made until such time as the foundation of the individual piers are assessed by

Dive and Marine Contractors. Such an assessment has not been undertaken to date due

to the high flow rates and water levels in the Shannon. It is envisaged that such an

inspection will be undertaken in June/July of this year when river conditions are more

favourable for these specialist works.

On receipt of such findings, Garland Consulting Engineers will then finalise their structural

assessment.

**21.Question submitted by Councillor J. Costelloe**

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what are the results***

***following an*** ***engineer’s*** ***examination of the existing wall in Browns Quay, which runs parallel***

***with the River Shannon, and the likelihood of more flooding occurring thus leaving residents***

***vulnerable.***

**REPLY**: The Consulting Engineers who are due to be appointed on Limerick City & Environs Flood

Relief Scheme will be completing Asset Condition Surveys of any existing formal or

informal defences in the City, as an early Programme Item. The existing walls in Brown’s

Quay will be assessed as part of this Survey.

**22.Question submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**
---

***I will ask at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick what the assessment***

***criteria for the disposal of lands in relation to the Whitebox/Cluid Coonagh site proposal that***

***includes the private University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) hospital and if the proposal***

***was considered in the context of proximity to regeneration areas.***

**REPLY**: The assessment criteria for the disposal of lands is publicly available under e-tenders

notice: **RFT 179556 - LCCC Housing Lands - Request for Expressions of Interest.**

It included the following criteria:

1. Project Proposal

600 marks

2. Scheme Feasibility Design

450 marks

3. Delivery and Capacity

450 marks

4. Delivery Methodology

450 marks

5. Financial and Regulatory Standing

150 marks

Furthermore, the expression of interest required applicants to have regard to the

following objective for the site at the western boundary of Moyross as outlined in the

briefing document, which formed part of the expression of interest:

“Requirement to assess this site with the current masterplan for Moyross as part of the

Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan”

In accordance with the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan, the

objectives under the Physical and Economic Framework Plans are to improve the tenure

mix of Moyross (affordable and private housing) and to improve strategic employment

opportunities and inward investment into the area. In January 2014, funding was granted

by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to purchase

the Moyross site on the condition of using the lands for some commercial activities to

generate employment and improving the tenure mix through the provision of private

housing including private affordable housing.

The proposal was considered in the context of the objectives for Moyross under the

Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan.

**NOTICES OF MOTION**

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Slattery (to be referred to the Community,**

**Leisure and Culture Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that basketball facilities***

***be established at parks and outdoor recreational facilities in Limerick City and County.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Community, Leisure and Culture Strategic

Policy Committee.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. Butler**

***I call on the Metropolitan District of Limerick City and County Council to work with Government***

***to clearly define what wildlife conservation protections exist in trees and hedging boundaries***

***between individual properties and between different housing estates, and also that Councillors***

***be briefed on what, if any, existing powers currently apply locally.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Butler, seconded by Councillor O’Sullivan and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Butler highlighted the importance of preserving boundaries

for the protection of hedgerows and natural habitats for wildlife.

**REPLY**: The question of hedge and tree protection involves the Forest Service, the National Parks

and Wildlife Service, as well as Limerick City and County Council.

The emphasis for the NPWS centres mainly on the non- destruction of growing vegetation

during the bird nesting season which is from the start of March to end of August. They

may also get involved when trees play host to species such as bats, if there is a roost

present as it is an offence to disturb a bat roost.   

The Forest Service governs felling licences for trees. This is slightly different in urban areas

where, in some situations trees in urban areas can be felled without the need to apply for

a felling licence. (See attached explanatory leaflet from the Dept. of Agriculture, Food &

the Marine)

The other means of tree and hedgerow conservation is through planning

conditions applied by Limerick City and County Council, which would often seek the

retention or management of trees and hedgerows as part of planning conditions

associated with the grant of a permission.

It is also possible to apply for tree preservation orders as part of S.205 of the Planning Act

and these are included in the Development Plan when complete. This is an involved

process and means notifying the landowner serving a notice on him.

Limerick City and County Council has worked with the NPWS and the Forest Service in the

past in relation to tree issues. Each organisation approaches the issue from its own

perspective and legislative background. The Council is generally governed by the Planning

Acts, the NPWS by the Wildlife Acts and the Forest Service by the revised Forestry Act

2014.

An explanatory document “New Tree Felling Requirements” from the Dept. of Agriculture, Food

& the Marine) was also circulated as part of the reply.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor E. Secas (to be referred to the Climate Action,**

**Biodiversity and Environment Strategic Policy Committee)**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that the Metropolitan***

***District of Limerick City and County Council introduce a digital advertising bins pilot program at***

***parks that will remind people to feed the bin not the grass and will display public information***

***messages and ads. Such a program will help the Council to get some revenue in return for the***

***advertising opportunities.***

It was agreed to refer this Notice of Motion to the Climate Action, Biodiversity and Environment

Strategic Policy Committee.

27.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor S. Benson**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that this Council should***

***examine the Community Wealth Building model with a view to incorporating it into their Local***

***Economic Community Plans (LECP).***

***Community Wealth Building has emerged as a powerful approach to local economic***

***development and has been particularly successful in Preston, England, North Ayrshire, Scotland***

***and Cleveland, United States.***

***The model will allow counties to leverage existing resources, such as procurement, to meet***

***local needs while creating quality employment and promoting equity and sustainability.***

***- The Council initiate dialogue with local public bodies and semi-state companies in the locality***

***regarding their potential role in the strategy.***

***- Local businesses, enterprises and community activists need to be brought into the discussion***

***around developing the project.***

***- The Council could also engage with Councils in Preston, North Ayrshire and elsewhere which***

***have successfully developed this model.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Benson, seconded by Councillor Costelloe and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor Benson highlighted the benefits of the Community Wealth

building model in creating employment, the development of the economy and on the

environment.

**REPLY**: The Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) is presently considering

the process for the development of new Local Economic Community Plans, as current

plans have come to the end of their duration and need to be reviewed. The Community

Wealth Building Model can be considered, and existing models such as the ones referred

to will be examined as part of the preparation process of a new Local Economic

Community Plan for Limerick.

The Council is awaiting Department Guidance on preparation process and timeframe for

review of the existing Plan and the preparation of a new Plan.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor D. McSweeney**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council carry out a site identification study for the provision of a Community Walkway***

***and Playground in Patrickswell Village to ensure Limerick City and County Council are prepared***

***to make a funding application for such works in the future.***

The Motion was proposed by Councillor McSweeney, seconded by Councillor Butler and agreed.

In proposing the motion, Councillor McSweeney highlighted the importance of providing suitable

supports and infrastructure as a number of housing developments were proposed in the area.

The Members agreed the importance, where possible, of providing proper supports and

infrastructure in areas, before new housing developments were constructed.

**REPLY**: The Council supported Patrickswell Community Council to develop a Community Plan for

the period 2020 – 2024 which is completed. The Plan has identified, following

consultation with the local community, the need for a Playground and a Community

Walkway. The Council will work with the Community Council to discuss suitable locations

for both proposals, as local community input is critical. It is also essential that a site

identification study consider the wider strategic plans for Patrickswell.

**Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor C. Sheehan**

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council permits outdoor dining at all commercial premises for Summer 2021. This would***

***entail the use of outdoor awnings, canopies, seating and tables on pathways along all***

***commercial hospitality frontage to assist commercial premises who had to close due to Covid-***

***19 restrictions as they reopen for Summer 2021.***

The motion was proposed by Councillor Sheehan (C) and seconded by Councillor Secas.

Councillor O’Sullivan proposed an amendment to the Motion:

***I will move at the next Meeting of the Metropolitan District of Limerick that Limerick City and***

***County Council permits outdoor dining at all commercial premises for Summer 2021. This would***

***entail the use of outdoor awnings, canopies, seating and tables on pathways along the***

***frontage of all commercial businesses to assist commercial premises who had to close due to***

***Covid-19 restrictions as they reopen for Summer 2021.***

This was agreed by Councillor Sheehan (C).

Members supported the Motion and highlighted the importance of a co-ordinated approach

from the local authority in supporting businesses in re-opening post Covid.

**REPLY**: The Council is actively supporting the re-opening of the economy through a number of

initiatives in support of businesses that have been closed due to Covid.

These include the operation of the Outdoor Seating and Accessories for Tourism and

Hospitality Business Scheme. Businesses, which sell food for consumption on the

premises, can apply to Limerick City and County Council for grant funding of up to €4,000 

(up to 75% of the ex-VAT cost of equipment purchased/ installed)  to buy tables, chairs,

windbreaks, heaters etc. for outdoor serving. 

The Council has a long established process in place for the licensing and regulation of

street furniture. Planning Laws and Regulations govern this. It is also essential to protect

the public realm and mobility of all persons, most especially those with limited or no

personal mobility.

Interested businesses complete a Table and Chairs license application form. The ‘Outdoor

Seating and Accessories for Tourism and Hospitality Business Scheme’ (above) will be

administered in conjunction with the application process for tables and chairs licenses.  

Applicants will need to apply for a Table and Chairs license in the first instance.  Where

a footpath is deemed unsuitable for tables and chairs because it is too narrow,

consideration will be given to a buildout. I.e. an extension or widening of the footpath to

facilitate the location of street furniture adjacent to the premises. In this way, the

business can install awnings, etc. The Council will require businesses to keep the

pathway clean where the street furniture is placed. Furniture must be removable.

Limerick City and County Council will support approximately 10 buildouts for the Limerick

Metropolitan District in 2021.

In recognition of the ongoing economic situation, Limerick City and County Council

will waive fees for Tables and Chairs licenses. However, the requirement to submit an

application for a license remains.

Councillor Sheahan queried if Limerick City and County Council had recently planted

flowers in Adare Village. Councillor Collins informed Members the recent planting in the

village had been carried out by the Adare Tidy Towns group. Councillor Sheahan

proposed a provision be included in the 2020 estimates to provide for planting of

flowers in all towns in the District. This was seconded by Councillor Teskey and agreed.

Councillor Teskey called for a full time patching roster in the District due to public

concern at the timescale taken to fill potholes currently. Councillor Collins also noted

the Sugar CRM system does not have the facility to include Eircodes which would

provide exact locations for pothole filling to take place and asked for the system to be

upgraded to include this option.

Councillor Keary raised the issue of enforcement in relation to landowners cutting back

their hedgerows.

Discussion ensued in relation to Local Improvement Schemes (LIS) and Community

Involvement Schemes (CIS). Clarification was sought by Members in relation to using

GMA monies to upgrade public roads. The Senior Executive Engineer advised GMA

cannot be used to fund the community contribution under LIS or CIS schemes, however,

it can be allocated to public road maintenance.

This concluded the Meeting.

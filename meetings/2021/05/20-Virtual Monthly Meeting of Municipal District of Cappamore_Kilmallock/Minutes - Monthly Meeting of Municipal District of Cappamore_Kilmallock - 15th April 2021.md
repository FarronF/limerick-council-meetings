The Elected Members sought clarification as to whether a date had been set for the Housing

Support Services workshop and whether the Housing Engineer for the Cappamore

Kilmallock Municipal District could also be in attendance. It was confirmed that although a

date had not yet been set, the Director of Services, Ms A. Duke, had agreed to the workshop

in early May and would revert with a date.

The proposal for the disposal of a property at the Kilmallock Business Park was noted by the

Elected Members.

3. Environment

Illegal dumping.

The Senior Executive Engineer, Planning and Environment, provided a briefing to highlight

the feedback received from Environmental Inspectors regarding the increase in illegal

dumping across the county, including flytipping from cars, general litter and larger dumping

of household rubbish, furniture etc.

The areas of raising awareness, household surveys and specific targeting of offenders were

discussed. The number of prosecutions in the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District was

requested, and the senior Executive Engineer, Planning and Development agreed to revert

to the Elected Members with the detail.

A suggestion of the use of mobile CCTV Cameras was raised, however it was noted by

Director, Support Services-Finance, Corporate, HR & ICT that currently there is no legal basis

in legislation for the use of CCTV cameras in relation to litter. CCTV cameras currently in use
---

are by way of agreement with An Garda Siochana to detect crime. GDPR would not allow

for the collection of personal data e.g. personal images in this manner and therefore CCTV

cameras cannot be considered as a method of prevention of or detection of illegal

dumping/littering.

The work of Tidy Towns committees, TLC and other voluntary work, as well as the Roads

staff of Limerick City and County Council was acknowledged in the collection of litter.

4. Support Services Directorate

“These Standing Orders shall continue in force until altered, amended, or repealed. The

Standing Orders.”

It was also noted by the Meetings Administrator that the Standing Orders covering the

Online Meetings due to Covid needed to be reviewed before the 31st May 2021 with a view

to amending, removing or extending the use of these Standing Orders.

Following a discussion it was agreed that The Standing Orders relating to the use of Online

the Standing Orders would not take place until Government Restrictions were lifted. It was

NOTICES OF MOTIONS

1.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Egan

I will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that in

consultation with CIE the railway line from Limerick to Limerick Junction be upgraded to

ensure better connection to Cork.

**REPLY:**

The N/M20 Cork to Limerick project is currently considering a number of road-based

and rail-based options that improve connectivity between Cork and Limerick. One of

the rail-based options under consideration is one which proposes improved services

along the existing rail line between Cork-Mallow-Charleville-Limerick Junction-Limerick

with the introduction of a direct service that stops at Limerick Junction but removes the

requirement to change trains at Limerick Junction. The preferred option for the N/M20

Cork to Limerick project is scheduled to be identified by Q3 2021. Further information is

available at www.corklimerick.ie. In addition, please note Iarnród Éireann is

undertaking the Cork Line Level Crossings Project to identify the best approach to

removing/upgrading seven level crossings located along the main Cork to Dublin line.

These level crossings are being removed/upgraded to provide a safer environment for

those living near the rail line and a more efficient service for all Iarnród Éireann

customers. There are currently seven manned public road level crossings in operation

on the Cork to Dublin line between Limerick Junction and Mallow stations in Counties

Cork and Limerick. The crossings are located within a 24km section of the line between

the Cork and Limerick county boundary. The crossings are located at Fantstown,

Thomastown, Ballyhay, Newtown, Ballycoskery, Shinanagh and Buttevant. Further

information is available at https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/iarnrod-eireann-

projects-and-investments/cork-line-level-crossings-project. The Draft Limerick Shannon

Metropolitan Area Transportation Strategy (LSMATS) states the following in respect of

the rail line between Limerick and Limerick Junction:

*Objective RL2 Dual Track from Limerick Colbert to Limerick Junction. It is the intention*

*of the NTA, Iarnród Eireann and both local authorities to work in collaboration to:*

 *Investigate the feasibility of providing a dual-track between Limerick Colbert and*

*Limerick Junction to facilitate improved national and regional connectivity.*

It should be noted that the existing rail line between Limerick Colbert Station and

Killonan Junction, near Ballysimon is currently dual-track with the Limerick to Limerick

Junction and Limerick to Ballybrophy lines combining at Killonan Junction. Therefore

the Draft LSMATS objective RL2 relates to the improvement of the existing rail line

between Killonan Junction and Limerick Junction which is currently a single-track line

with a passing loop at Dromkeen.

**Proposed: Councillor Egan**

**Seconded: Councillor Donegan**

Further to the Notice of Motion above, it was agreed by all Elected Members that this

Notice of Motion be submitted to the full Council meeting.

2.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor M. Ryan

I will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that a

pedestrian crossing be established at Knocklong where the footpath drop down and

tactile paving is opposite the former site of the creamery and measures be implemented

to aide traffic calming.

**REPLY:**

Traffic calming measures can only be considered in conjunction with Limerick City and

County Council’s Traffic Calming Policy Document. The existing traffic volumes and

associated speeds in Knocklong will be surveyed in the coming weeks. An investigation

into accident records for the area will also be undertaken. Once these surveys are

completed, a determination will be made with respect to the requirement for traffic

calming measures.

Pedestrian crossing counts will also be carried out in conjunction with the traffic

volume and traffic speed surveys to determine a warrant for a pedestrian crossing.

**Proposed by: Councillor M Ryan**

**Seconded by: Councillor Mitchell**

3.Notice of Motion submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will move at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District that

appropriate traffic-calming measures be installed In Knocklong village as a matter of

urgency for safety of road users to slow traffic on the busy R513 immediately.

**REPLY:**

Traffic calming measures can only be considered in conjunction with Limerick City and

County Council’s Traffic Calming Policy Document. The existing traffic volumes and

associated speeds in Knocklong will be surveyed in the coming weeks. An investigation

into accident records for the area will also be undertaken. Once these surveys are

completed, a determination will be made with respect to the requirement for traffic

QUESTIONS

1.Question submitted by Councillor Egan

I will ask at the next Meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District when

work is going to commence on the Housing Project at the Old Creamery site in

Cappamore.

**REPLY:**

A formal Stage 3 submission for 10 units at Cappamore Village, Limerick (Cappamore

Housing Association - DHLGH ref. no CA15000207) was submitted by Limerick City and

County Council to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHLGH)

on the 24th March 2021.

In accordance with the 75 week programme for CAS Construction projects, Stage 3

approval is expected within 4 weeks of Stage 3 submission from the DHLGH – by the

21st April 2021.

Once Stage 3 approval is received Cappamore Housing Association has 10 weeks to run

a tender and prepare a tender report.

By week 10, a Stage 4 submission can be made to the DHLGH for approval – 10 week

deadline by 30th June 2021.

Stage 4 approval from the DHLGH is expected within 4 weeks from date of stage 4

submission – by the 28th July 2021.

Cappamore Housing Association then has 4 weeks to award a contract and mobilise a

contractor on site.

Subject to public health regulations, and the designation of certain social housing

projects as essential projects, an expected site-start date is September 2021.

Cappamore Housing Association may move to start on site sooner than September

2021, if a stage 4 submission can be lodged to the DHLGH earlier than 30th June 2021.

2.Question submitted by Councillor Donegan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District for an

update on the safety works planned for the railway bridge on Railway Road, Gotoon,

Kilmallock, including footpath replacement and improved signage for the safety of

pedestrians crossing the bridge.
---

**REPLY:**

Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal Area Office are proposing in the short term to meet

with Paul and Vincents with regard to getting a tree surgeon to fell the existing trees

inside the boundary as they are pushing out the boundary wall. The existing road width

does not allow for the construction of a footpath over the bridge and therefore other

options will have to be, explored with Irish Rail to determine how a footpath may be

achieved.

3.Question submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District if the

environment section can target prolific rubbish dumping in the Cappamore area.

**REPLY:**

The Environmental Department will review the Cappamore Area in relation to the level

of dumping of rubbish that is currently taking place there.

We will continue to exercise strong enforcement actions in relation to illegal dumping

and will pursue prosecutions wherever possible.

4.Question submitted by Councillor M Ryan

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District when the

footpath will be installed on R513 approaching Knocklong from bend on hospital road

to village.

**REPLY:**

Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal Area Office have included for these works in Schedule

of Works for Municipal Area and are planned to be carried out during Quarter 4 of

2021. These works will be dependent on agreement from respective landowners as

existing boundary ditch will have to be set back for the construction of this new

footpath.

5.Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District what is

the update in taking in charge of the Cluain Foinse Estate in Hospital town.

**REPLY:**

Tenders are being prepared in order to quantify the cost of works required to facilitate

bringing Cluain Foinse Estate to a taking in charge standard. Upon completion of these

works the formal taking in charge process will be commenced.

6.Question submitted by Councillor Mitchell

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore-Kilmallock Municipal District what the

reason is for the consistent water interruptions in Hospital area

**REPLY:**

Irish Water has invested extensively in improving and upgrading the local water supply in

recent years. This has included the development of a new borehole to safeguard the supply

and the replacement of much of the town’s water pipe network, including old lead pipes, in

2018. This has resulted in a generally safer, more secure water supply for Hospital and the

surrounding areas.

In recent weeks, an operational issue at the pumping station resulted in some disruption to

the local supply. This was resolved as quickly as possible and normal water supply was

restored. Irish Water and Limerick City and County Council apologies for any inconvenience

as a result of this issues. When such unplanned operational issues arise, we work with local

crews to resolve them as quickly as possible and minimise disruption to our customers.

Details of supply disruptions are posted on the Water Supply Updates section of the Irish

Water website and via Twitter @IWCare. Customers with queries or concerns can also

contact Irish Water directly on our customer care helpline, open 24/7, on 1850 278 278

7.Question submitted by Councillor Teefy

I will ask at the next meeting of the Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal District to investigate

the possibility of putting a footpath on the R513 from the Primary School, Hospital to Sully’s

Cross (O’Sullivans) L8504 which is used as a loop walk by a large number of walkers.

**REPLY:**

The Cappamore Kilmallock Municipal Area Office included for a footpath at this location

under recent Active Travel Measures funding. Unfortunately, this application was not

successful in securing funding. It will remain on a priority list for future funding streams

Any Other Business

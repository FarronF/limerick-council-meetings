Fairtrade products available worldwide.

---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

REPLY: irish Water issued the Newcastle West Municipal District Wastewater Capacity
Register dated 17" June 2020 (attached) in response to part (a).

Please note below the response received from Irish Water in response to part
(b).

“Newcastle West Wastewater Treatment WWTP upgrade project is included in
the 2020-2024 IW Investment Plan and has recently commenced. The project
is at a very early stage (concept design) and as such providing completion dates
at this stage is difficult. It is anticipated it will be post 2025, and within the
lifetime of the 2011-2028 Limerick Development Plan, before the WWTP
project is completed. This will be subject to funding and other approvals.

Clir. Ruddle expressed dissatisfaction with the response.

It was noted that the reply stated that the Newcastle West Waste Water Treatment Plant is
at capacity and concern was expressed at the length of time it could take before an upgrade
would be carried out. This would hinder developments for the town for possibly 5-7 years.
It was also noted that businesses are interested in setting up in the town but cannot get
connections to the sewer network due to lack of capacity. Also housing developments
cannot progress due to the same issue.

It was also noted that housing developments for smaller towns and villages within the
District are also being denied connections to water and waste water treatment facilities due
to lack of capacity. The implications of this for any future County Development Plan was also
highlighted

Following discussion on the above, it was agreed that an urgent Meeting should be sought
with Senior Staff in Irish Water with regard these matters.

12. Question submitted by Councillor T. Ruddile

! will ask at the next Meeting (a) what is the current position with the installation of street
furniture (seating and parklets) which were agreed last September for the Square,
Newcastle West (b) an update on the request for seats and parklets outside of Lee’s and
Cronin’s bars The Square, Newcastle West (c) also consideration to be given to erecting a
fountain in the Square similar to Abbeyfeale and Athea highlighting links with
Ballygowan, St. David’s Well and the Knight’s Templar.

REPLY:

(a) No funding has been received to progress the installation of parklets. Also the exact
locations will have to be agreed with the nearby businesses.


---
*<small>Scanned page, text may contain errors. See original file for clarity</small>*  

(b) As previously advised the owners of Lee’s and Cronin’s Bar may apply for a licence to
Council’s Planning Department with regard to outdoor seating. No applications have
been received to date.

However if the applications are received and are successful, there may be implications
for parking bays within the Square as parking spaces may need to be removed if
licences are granted.

(c) This request could be considered under the Draft Newcastle West Public Realm and
Movement Plan.

The Director stated that a funding stream was recently announced by Government and the
Physical Development Directorate was involved in progressing parklets and outdoor seating

areas. He also stated that businesses can also apply for funding for outdoor seating under this
new funding stream.
